acquired the hospital of st james which became st james s palace from eton college and in he took the manor of ebury from westminster abbey these transfers brought the site of buckingham palace back into royal hands for the first time since william the conqueror had given it away almost years earlier various owners leased it from royal landlords and the freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation during the th century by then the old village of eye cross had long since fallen into decay and the area was mostly wasteland needing money james vi and i sold off part of the crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a four acre ha mulberry garden for the production of silk this is at the north west corner of today s palace clement walker in anarchia anglicana refers to new erected sodoms and spintries at the mulberry garden at s james s this suggests it may have been a place of debauchery eventually in the late th century the freehold was inherited from the property tycoon sir hugh audley by the great heiress mary davies c possibly the first house erected within the site was that of sir william blake around the next owner was lord goring who from extended blake s house which came to be known as goring house and developed much of today s garden then known as goring great garden he did not however obtain the freehold interest in the mulberry garden unbeknown to goring in the document failed to pass the great seal before charles i fled london which it needed to do for legal execution it was this critical omission that would help the british royal family regain the freehold under george iii when the improvident goring defaulted on his rents henry bennet st earl of arlington was able to purchase the lease of goring house and he was occupying it when it burned down in following which he constructed arlington house on the site the location of the southern wing of today s palace the next year in john sheffield acquired

block with two smaller flanking service wings it was eventually sold by buckingham s illegitimate son sir charles sheffield in to george iii for d sheffield s leasehold on the mulberry garden site the freehold of which was still owned by the royal family was due to expire in under the new royal ownership the building was originally intended as a private retreat for queen charlotte and was accordingly known as the queen s house remodelling of the structure began in in an act of parliament settled the property on queen charlotte in exchange for her rights to nearby somerset house e and of her children were born there some furnishings were transferred from carlton house and others had been bought in france after the french revolution of while st james s palace remained the official and ceremonial royal residence the name buckingham palace was used from at least after his accession to the throne in george iv continued the renovation intending to create a small comfortable home however in while the work was in progress the king decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect john nash the external fa ade was designed keeping in mind the french neoclassical influence preferred by george iv the cost of the renovations grew dramatically and by the extravagance of nash s designs resulted in his removal as the architect on the death of george iv in his younger brother william iv hired edward blore to finish the work william never moved into the palace after the palace of westminster was destroyed by fire in he offered to convert buckingham palace into a new houses of parliament but his offer was declined buckingham palace became the principal royal residence in on the accession of queen victoria who was the first monarch to reside there her predecessor william iv had died before its completion while the state rooms were a riot of gilt and colour the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down and consequently the palace was often cold ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled and when it was decided to install gas lamps there was a serious worry about the build up of gas on the lower floors it was also said that the staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty following the queen s marriage in her husband prince albert concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff and with addressing the design faults of the palace by the end of all the problems had been rectified however the builders were to return within a decade by the couple had found the palace too small for court life and their growing family and a new wing designed by edward blore was built by thomas cubitt enclosing the central quadrangle the large east front facing the mall is today the public face of buckingham palace and contains the balcony from which the royal family acknowledge the crowds on momentous occasions and after the annual trooping the colour the ballroom wing and a further suite of state rooms were also built in this period designed by nash s student sir james pennethorne before

and osborne house for many years the palace was seldom used even neglected in a note was found pinned to the fence of buckingham palace saying these commanding premises to be let or sold in consequence of the late occupant s declining business eventually public opinion persuaded the queen to return to london though even then she preferred to live elsewhere whenever possible court functions were still held at windsor castle presided over by the sombre queen habitually dressed in mourning black while buckingham palace remained shuttered for most of the year in the new king edward vii began redecorating the palace the king and his wife queen alexandra had always been at the forefront of london high society and their friends known as the marlborough house set were considered to be the most eminent and fashionable of the age buckingham palace the ballroom grand entrance marble hall grand staircase vestibules and galleries were redecorated in the belle poque cream and gold colour scheme they retain today once again became a setting for entertaining on a majestic scale but leaving some to feel edward s heavy redecorations were at odds with nash s original work the last major building work took place during the reign of george v when in sir aston webb redesigned blore s east front to resemble in part giacomo leoni s lyme park in cheshire this new refaced principal fa ade of portland stone was designed to be the backdrop to the victoria memorial a large memorial statue of queen victoria created by sculptor sir thomas brock erected outside the main gates on a surround constructed by architect sir aston webb george v who had succeeded edward vii in had a more serious personality than his father greater emphasis was now placed on official entertainment and royal duties than on lavish parties he arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the original dixieland jazz band the first jazz performance for a head of state sidney bechet and louis armstrong which earned the palace a nomination in for a kind of blue plaque by the brecon jazz festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the united kingdom during the first world war which lasted from until the palace escaped unscathed its more valuable contents were evacuated to windsor but the royal family remained in residence the king imposed rationing at the palace much to the dismay of his guests and household to the king s later regret david lloyd george persuaded him to go further and ostentatiously lock the wine cellars and refrain from alcohol to set a good example to the supposedly inebriated working class the workers continued to imbibe and the king was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence george v s wife queen mary was a connoisseur of the arts and took a keen interest in the royal collection of furniture and art both restoring and adding to it queen mary also had many new fixtures and fittings

 the berlin wall german berliner mauer pronounced b li n ma listen was a guarded concrete barrier that divided berlin from to it encircled west berlin separating it from east german territory construction of the wall was commenced by the german democratic republic gdr east germany on august the wall cut off west berlin from surrounding east germany including east berlin it included guard towers placed along large concrete walls accompanied by a wide area later known as the death strip that contained anti vehicle trenches beds of nails and other defenses the eastern bloc portrayed the wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the will of the people from building a socialist state in east germany gdr authorities officially referred to the berlin wall as the anti fascist protection rampart german antifaschistischer schutzwall pronounced antifa st t sval listen the west berlin city government sometimes referred to it as the wall of shame a term coined by mayor willy brandt in reference to the wall s restriction on freedom of movement along with the separate and much longer inner german border igb which demarcated the border between east and west germany it came to symbolize physically the iron curtain that separated western europe and the eastern bloc during the cold war before the wall s erection million east germans circumvented eastern bloc emigration restrictions and defected from the gdr many by crossing over the border from east berlin into west berlin from there they could then travel to west germany and to other western european countries between and the wall prevented almost all such emigration during this period over people attempted to escape and over people succeeded in escaping over the wall with an estimated death toll ranging from to more than in and around berlin in a series of revolutions in nearby eastern bloc countries in poland and hungary in particular caused a chain reaction in east germany in particular the pan european picnic in august set in motion a peaceful development during which the iron curtain largely broke the rulers in the east came under pressure the berlin wall fell and finally the eastern bloc fell apart after several weeks of civil unrest the east german government announced on november that all gdr citizens could visit west germany and west berlin crowds of east germans crossed and climbed onto the wall joined by west germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere over the next few weeks the likes of souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the wall the brandenburg gate a few meters from the berlin wall was opened on december the demolition of the wall officially began on june and was completed in the fall of the berlin wall paved the way for german reunification which formally took place on october after the end of world war ii in europe what remained of pre war germany west of the oder neisse line was divided into four occupation zones as per the potsdam agreement each one controlled by one of the four occupying allied powers the united states the united kingdom france and the soviet union the capital of berlin as the seat of the allied control council was similarly subdivided into four sectors despite the city s location which was fully within the soviet zone within two years political divisions increased between the soviets and the other occupying powers these included the soviets refusal to agree to reconstruction plans making post war germany self sufficient and to a detailed accounting of industrial plants goods and infrastructure some of which had already been removed by the soviets france the united kingdom the united states and the benelux countries later met to combine the non soviet zones of germany into one zone for reconstruction and to approve the extension of the marshall plan following the defeat of nazi germany in world war ii the soviet union engineered the installation of communist governments in most of the countries occupied by soviet military forces at the end of the war including poland hungary czechoslovakia bulgaria romania and the gdr which together with albania formed the comecon in and later a military alliance the warsaw pact this bloc of nations was set up by the soviets in opposition to nato in the capitalist west in what became the cold war since the end of the war the soviets together with like minded east germans created a new soviet style regime in the soviet zone and later the gdr on a centrally planned socialist economic model with nationalized means of production and with repressive police state institutions under party dictatorship of the sed sozialistische einheitspartei deutschlands socialist unity party of germany similar to the party dictatorship of the soviet communist party in the ussr at the same time a parallel regime was established under the strict control of the western powers in the zones of post war germany occupied by them culminating in the foundation of the federal republic of germany in which initially claimed to be the sole legitimate power in all of germany east and west the material standard of living in the western zones of berlin began to improve quickly and residents of the soviet zone soon began leaving for the west in large numbers fleeing hunger poverty and repression in the soviet zone for a better life in the west soon residents of other parts of the soviet zone began to escape to the west through berlin and this migration called in germany republikflucht deprived the soviet zone not only of working forces desperately needed for post war reconstruction but disproportionately highly educated people which came to be known as the brain drain citation needed in in response to moves by the western powers to establish a separate federal system of government in the western zones and to extend the marshall plan to germany the soviets instituted the berlin blockade preventing people food materials and supplies from arriving in west berlin by land routes through the soviet zone the united states the united kingdom france canada australia new zealand and several other countries began a massive airlift supplying west berlin with food and other supplies the soviets mounted a public relations campaign against the western policy change communists attempted to disrupt the elections of preceding large losses therein while berliners demonstrated for the international airlift to continue in may stalin lifted the blockade permitting the resumption of western shipments to berlin the german democratic republic the gdr east germany was declared on october on that day the ussr ended the soviet military government which had governed the soviet occupation zone sowetische besatzungszone since the end of the war and handed over legal power page needed to the provisorische volkskammer under the new constitution of the gdr which came into force that day however until the soviets maintained considerable legal control over the gdr state including the regional governments through the sowetische kontrollkommission and maintained a presence in various east german administrative military and secret police structures even after legal sovereignty of the gdr was restored in the soviet union continued to maintain considerable influence over administration and lawmaking in the gdr through the soviet embassy and through the implicit threat of force which could be exercised through the continuing large soviet military presence in the gdr which was used to repress protests in east germany bloodily in june east germany differed from west germany federal republic of germany which developed into a western capitalist country with a social market economy and a democratic parliamentary government continual economic growth starting in the s fueled a year economic miracle wirtschaftswunder as west germany s economy grew and its standard of living steadily improved many east germans wanted to move to west germany after the soviet occupation of eastern europe at the end of world war ii the majority of those living in the newly acquired areas of the eastern bloc aspired to independence and wanted the soviets to leave taking advantage of the zonal border between occupied zones in germany the number of gdr citizens moving to west germany totaled in in in and in one reason for the sharp increase was fear of potential further sovietization given the increasingly paranoid actions of joseph stalin in late and early in the first six months of had fled by the early s the soviet approach to controlling national movement restricting emigration was emulated by most of the rest of the eastern bloc including east germany the restrictions presented a quandary for some eastern bloc states which had been more economically advanced and open than the soviet union such that crossing borders seemed more natural especially where no prior border existed between east and west germany up until the demarcation lines between east germany and the western occupied zones could be easily crossed in most places on april east german leaders met the soviet leader joseph stalin in moscow during the discussions stalin s foreign minister vyacheslav molotov proposed that the east germans should introduce a system of passes for visits of west berlin residents to the territory of east berlin so as to stop free movement of western agents in the gdr stalin agreed calling the situation intolerable he advised the east germans to build up their border defenses telling them that the demarcation line between east and west germany should be considered a border and not just any border but a dangerous one the germans will guard the line of defence with their lives consequently the inner german border between the two german states was closed and a barbed wire fence erected the border between the western and eastern sectors of berlin however remained open although traffic between the soviet and the western sectors was somewhat restricted this resulted in berlin becoming a magnet for east germans desperate to escape life in the gdr and also a flashpoint for tension between the united states and the soviet union in the soviets gave east germany authority over civilian movement in berlin passing control to a regime not recognized in the west initially east germany granted visits to allow its residents access to west germany however following the defection of large numbers of east germans known as republikflucht under this regime the new east german state legally restricted virtually all travel to the west in soviet east german ambassador mikhail pervukhin observed that the presence in berlin of an open and essentially uncontrolled border between the socialist and capitalist worlds unwittingly prompts the population to make a comparison between both parts of the city which unfortunately does not always turn out in favour of democratic east berlin with the closing of the inner german border officially in the border in berlin remained considerably more accessible because it was administered by all four occupying powers accordingly berlin became the main route by which east germans left for the west on december east germany introduced a new passport law that reduced the overall number of refugees leaving eastern germany it had the unintended result of drastically increasing the percentage of those leaving through west berlin from to well over by the end of those caught trying to leave east berlin were subjected to heavy penalties but with no physical barrier and subway train access still available to west berlin such measures were ineffective the berlin sector border was essentially a loophole through which eastern bloc citizens could still escape the million east germans who had left by totalled approximately of the entire east german population an important reason that passage between east germany and west berlin was not stopped earlier was that doing so would cut off much of the railway traffic in east germany construction of a new railway bypassing west berlin the berlin outer ring commenced in following the completion of the railway in closing the border became a more practical proposition citation needed the emigrants tended to be young and well educated leading to the brain drain feared by officials in east germany yuri andropov then the cpsu director on relations with communist and workers parties of socialist countries wrote an urgent letter on august to the central committee about the significant increase in the number of east german intelligentsia among the refugees andropov reported that while the east german leadership stated that they were leaving for economic reasons testimony from refugees indicated that the reasons were more political than material he stated the flight of the intelligentsia has reached a particularly critical phase by the combination of world war ii and the massive emigration westward left east germany with only of its population of working age compared to before the war the loss was disproportionately heavy among professionals engineers technicians physicians teachers lawyers and skilled workers the direct cost of manpower losses to east germany and corresponding gain to the west has been estimated at billion to billion with east german party leader walter ulbricht later claiming that west germany owed him billion in compensation including reparations as well as manpower losses in addition the drain of east germany s young population potentially cost it over billion marks in lost educational investment the brain drain of professionals had become so damaging to the political credibility and economic viability of east germany that the re securing of the german communist frontier was imperative the exodus of emigrants from east germany presented two minor potential benefits an easy way to smuggle east german secret agents to west germany and a reduction in the number of citizens hostile to the communist regime neither of these advantages however proved particularly useful on june first secretary of the socialist unity party and gdr state council chairman walter ulbricht stated in an international press conference niemand hat die absicht eine mauer zu errichten no one has the intention of erecting a wall it was the first time the colloquial term mauer wall had been used in this context the transcript of a telephone call between nikita khrushchev and ulbricht on august in the same year suggests that the initiative for the construction of the wall came from khrushchev however other sources suggest that khrushchev had initially been wary about building a wall fearing negative western reaction nevertheless ulbricht had pushed for a border closure for some time arguing that east germany s existence was at stake page needed khrushchev had become emboldened upon seeing us president john f kennedy s youth and inexperience which he considered a weakness in the vienna summit kennedy made the error of admitting that the us wouldn t actively oppose the building of a barrier a feeling of miscalculation and failure immediately afterwards was admitted by kennedy in a candid interview with new york times columnist james scotty reston on saturday august the leaders of the gdr attended a garden party at a government guesthouse in d llnsee in a wooded area to the north of east berlin there ulbricht signed the order to close the border and erect a wall at midnight the police and units of the east german army began to close the border and by sunday morning august the border with west berlin was closed east german troops and workers had begun to tear up streets running alongside the border to make them impassable to most vehicles and to install barbed wire entanglements and fences along the kilometres mi around the three western sectors and the kilometres mi that divided west and east berlin the date of august became commonly referred to as barbed wire sunday in germany the barrier was built inside east berlin on east german territory to ensure that it did not encroach on west berlin at any point generally the wall was only slightly inside east berlin but in a few places it was some distance from the legal border most notably at potsdamer bahnhof and the lenn triangle that is now much of the potsdamer platz development later the initial barrier was built up into the wall proper the first concrete elements and large blocks being put in place on august during the construction of the wall national people s army nva and combat groups of the working class kda soldiers stood in front of it with orders to shoot anyone who attempted to defect additionally chain fences walls minefields and other obstacles were installed along the length of east germany s western border with west germany proper a huge no man s land was cleared to provide a clear line of fire at fleeing refugees with the closing of the east west sector boundary in berlin the vast majority of east germans could no longer travel or emigrate to west germany berlin soon went from being the easiest place to make an unauthorized crossing between east and west germany to being the most difficult many families were split while east berliners employed in the west were cut off from their jobs west berlin became an isolated exclave in a hostile land west berliners demonstrated against the wall led by their mayor oberb rgermeister willy brandt who criticized the united states for failing to respond and went so far as to suggest to washington what to do next kennedy was furious allied intelligence agencies had hypothesized about a wall to stop the flood of refugees but the main candidate for its location was around the perimeter of the city in secretary of state dean rusk proclaimed the wall certainly ought not to be a permanent feature of the european landscape i see no reason why the soviet union should think it is it is to their advantage in any way to leave there that monument to communist failure united states and uk sources had expected the soviet sector to be sealed off from west berlin but were surprised by how long the east germans took for such a move they considered the wall as an end to concerns about a gdr soviet retaking or capture of the whole of berlin the wall would presumably have been an unnecessary project if such plans were afloat thus they concluded that the possibility of a soviet military conflict over berlin had decreased the east german government claimed that the wall was an anti fascist protective rampart german antifaschistischer schutzwall intended to dissuade aggression from the west another official justification was the activities of western agents in eastern europe the eastern german government also claimed that west berliners were buying out state subsidized goods in east berlin east germans and others greeted such statements with skepticism as most of the time the border was only closed for citizens of east germany traveling to the west but not for residents of west berlin travelling to the east the construction of the wall had caused considerable hardship to families divided by it most people believed that the wall was mainly a means of preventing the citizens of east germany from entering or fleeing to west berlin the national security agency was the only american intelligence agency that was aware that east germany was to take action to deal with the brain drain problem on august the nsa intercepted an advance warning information of the socialist unity party s plan to close the intra berlin border between east and west berlin completely for foot traffic the interagency intelligence berlin watch committee assessed that this intercept might be the first step in a plan to close the border this warning did not reach john f kennedy until noon on august while he was vacationing in his yacht off the kennedy compound in hyannis port massachusetts while kennedy was angry that he had no advance warning he was relieved that the east germans and the soviets had only divided berlin without taking any action against west berlin s access to the west however he denounced the berlin wall whose erection worsened the relations between the united states and the soviet union in response to the erection of the berlin wall a retired general lucius d clay was appointed by kennedy as his special advisor with ambassadorial rank clay had been the military governor of the us zone of occupation in germany during the period of the berlin blockade and had ordered the first measures in what became the berlin airlift he was immensely popular with the residents of west berlin and his appointment was an unambiguous sign that kennedy would not compromise on the status of west berlin as a symbolic gesture kennedy sent clay and vice president lyndon b johnson to west berlin they landed at tempelhof airport on the afternoon of saturday august and were greeted enthusiastically by the local population they arrived in a city defended by three allied brigades one each from the uk berlin infantry brigade the us berlin brigade and france forces fran aises berlin on august kennedy had given the order for them to be reinforced early on august the st battle group th infantry regiment commanded by colonel glover s johns jr was alerted on sunday morning u s troops marched from west germany through east germany bound for west berlin lead elements arranged in a column of vehicles and trailers carrying men divided into five march units left the helmstedt marienborn checkpoint at at marienborn the soviet checkpoint next to helmstedt on the west german east german border us personnel were counted by guards the column was kilometres mi long and covered kilometres mi from marienborn to berlin in full battle gear east german police watched from beside trees next to the autobahn all the way along the front of the convoy arrived at the outskirts of berlin just before noon to be met by clay and johnson before parading through the streets of berlin in front of a large crowd at on august lyndon johnson left west berlin in the hands of general frederick o hartel and his brigade of officers and men for the next three and a half years american battalions would rotate into west berlin by autobahn at three month intervals to demonstrate allied rights to the city the creation of the wall had important implications for both german states by stemming the exodus of people from east germany the east german government was able to reassert its control over the country in spite of discontent with the wall economic problems caused by dual currency and the black market were largely eliminated the economy in the gdr began to grow however the wall proved a public relations disaster for the communist bloc as a whole western powers portrayed it as a symbol of communist tyranny particularly after east german border guards shot and killed would be defectors such fatalities were later treated as acts of murder by the reunified germany the berlin wall was more than kilometres mi long in june a second parallel fence also known as a hinterland wall inner wall was built some metres yd farther into east german territory the houses contained between the wall and fences were razed and the inhabitants relocated thus establishing what later became known as the death strip the death strip was covered with raked sand or gravel rendering footprints easy to notice easing the detection of trespassers and also enabling officers to see which guards had neglected their task it offered no cover and most importantly it offered clear fields of fire for the wall guards through the years the berlin wall evolved through four versions the fourth generation wall known officially as st tzwandelement ul retaining wall element ul was the final and most sophisticated version of the wall begun in and completed about it was constructed from separate sections of reinforced concrete each metres ft high and metres ft wide and cost ddm or about us the concrete provisions added to this version of the wall were done to prevent escapees from driving their cars through the barricades at strategic points the wall was constructed to a somewhat weaker standard so that east german and soviet armored vehicles could easily break through in the event of war the top of the wall was lined with a smooth pipe intended to make it more difficult to scale the wall was reinforced by mesh fencing signal fencing anti vehicle trenches barbed wire dogs on long lines beds of nails also known as stalin s carpet under balconies hanging over the death strip over watchtowers and bunkers with hundreds of guards this version of the wall is the one most commonly seen in photographs and surviving fragments of the wall in berlin and elsewhere around the world are generally pieces of the fourth generation wall the layout came to resemble the inner german border in most technical aspects except that the berlin wall had no landmines nor spring guns maintenance was performed on the outside of the wall by personnel who accessed the area outside it either via ladders or via hidden doors within the wall these doors could not be opened by a single person needing two separate keys in two separate keyholes to unlock as was the case with the inner german border an unfortified strip of eastern territory was left outside the wall this outer strip was used by workers to paint over graffiti and perform other maintenance on the outside of the wall unlike the inner german border however the outer strip was usually no more than four meters wide and in photos from the era the exact location of the actual border in many places appears not even to have been marked also in contrast with the inner german border little interest was shown by east german law enforcement in keeping outsiders off the outer strip sidewalks of west berlin streets even ran inside it despite the east german government s general policy of benign neglect vandals were known to have been pursued in the outer strip and even arrested in defector and political activist wolfram hasch and four other defectors were standing inside the outer strip defacing the wall when east german personnel emerged from one of the hidden doors to apprehend them all but hasch escaped back into the western sector hasch himself was arrested dragged through the door into the death strip and later convicted of illegally crossing the de jure border outside the wall graffiti artist thierry noir has reported having often been pursued there by east german soldiers while some graffiti artists were chased off the outer strip others such as keith haring were seemingly tolerated besides the sector sector boundary within berlin itself the wall also separated west berlin from the present day state of brandenburg the following present day municipalities listed in counter clockwise direction share a border with the former west berlin there were nine border crossings between east and west berlin these allowed visits by west berliners other west germans western foreigners and allied personnel into east berlin as well as visits by gdr citizens and citizens of other socialist countries into west berlin provided that they held the necessary permits these crossings were restricted according to which nationality was allowed to use it east germans west germans west berliners other countries the best known was the vehicle and pedestrian checkpoint at the corner of friedrichstra e and zimmerstra e checkpoint charlie which was restricted to allied personnel and foreigners several other border crossings existed between west berlin and surrounding east germany these could be used for transit between west germany and west berlin for visits by west berliners into east germany for transit into countries neighbouring east germany poland czechoslovakia denmark and for visits by east germans into west berlin carrying a permit after the agreements new crossings were opened to allow west berlin waste to be transported into east german dumps as well as some crossings for access to west berlin s exclaves see steinst cken four autobahns connected west berlin to west germany including berlin helmstedt autobahn which entered east german territory between the towns of helmstedt and marienborn checkpoint alpha and which entered west berlin at dreilinden checkpoint bravo for the allied forces in southwestern berlin access to west berlin was also possible by railway four routes and by boat for commercial shipping via canals and rivers non german westerners could cross the border at friedrichstra e station in east berlin and at checkpoint charlie when the wall was erected berlin s complex public transit networks the s bahn and u bahn were divided with it some lines were cut in half many stations were shut down three western lines traveled through brief sections of east berlin territory passing through eastern stations called geisterbahnh fe or ghost stations without stopping both the eastern and western networks converged at friedrichstra e which became a major crossing point for those mostly westerners with permission to cross west germans and citizens of other western countries could generally visit east germany often after applying for a visa at an east german embassy several weeks in advance visas for day trips restricted to east berlin were issued without previous application in a simplified procedure at the border crossing however east german authorities could refuse entry permits without stating a reason in the s visitors from the western part of the city who wanted to visit the eastern part had to exchange at least dm into east german currency at the poor exchange rate of it was forbidden to export east german currency from the east but money not spent could be left at the border for possible future visits tourists crossing from the west had to also pay for a visa which cost dm west berliners did not have to pay this fee west berliners initially could not visit east berlin or east germany at all all crossing points were closed to them between august and december in negotiations between east and west resulted in a limited possibility for visits during the christmas season that year passierscheinregelung similar very limited arrangements were made in and in with the four power agreement on berlin agreements were reached that allowed west berliners to apply for visas to enter east berlin and east germany regularly comparable to the regulations already in force for west germans however east german authorities could still refuse entry permits east berliners and east germans could not at first travel to west berlin or west germany at all this regulation remained in force essentially until the fall of the wall but over the years several exceptions to these rules were introduced the most significant being for each of these exceptions gdr citizens had to apply for individual approval which was never guaranteed in addition even if travel was approved gdr travellers could exchange only a very small amount of east german marks into deutsche marks dm thus limiting the financial resources available for them to travel to the west this led to the west german practice of granting a small amount of dm annually begr ungsgeld or welcome money to gdr citizens visiting west germany and west berlin to help alleviate this situation citizens of other east european countries were in general subject to the same prohibition of visiting western countries as east germans though the applicable exception if any varied from country to country allied military personnel and civilian officials of the allied forces could enter and exit east berlin without submitting to east german passport controls purchasing a visa or being required to exchange money likewise soviet military patrols could enter and exit west berlin this was a requirement of the post war four powers agreements a particular area of concern for the western allies involved official dealings with east german authorities when crossing the border since allied policy did not recognize the authority of the gdr to regulate allied military traffic to and from west berlin as well as the allied presence within greater berlin including entry into exit from and presence within east berlin the allies held that only the soviet union and not the gdr had the authority to regulate allied personnel in such cases for this reason elaborate procedures were established to prevent inadvertent recognition of east german authority when engaged in travel through the gdr and when in east berlin special rules applied to travel by western allied military personnel assigned to the military liaison missions accredited to the commander of soviet forces in east germany located in potsdam allied personnel were restricted by policy when travelling by land to the following routes as with military personnel special procedures applied to travel by diplomatic personnel of the western allies accredited to their respective embassies in the gdr this was intended to prevent inadvertent recognition of east german authority when crossing between east and west berlin which could jeopardize the overall allied position governing the freedom of movement by allied forces personnel within all berlin ordinary citizens of the western allied powers not formally affiliated with the allied forces were authorized to use all designated transit routes through east germany to and from west berlin regarding travel to east berlin such persons could also use the friedrichstra e train station to enter and exit the city in addition to checkpoint charlie in these instances such travelers unlike allied personnel had to submit to east german border controls during the years of the wall around people successfully defected to west berlin the number of people who died trying to cross the wall or as a result of the wall s existence has been disputed the most vocal claims by alexandra hildebrandt director of the checkpoint charlie museum and widow of the museum s founder estimated the death toll to be well above a historic research group at the centre for contemporary history zzf in potsdam has confirmed at least deaths prior official figures listed as being killed the east german government issued shooting orders schie befehl to border guards dealing with defectors though such orders are not the same as shoot to kill orders gdr officials denied issuing the latter in an october order later discovered by researchers guards were instructed that people attempting to cross the wall were criminals and needed to be shot do not hesitate to use your firearm not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children which is a tactic the traitors have often used early successful escapes involved people jumping the initial barbed wire or leaping out of apartment windows along the line but these ended as the wall was fortified east german authorities no longer permitted apartments near the wall to be occupied and any building near the wall had its windows boarded and later bricked up on august conrad schumann was the first east german border guard to escape by jumping the barbed wire to west berlin on august ida siekmann was the first casualty at the berlin wall she died after she jumped out of her third floor apartment at bernauer strasse the first person to be shot and killed while trying to cross to west berlin was g nter litfin a twenty four year old tailor he attempted to swim across the spree to west berlin on august the same day that east german police had received shoot to kill orders to prevent anyone from escaping another dramatic escape was carried out in april by wolfgang engels a year old civilian employee of the nationale volksarmee nva engels stole a soviet armored personnel carrier from a base where he was deployed and drove it right into the wall he was fired at and seriously wounded by border guards but a west german policeman intervened firing his weapon at the east german border guards the policeman removed engels from the vehicle which had become entangled in the barbed wire east germans successfully defected by a variety of methods digging long tunnels under the wall waiting for favorable winds and taking a hot air balloon sliding along aerial wires flying ultralights and in one instance simply driving a sports car at full speed through the basic initial fortifications when a metal beam was placed at checkpoints to prevent this kind of defection up to four people two in the front seats and possibly two in the boot drove under the bar in a sports car that had been modified to allow the roof and windscreen to come away when it made contact with the beam they lay flat and kept driving forward the east germans then built zig zagging roads at checkpoints the sewer system predated the wall and some people escaped through the sewers in a number of cases with assistance from the unternehmen reiseb ro in september people escaped through a tunnel to the west at least tunnels were dug under the wall only were successful in allowing fugitives about persons to escape the east germany authorities eventually used seismographic and acoustic equipment to detect the practice in they planned an attempt to use explosives to destroy one tunnel but this was not carried out as it was apparently sabotaged by a member of the stasi an airborne escape was made by thomas kr ger who landed a zlin z m light aircraft of the gesellschaft f r sport und technik an east german youth military training organization at raf gatow his aircraft registration ddr woh was dismantled and returned to the east germans by road complete with humorous slogans painted on it by airmen of the royal air force such as wish you were here and come back soon if an escapee was wounded in a crossing attempt and lay on the death strip no matter how close they were to the western wall westerners could not intervene for fear of triggering engaging fire from the grepos the east berlin border guards the guards often let fugitives bleed to death in the middle of this ground as in the most notorious failed attempt that of peter fechter aged at a point near zimmerstrasse in east berlin he was shot and bled to death in full view of the western media on august fechter s death created negative publicity worldwide that led the leaders of east berlin to place more restrictions on shooting in public places and provide medical care for possible would be escapers the last person to be shot and killed while trying to cross the border was chris gueffroy on february while the final person to die in an escape attempt was winfried freudenberg who was killed when his homemade natural gas filled balloon crashed on march the wall gave rise to a widespread sense of desperation and oppression in east berlin as expressed in the private thoughts of one resident who confided to her diary our lives have lost their spirit we can do nothing to stop them on june david bowie who earlier for several years lived and recorded in west berlin played a concert close to the wall this was attended by thousands of eastern concertgoers across the wall followed by violent rioting in east berlin according to tobias ruther these protests in east berlin were the first in the sequence of riots that led to those of november although other factors were probably more influential in the fall of the wall upon his death in the german foreign office tweeted good bye david bowie you are now among heroes thank you for helping to bring down the wall on july months before the wall came down bruce springsteen and the e street band played rocking the wall a live concert in east berlin which was attended by in person and broadcast on television springsteen spoke to the crowd in german saying i m not here for or against any government i ve come to play rock n roll for you in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down east germany and its fdj youth organization were worried they were losing an entire generation they hoped that by letting springsteen in they could improve their sentiment among east germans however this strategy of one step backwards two steps forwards backfired and the concert only made east germans hungrier for more of the freedoms that springsteen epitomized while john f kennedy and ronald reagan delivered their famous speeches from the safety of west berlin springsteen s speaking out against the wall in the middle of east berlin added to the euphoria on december american tv actor and pop music singer david hasselhoff was the headlining performer for the freedom tour live concert which was attended by over people on both sides of the wall the live concert footage was directed by music video director thomas mignone and aired on broadcast television station zweites deutsches fernsehen zdf throughout europe during shooting film crew personnel pulled people up from both sides to stand and celebrate on top of the wall hasselhoff sang his number one hit song looking for freedom on a platform at the end of a twenty meter steel crane that swung above and over the wall adjacent to the brandenburg gate a small museum was created in to celebrate hasselhoff in the basement of the circus hostel on june months after the erection of the berlin wall u s president john f kennedy visited west berlin speaking from a platform erected on the steps of rathaus sch neberg for an audience of and straying from the prepared script he declared in his ich bin ein berliner speech the support of the united states for west germany and the people of west berlin in particular two thousand years ago the proudest boast was civis romanus sum i am a roman citizen today in the world of freedom the proudest boast is ich bin ein berliner all free men wherever they may live are citizens of berlin and therefore as a free man i take pride in the words ich bin ein berliner the message was aimed as much at the soviets as it was at berliners and was a clear statement of u s policy in the wake of the construction of the berlin wall the speech is considered one of kennedy s best both a significant moment in the cold war and a high point of the new frontier it was a great morale boost for west berliners who lived in an exclave deep inside east germany and feared a possible east german occupation former british prime minister margaret thatcher commented in every stone bears witness to the moral bankruptcy of the society it encloses in a speech at the brandenburg gate commemorating the th anniversary of berlin on june u s president ronald reagan challenged mikhail gorbachev then the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union to tear down the wall as a symbol of increasing freedom in the eastern bloc we welcome change and openness for we believe that freedom and security go together that the advance of human liberty can only strengthen the cause of world peace there is one sign the soviets can make that would be unmistakable that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace general secretary gorbachev if you seek peace if you seek prosperity for the soviet union and eastern europe if you seek liberalization come here to this gate mr gorbachev open this gate mr gorbachev tear down this wall in january gdr leader erich honecker predicted that the wall would stand for or more years if the conditions that had caused its construction did not change due to the increasing economic problems in the eastern bloc and the failure of the ussr to intervene in relation to the individual communist states the brackets of the eastern bloc slowly began to loosen from the end of the s one example is the fall of the communist government in neighboring poland s polish legislative election also in june the hungarian government began dismantling the electrified fence along its border with austria with western tv crews present although the border was still very closely guarded and escape was almost impossible the opening of a border gate between austria and hungary at the pan european picnic on august which was based on an idea by otto von habsburg to test the reaction of mikhail gorbachev then triggered a peaceful chain reaction at the end of which there was no longer the gdr and the eastern bloc had disintegrated because with the non reaction of the ussr and the gdr to the mass exodus the media informed eastern europeans could feel the increasing loss of power of their governments and more and more east germans were now trying to flee via hungary erich honecker explained to the daily mirror regarding the paneuropean picnic and thus showed his people his own inaction habsburg distributed leaflets far into poland on which the east german holidaymakers were invited to a picnic when they came to the picnic they were given gifts food and deutsche mark and then they were persuaded to come to the west then in september more than east german tourists escaped through hungary to austria this set up a chain of events the hungarians prevented many more east germans from crossing the border and returned them to budapest these east germans flooded the west german embassy and refused to return to east germany the east german government responded by disallowing any further travel to hungary but allowed those already there to return to east germany this triggered similar events in neighboring czechoslovakia this time however the east german authorities allowed people to leave provided that they did so by train through east germany this was followed by mass demonstrations within east germany itself protest demonstrations spread throughout east germany in september initially protesters were mostly people wanting to leave to the west chanting wir wollen raus we want out then protestors began to chant wir bleiben hier we are staying here this was the start of what east germans generally call the peaceful revolution of late the protest demonstrations grew considerably by early november the movement neared its height on november when half a million people gathered to demand political change at the alexanderplatz demonstration east berlin s large public square and transportation hub on october the police and army units were given permission to use force against those assembled but this did not deter the church service and march from taking place which gathered people the longtime leader of east germany erich honecker resigned on october and was replaced by egon krenz that day the wave of refugees leaving east germany for the west kept increasing by early november refugees were finding their way to hungary via czechoslovakia or via the west german embassy in prague this was tolerated by the new krenz government because of long standing agreements with the communist czechoslovak government allowing free travel across their common border however this movement of people grew so large it caused difficulties for both countries to ease the difficulties the politburo led by krenz decided on november to allow refugees to exit directly through crossing points between east germany and west germany including between east and west berlin later the same day the ministerial administration modified the proposal to include private round trip and travel the new regulations were to take effect the next day g nter schabowski the party boss in east berlin and the spokesman for the sed politburo had the task of announcing the new regulations however he had not been involved in the discussions about the new regulations and had not been fully updated shortly before a press conference on november he was handed a note announcing the changes but given no further instructions on how to handle the information these regulations had only been completed a few hours earlier and were to take effect the following day so as to allow time to inform the border guards but this starting time delay was not communicated to schabowski page needed at the end of the press conference schabowski read out loud the note he had been given a reporter ansa s riccardo ehrman asked when the regulations would take effect after a few seconds hesitation schabowski replied as far as i know it takes effect immediately without delay page needed after further questions from journalists he confirmed that the regulations included the border crossings through the wall into west berlin which he had not mentioned until then he repeated that it was immediate in an interview with american journalist tom brokaw excerpts from schabowski s press conference were the lead story on west germany s two main news programs that night at p m on zdf s heute and at p m on ard s tagesschau as ard and zdf had broadcast to nearly all of east germany since the late s and had become accepted by the east german authorities the news was broadcast there as well simultaneously later that night on ard s tagesthemen anchorman hanns joachim friedrichs proclaimed this november is a historic day the gdr has announced that starting immediately its borders are open to everyone the gates in the wall stand open wide page needed after hearing the broadcast east germans began gathering at the wall at the six checkpoints between east and west berlin demanding that border guards immediately open the gates the surprised and overwhelmed guards made many hectic telephone calls to their superiors about the problem at first they were ordered to find the more aggressive people gathered at the gates and stamp their passports with a special stamp that barred them from returning to east germany in effect revoking their citizenship however this still left thousands of people demanding to be let through as schabowski said we can page needed it soon became clear that no one among the east german authorities would take personal responsibility for issuing orders to use lethal force so the vastly outnumbered soldiers had no way to hold back the huge crowd of east german citizens finally at p m on november harald j ger the commander of the bornholmer stra e border crossing yielded allowing for the guards to open the checkpoints and allowing people through with little or no identity checking as the ossis swarmed through they were greeted by wessis waiting with flowers and champagne amid wild rejoicing soon afterward a crowd of west berliners jumped on top of the wall and were soon joined by east german youngsters the evening of november is known as the night the wall came down another border crossing to the south may have been opened earlier an account by heinz sch fer indicates that he also acted independently and ordered the opening of the gate at waltersdorf rudow a couple of hours earlier this may explain reports of east berliners appearing in west berlin earlier than the opening of the bornholmer stra e border crossing thirty years after the fall of the berlin wall the guardian collected short stories from november by five german writers who reflect on the day in this kathrin schmidt remembers comically i downed almost an entire bottle of schnapps remains of the wall adjacent to the topography of terror august a memorial of over a thousand crosses and a segment of the wall for those who died trying to cross the memorial stood for ten months in and before it was removed a berliner mauer plaque near checkpoint charlie signifying where the wall stood display of two sections of the wall and a you are leaving

exhibition dedicated to the th anniversary to the berlin wall destruction was located at potsdamer platz arkaden a hole in the berlin wall little is left of the wall at its original site which was destroyed almost in its entirety three long sections are still standing an metre long ft piece of the first westernmost wall at the topography of terror site of the former gestapo headquarters halfway between checkpoint charlie and potsdamer platz a longer section of the second easternmost wall along the spree river near the oberbaumbr cke nicknamed east side gallery and a third section that is partly reconstructed in the north at bernauer stra e which was turned into a memorial in other isolated fragments lampposts other elements and a few watchtowers also remain in various parts of the city nothing still accurately represents the wall s original appearance better than a very short stretch at bernauer stra e associated with the berlin wall documentation center other remnants are badly damaged by souvenir seekers fragments of the wall were taken and some were sold around the world appearing both with and without certificates of authenticity these fragments are now a staple on the online auction service ebay as well as german souvenir shops today the eastern side is covered in graffiti that did not exist while the wall was guarded by the armed soldiers of east germany previously graffiti appeared only on the western side along some tourist areas of the city centre the city government has marked the location of the former wall by a row of cobblestones in the street in most places only the first wall is marked except near potsdamer platz where the stretch of both walls is marked giving visitors an impression of the dimension of the barrier system citation needed after the fall of the berlin wall there were initiatives that they want to preserve the death strip walkways and redevelop them into a hiking and cycling area known as berliner mauerweg it is part of the initiative by the berlin senate since october for many years after reunification people in germany talked about cultural differences between east and west germans colloquially ossis and wessis sometimes described as mauer im kopf the wall in the head a september poll found that percent of west germans and percent of east germans wished that east and west should be separated again by a wall a poll taken in october on the occasion of the th anniversary of the fall of the wall indicated however that only about a tenth of the population was still unhappy with the unification percent in the east percent in the west although differences are still perceived between east and west germans make similar distinctions between north and south a poll conducted by russia s vtsiom found that more than half of all russians do not know who built the berlin wall ten percent of people surveyed thought berlin residents built it themselves six percent said western powers built it and four percent thought it was a bilateral initiative of the soviet union and the west fifty eight percent said they did not know who built it with just percent correctly naming the soviet union and its then communist ally east germany not all segments of the wall were ground up as the wall was being torn down many segments have been given to various institutions in the world they can be found for instance in presidential and historical museums lobbies of hotels and corporations at universities and government buildings and in public spaces in different countries of the world on august germany

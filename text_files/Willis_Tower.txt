 the willis tower originally the sears tower is a story foot m skyscraper in the loop community area of chicago in illinois united states designed by architect bruce graham and engineer fazlur rahman khan of skidmore owings merrill som it opened in as the world s tallest building a title that it held for nearly years it is currently the third tallest building in the western hemisphere as well as the rd tallest in the world each year more than million people visit the skydeck observation deck the highest in the united states making it one of chicago s most popular tourist destinations the building occupies a site bounded by franklin street jackson boulevard wacker drive and adams street graham and khan designed the building as nine square tubes clustered in a matrix seven of the tubes set back at upper floors the tower has stories as counted by standard methods though the building s owners count the main roof as and the mechanical penthouse roof as the facade is made of anodized aluminum and black glass the base of the building contains a retail complex known as the catalog the lower half of the tower was originally occupied by retail company sears which had its headquarters there until while the upper stories were rented out the structure was known as the sears tower from its construction until the naming rights were included in a lease with the willis group local area residents still refer to the building by its old name as of april update the building s largest tenant is united airlines which occupies around floors other major tenants include the building s namesake willis towers watson and law firms schiff hardin and seyfarth shaw morgan stanley became the building s fourth largest tenant in sears roebuck co had occupied an office complex on chicago s west side since the existing offices were inadequate by prompting sears executives to begin searching for a new site by sears was the largest retailer in the world with about employees sears executives quickly determined that a new headquarters complex in the suburbs was infeasible since it would require relocating about employees instead sears executives decided to consolidate the thousands of employees in offices distributed throughout the chicago area into one building on the western edge of chicago s loop sears asked its outside counsel arnstein gluck weitzenfeld minow now known as arnstein lehr llp to suggest a location the firm consulted with local and federal authorities and the applicable law then offered sears two options the first option was the goose island area northwest of the loop but sears s vice president of real estate matthew j stacom rejected this proposal the other was a two block area in the loop bounded by franklin street on the east jackson boulevard on the south wacker drive on the west and adams street on the north though the site was more centrally located it was also relatively small with about square feet m bernard feinberg albert i rubenstein and philip teinowitz had assembled that site over the previous five years but they had failed to acquire a neighboring square foot m lot from bus company greyhound lines feinberg rubenstein and teinowitz then bought options for three adjacent lots under the terms of each option unless the three men were able to acquire at least one of the lots within days all three options would be forfeited ultimately sears acquired the loop site in sears then obtained permits to close down one block of quincy street which bisected the site from east to west attorneys from the arnstein firm headed by andrew adsit began buying the properties parcel by parcel sears purchased buildings from owners and paid the government of chicago million for the block of quincy street that was to be closed down sears executives estimated that their new building would need about million square feet m split into stories with square feet m each or stories with square feet m each sears commissioned architecture firm skidmore owings merrill som to design the tower sears planned to move its merchandise group into the building initially renting out the remaining space to other tenants until needed sears executives were accustomed to large floor areas of at least square feet m but som architects raised concerns that the large floors would be unattractive to smaller tenants a subsequent proposal called for two buildings connected by a footbridge which would respectively contain square feet m and square feet m on each floor but this was also infeasible some floors were designed with smaller footprints to attract prospective lessees so the building s height was increased to meet sears s floor area requirements architect bruce graham and structural engineer fazlur rahman khan proposed a tower with square foot m floors in the lower part of the building as well as a series of setbacks with gradually tapering floor plates giving the tower its distinctive look during the design process one of the architects reportedly pulled out nine cigars and staggered them vertically until the pair both agreed to the arrangement this allowed sears to occupy the large lower stories while providing more conventional office space that could be rented out on the upper stories the firm of saphier lerner schindler was responsible for determining sears s space requirements and designing furniture for the company it conducted a year long study to determine how of the company s departments should be laid out within the building as sears continued to offer optimistic growth projections the height of the proposed tower also increased under chicago s relatively lax zoning laws the site could theoretically accommodate a story building with million square feet m in practice most potential tenants did not want excessively high offices additionally the federal aviation administration faa restricted the height of structures in the area to protect air traffic faa officials publicly denied that they had imposed a height limit however the area s minimum safe altitude would need to be raised by feet m if the building was just foot m taller plans for the tower were announced on july the foot tall m building would contain stories as measured from wacker drive and stories as measured from franklin street this would make sears s new tower the tallest in the world as measured by roof height although new york city s under construction world trade center twin towers would have a taller antenna although the sears tower would contain million square feet m of space only about million square feet m would be used as offices work on the building s foundation commenced in august contractors excavated the lot to a depth of feet m and they removed cubic feet m of dirt from the site by that november spencer white prentis inc was excavating a trench around the site measuring feet m deep and by feet by m across the contractors then built a slurry wall within the trench made of concrete and reinforced steel workers used steel bracing to prevent the slurry wall from collapsing inward then used caissons to drill holes into the ground they also rerouted a sewer that had run underneath quincy street which was to be closed permanent as part of the tower s construction the diesel construction company was hired as the sears tower s general contractor sears roebuck co chairman gordon m metcalf installed the building s first steel beam at a ceremony on june the project employed workers to accelerate the building s construction a concrete plant was built in the building s basement allowing workers to pour one third of a concrete floor every day contractors built two temporary kitchens on the site for workers and telephone and loudspeaker systems were installed on every floor to allow workers to communicate in addition contractors installed temporary generators that could supply up to kilowatts hp simultaneously during the winter most of this electricity was used to heat the exposed steel beams on the lowest five floors by late chicagoland residents and broadcasters had raised concerns that the new sears tower would disrupt television broadcasts according to one estimate the building would obstruct television signals for percent of chicagoans and cause double images for another percent primarily affecting communities to the northwest and southeast the same year officials of the village of skokie northwest of chicago threatened to request an injunction to prevent further construction in response to these concerns sears started researching methods to reduce the tower s effect on broadcast signals variety magazine stated that the sears tower did not interfere with broadcasts on its own since several shorter towers in the loop also interfered with broadcast signals nonetheless the illinois citizens committee for broadcasting filed a formal complaint with the federal communications commission fcc in february the first lawsuit against the building was filed by the state attorney in neighboring lake county on march a second suit was filed on march in cook county circuit court by the villages of skokie northbrook and deerfield illinois sears filed motions to dismiss the lake and cook county lawsuits which both sought to cap the building at stories sears studied the possibility of erecting antennas atop its tower in april and the tower s construction continued even as decisions on both lawsuits were delayed at the end of the month the company applied for permission to increase the building s height limit by feet m and install a new antenna although eight of chicago s ten television stations criticized the plan on may judge laverne dickson chief of the lake county circuit court dismissed the suit saying i find nothing that gives television viewers the right to reception without interference by then the building had reached the th story the lake county attorney appealed to the illinois supreme court in his decision on june judge charles r barrett contended the plaintiffs did not have a right to undistorted television reception meanwhile the fcc declined to act on the height dispute on the grounds it did not have jurisdiction the faa approved the antennas atop the tower in june and the illinois supreme court affirmed the previous rulings by lake and cook county circuit courts at the end of the month work was temporarily paused that july due to a labor strike the next month sears formally announced plans for broadcast antennas on the tower s roof and the company offered to spend million to help relocate broadcast stations to the sears tower the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit upheld the fcc s decision in september and the united states supreme court refused to hear an appeal of the seventh circuit s decision that november in november the sears tower became chicago s tallest building surpassing the standard oil building which had held the record for one month at the time the sears project employed workers in three shifts one worker had been killed during the project so far the building s final completion had been delayed significantly due to labor strikes and bad weather the concrete work had reached the th floor while the steel superstructure had reached the th floor the remainder of the steelwork would be difficult to construct because of high winds at higher altitudes local television stations wttw and wls tv were planning to install temporary broadcast antennas atop the tower when the steel frame was completed the tower s superstructure had reached the th floor in february at which point it was taller than the empire state building in new york city the building was topped out on may the day before the event the chicago tribune s editorial board wrote move aside new york after tomorrow when schoolchildren dream of big buildings they ll no longer think of you and the empire state building and the world trade center the frame was still not technically complete as three to four stories remained to be built one week after the ceremony four workers died after an elevator shaft caught fire a fifth worker died after falling from the tower in an unrelated incident four days later work was halted again that june due to a labor strike and sears began moving furniture into the building that month the construction cost was about us million equivalent to million in dollars despite the size of the project sears executives said the building could not accommodate sears annual shareholder meetings and the company continued to rent space in other structures the first sears employees began moving into the tower during the weekend of september flashing beacons on the building s roof the first to be installed at any building in chicago were activated the same month upon the tower s opening broadcasters at the john hancock center chicago s second tallest building had to decide whether to relocate to the sears tower two television stations decided to relocate six other stations remained at the john hancock center citing a study which showed that relocating to the sears tower would provide only minimal benefits documents released in late indicated that the sears tower would cause much more interference than either sears or the television stations had disclosed wls tv moved to the sears tower in february followed by wttw the next month by march three fourths of the space in the building was occupied sears had leased the upper stories to tenants such as goldman sachs northwest industries and schiff hardin a mobile sculpture by alexander calder was dedicated in the lobby in october sears optimistic growth projections were not realized instead in late the company fired workers about seven percent of the sears employees that worked in the tower competition beyond its traditional rivals such as montgomery ward arose from emerging retail giants including kmart kohl s and walmart as a result of a surplus of office space that emerged in the s the tower did not draw as many tenants as projected and so stood half vacant for a decade in february sears announced that it would renovate the building to attract visitors to the lower floors at the time sears employees occupied more than half of the building taking up the lowest stories the remainder of the tower was occupied by employees from about companies as part of the project the main entrance was covered with a four story glass dome and the first four stories were converted into a shopping atrium in addition a visitor center for the building s skydeck was constructed the renovations designed by som were completed in mid paul gapp of the chicago tribune wrote that som had scaled the new entrance skillfully in keeping with the main building s height and that the new atrium relieves the formerly cramped feeling from just inside the franklin entrance sears announced in that it would sell the tower and relocate its merchandising division from the lower half of the building the company wanted to earn at least billion from the sale of the sears tower so it offered multiple concessions to potential buyers including a guarantee that sears would continue to pay rent on the lower half of the building until tenants were found for these stories four large firms were negotiating to buy the tower by july the company had difficulties finding a buyer in part because the lower stories were too large for many potential tenants sears nearly sold the tower to canadian company olympia york but the deal was canceled in september because the two firms could not agree on who would pay the property taxes in november sears decided to instead refinance the building the next year sears took out a mortgage loan on the tower for million from metlife and aew capital management with metlife as the holder of the mortgage note the loan would mature in in the law firm of keck mahin cate decided to move into a development that would become west wacker drive rebuffing sears attempts to entice the firm to stay just two years later sears began moving its own offices out of the building to a new campus in hoffman estates illinois which was completed in as the maturation of the mortgage approached sears renegotiated the loan in the negotiations resulted in an agreement where sears would no longer be liable for the million loan although it would only nominally own the building while aew and metlife effectively had total control as part of the agreement aew and metlife would be able to take official ownership of the building in in toronto based trizechahn at the time the lessee of the cn tower acquired aew s holdings in the building for million assuming million in liabilities and a million mortgage trizec had projected that the sears tower would quickly reach a value of billion these projections were not met with the tower facing the same vacancy and other problems it saw under sears although trizec made somewhat successful efforts to attract new tenants following the september attacks two of the largest tenants goldman sachs and merrill lynch immediately announced plans for vacating ft of space in trizec sold its holdings of the tower to metlife for million in march metlife announced that it would sell the building to a group of investors including joseph chetrit joseph moinian lloyd goldman joseph cayre and jeffrey feil of new york as well as american landmark properties of skokie illinois the quoted price was million with million held in a mortgage two years later in february the sears tower s owners obtained a million loan from ubs at the time ubs valued the tower at billion since the owners had considered plans for the construction of a hotel on the north side of jackson boulevard between wacker drive and franklin street close to the entrance of the observation deck above the tower s underground parking garage according to the tower s owners the second building was considered in the original design the plan was eventually cancelled as city zoning did not permit construction of such a tall building in that location in february the owners announced they were considering a plan to paint the structure silver an idea that was later abandoned it was hoped that a new silver paint job would rebrand the building and highlight its advances in energy efficiency for an estimated cost of million although sears naming rights expired in the building continued to be called the sears tower for several years despite multiple changes in ownership in march london based insurance broker willis group holdings agreed to lease a portion of the building and obtained the naming rights on july the building was officially renamed the willis tower by the building s owners were considering selling a partial ownership stake or even the entire building to an investor the next year united airlines announced it would move its corporate headquarters from west wacker drive to willis tower by march the willis tower was being marketed at a price of billion the same month the blackstone group purchased the tower for a reported billion the highest price ever paid for a property in the u s outside of new york city blackstone announced a million renovation in january which would include the construction of the catalog a six story commercial complex replacing a plaza on jackson boulevard and the entrance on wacker drive architectural firm gensler designed the renovation a rooftop terrace was built atop the catalog and the building s hvac systems were overhauled most of the building s elevators excluding those that served the skydeck were also renovated for the first time in the tower s history the new elevators would be faster than the original elevators and would use use percent less energy the building s owners installed artwork by olafur eliasson jacob hashimoto and other artists to fund these improvements in february blackstone obtained a billion loan from a group of banks including goldman sachs the new loan replaced million of cmbs debt that was maturing the following year because of the increasing costs of the renovation blackstone received a new billion loan from deutsche bank and barclays the wacker drive entrance was demolished in early to make way for the catalog a steel globe next to the entrance manufactured by the poblocki sign company and installed in was relocated to elmhurst illinois a square foot m private club on the th and th stories opened in june the club included a restaurant named craftsman and a lounge named frame both of which exclusively served the tower s tenants as well as a public restaurant known as the east room that september urbanspace announced that it would operate a food hall on the lower stories in insurance company aon had proposed acquiring willis towers watson which had succeeded the willis group as the building s owner prompting speculation that the building could be renamed again the planned merger was canceled in following an antitrust lawsuit from the united states department of justice the building s renovation was completed in may at the time although the willis tower was nearly percent leased the number of tenants and visitors entering the building had decreased significantly since in part because of the covid pandemic in chicago in june seven men were arrested by the fbi and charged with plotting to destroy the tower deputy fbi director john pistole described their plot as more aspirational than operational the case went to court in october after three trials five of the suspects were convicted and two acquitted the alleged leader of the group narseal batiste was sentenced to years in prison in response to the perceived threat of an attack the building s largest tenant at this time ernst young moved to north wacker drive in early in may heavy rains caused three of the basement levels to flood knocking out power to the building this also resulted in many tv and radio stations going off the air the willis tower was designed by architect bruce graham and structural engineer fazlur rahman khan of skidmore owings and merrill graham and khan designed the building as nine square tubes clustered in a matrix forming a square base with foot m sides the building s total area is sq ft m the structure was intended to accommodate employees each of the tubes is a column free module measuring by feet by m which set back at different stories there are setbacks at the th th and th floors the lowest stories contain nine tubes and cover square feet m each the northwest and southeast tubes terminate at the th floor the st through th floors each span square feet m above which the northeast and southwest tubes end from the th to th floors each story is shaped like a cross covering square feet m the north east and south tubes end at the th floor the remaining west and center tubes reach floors with an area of square feet m on each of the top stories the sears tower was the first building to use this innovative design it was both structurally efficient and economic at feet it provided more space and rose higher than the empire state building and cost much less per unit area the system would prove highly influential in skyscraper construction and has been used in most supertall buildings since including the world s current tallest building the burj khalifa in february two television antennas were added to the structure increasing its total height to feet m the western antenna was later extended bringing the overall height to feet m on june to improve reception of local nbc station wmaq tv the perimeter of the willis tower contains columns that are spaced feet m apart on their centers the facade is made of anodized aluminum and black glass alcoa manufactured million pounds kt of aluminum sheeting for the building s facade black bands appear on the tower around the th nd th th th th and th th floors these elements are louvers to ventilate the building s environmental support systems and obscure its belted trusses the rest of the facade is made of rectangular windows all of which measure by feet by m and are tinted with bronze outside the building there was originally a square foot m plaza made of pink granite in the late s a three level wing was built along the western and southern sides of the tower replacing the tower the roof garden above the annex spans square feet m the annex contains a facade of black steel and aluminum similar to in the original building the jackson boulevard facade of the annex contains an artwork by olafur eliasson entitled atmospheric wave wall the work measuring by feet by m across comprises almost blue and green steel tiles which are decorated with hexagonal motifs the wall is backlit at night the interior includes short tons long tons t of steel million pounds kt of aluminum and acres sq ft m of concrete flooring the building contains diagonal columns only on the two stories immediately below each of the setbacks thus reducing shear stress the interior of the building could not contain diagonal beams since these would have obstructed the connections between each of the tubes therefore the columns and the horizontal beams on each story are connected by rigid joints the superstructure was designed to withstand wind gusts of miles per hour km h which on average would occur once every hundred years according to the chicago tribune the top of the building would be able to bend by as much as inches mm returning to its normal position within seconds the willis tower s basement extends feet m deep resting on a foot thick m concrete slab the ground directly beneath the building was largely made of clay the underlying layer of limestone was as much as feet m beneath ground level as a result the foundation was excavated using caissons of which reached the underlying limestone the caissons created holes that measured up to feet m across some holes at the northwestern and northeastern corners of the site filled up with groundwater and had to be drained workers next placed steel tubes into the holes then poured concrete around the tubes during the sears tower s construction som and chicago government officials considered adding smoke free and fire free areas to the building as well as a complete sprinkler system serving all floors neither of these features had previously been used in a structure in chicago even though regulations did not require a fire sprinkler system the building was equipped with one from the beginning there are around sprinkler heads in the building installed at a cost of million when it was completed the sears tower was heated electrically unlike older structures that used gas heating it included light fixtures and a cooling system capable of tons of refrigeration furthermore the tower contained fire suppression and communications systems for emergency use which were powered by diesel generators if there was a fire in one section of the building the building s smoke detection system would close off the fresh air intake openings in that section discharging smoke outdoors fifteen above ground stories as well as three of the basement levels contain mechanical equipment above the skydeck on the rd floor is a seven story mechanical penthouse the sears tower was planned with elevators including double deck elevators the office stories are served by elevator cabs due to the presence of the double deck elevators these occupy shafts as designed one bank of single deck elevators connected the lobby to the lowest stories banks of double deck elevators traveled to sky lobbies at the rd th and th th floors where passengers could transfer to local elevators the th through rd stories were served by local elevators that operated from the sky lobbies two elevators also ran directly from the lobby to the skydeck on the rd floor as of update the elevators carried million passengers per year six of the elevators are used for freight one of the freight elevators served all stories traveling to a height of feet m during a fire or another emergency this elevator would be reserved for the chicago fire department other elevators would be controlled from the rd floor during a fire elevators would be dispatched to the affected floors to assist with evacuation the building also had escalators including a set of double height escalators that traveled from the main lobby to the lower mezzanine another set of escalators connects the rd and th stories when the building was completed the main entrance was on wacker drive to the west there was a plaza on the south side of the building sloping upward toward franklin street to the east the franklin street side of the building was feet m lower than the wacker drive entrance so the entrances on franklin street were actually below the plaza leading to the building s lower mezzanine below ground level are three basement levels with a total area of square feet m the basements included a seat cafeteria commercial space service areas and a loading dock for trucks the basement also contained a spot parking garage as of update the building s base covers square feet m and contains two lobbies for tenants the building s tenants primarily enter from wacker drive and franklin street shoppers restaurant patrons and visitors to the skydeck observation deck use the southern entrance on jackson boulevard the wacker drive lobby contains in the heart of this infinite particle of galactic dust a artwork by jacob hashimoto it consists of over rice paper and resin disks that are hung from the ceiling to honor khan s contributions to skyscraper engineering design the structural engineers association of illinois also commissioned a sculpture of him for the lobby of the willis tower the commercial complex at the building s lowest stories is known as the catalog a reference to sears mail order catalogs the six story complex includes numerous restaurants it extends into three of the building s basement levels as well as the three story annex to the south and west of the tower the roof of the annex includes a curved skylight with glass panes and the northern section of the annex s roof is supported by black columns that resemble those in the original tower the catalog also contains decorative details such as handrails and staircase landings which are inspired by elements of chicago s built environment the third story of the catalog contains a square foot coworking space operated by convene the willis tower observation deck called the skydeck opened on june located on the rd floor feet m above ground level it is the highest observation deck in the united states and one of chicago s most famous tourist attractions tourists can experience how the building sways in wind and see far over the plains of illinois and across lake michigan to indiana michigan and wisconsin in clear conditions elevators reach the top in about seconds allowing occupants to feel the change in pressure as they ascend the skydeck competes with the john hancock center s observation floor a mile and a half away but reaching feet m lower some million tourists visit annually a second observation deck on the th floor serves as a backup in january a major renovation of the skydeck began including the installation of retractable glass balconies which extend approximately feet m from the facade of the rd floor overlooking south wacker drive the all glass boxes informally dubbed the ledge allow visitors to see the street below the boxes which can accommodate short tons metric tons opened to the public on july on may the laminated glass flooring of one of the boxes cracked while visitors were inside but there were no injuries the flooring of the same box cracked again on june in may a fifth glass ledge opened on the west facade overlooking south wacker drive when completed the sears tower was the world s tallest building but not the world s tallest structure toronto s cn tower was about feet m taller although the council on tall buildings and urban habitat ctbuh does not consider the cn tower to be a building since it does not have floors from the ground up the willis tower remains the third tallest building in the americas and in the western hemisphere after one world trade center and central park tower in new york city with a pinnacle height of feet m it is the third tallest freestanding structure in the americas it is the th tallest freestanding structure in the world by pinnacle height when the petronas twin towers in kuala lumpur malaysia was completed in it claimed to be the tallest building in the world measuring feet m tall including decorative spires chicagoans objected to this claim on the basis that the sears tower s top floor was higher than that of either of the petronas towers in the ensuing controversy four categories of tallest building were created of these petronas was the tallest in the category of height to the top of architectural elements meaning spires but not antennas taipei in taiwan claimed the record in three of the four categories in surpassing the petronas twin towers in spire height and the sears tower in roof height and highest occupied floor people suggested that sears add cosmetics atop its tower to surpass taipei but this did not materialize on august the burj khalifa in dubai was reported by its developers to have surpassed the tower in all height categories upon completion one world trade center in new york city surpassed the willis tower through its structural and pinnacle heights but not by roof observation deck elevation or highest occupied floor until the tower did not hold the record for being the tallest building by pinnacle height from to this record was held by john hancock center whose antenna reached a height of feet m feet m taller than the sears tower s original height one world trade center became taller by pinnacle height with the addition of a foot meter antenna bringing its total height to feet m in two antennas were installed which brought its total height to feet m making it taller than the john hancock center but not one world trade center however the extension of the tower s western antenna in june to feet m allowed it to just barely claim the title of tallest building by pinnacle height the lowest level of willis tower is feet m below the elevation of franklin street on may dan goodwin wearing a homemade spider man suit while using suction cups camming devices and sky hooks and despite several attempts by the chicago fire department to stop him made the first successful outside ascent of the tower goodwin was arrested at the top after the seven hour climb and was later charged with trespassing goodwin stated that the reason he made the climb was to call attention to shortcomings in high rise rescue and firefighting techniques after a lengthy interrogation by chicago s district attorney and fire commissioner goodwin was officially released from jail in august french urban climber alain spiderman robert using only his bare hands and bare feet scaled the building s exterior glass and steel wall all the way to the top a thick fog settled in near the end of his climb making the last stories of the building s glass and steel exterior slippery annually since the willis tower has hosted skyrise chicago the world s tallest indoor stair climb as a charity event benefiting shirley ryan abilitylab where participants can legally climb the willis tower s story staircase sears sold the tower in and vacated it by but retained naming rights through the new owners were rebuffed in renaming deals with cdw corp in and the u s olympic committee in british insurance broker willis group holdings leased more than square feet m of space on three floors in a willis spokesman said the naming rights were obtained as part of the negotiations at no cost to willis and the building was renamed willis tower on july the naming rights are valid for years so it is possible that the building s name could change again as soon as the chicago tribune joked that the building s new name reminded them of the oft repeated what you talkin bout willis catchphrase from the american television sitcom diff rent strokes and considered the name change ill advised in a city with a deep appreciation of tradition and a healthy ego where some chicagoans still mourn the switch from marshall field s to macy s this feeling was confirmed in a july cnn article in which some chicago area residents expressed reluctance to accept the willis tower name and in an article that appeared in the october issue of chicago magazine that ranked the building among chicago s most important the author pointedly refused to acknowledge the name change and referred to the building as the sears tower time magazine called the name change one of the top worst corporate name changes and pointed to negative press coverage by local news outlets and online petitions from angry residents the naming rights issue continued into when eric zorn noted in the chicago tribune that we re stubborn about such things this month marked four years since the former sears tower was re christened willis tower and the new name has yet to stick many broadcast station transmitters are located at the top of willis tower each list is ranked by height from the top down stations at the same height on the same mast indicate the use of a diplexer into the same shared antenna due to its extreme height fm stations all class b are very limited in power output noaa weather radio station kwo transmits off the tower at mhz programmed by the national weather service weather forecast office in chicago it is equipped with specific area message encoding same which sets off a siren on specially programmed weather radios to alert of an impending hazard the building has appeared in numerous films and television shows set in chicago such as ferris bueller s day off where ferris and company visit the observation deck late night with conan o brien introduced a character called the sears tower dressed in sears clothing when the show visited chicago in the building is also featured in history channel s life after people in which it and other human made landmarks suffer from neglect without humans around collapsing two hundred years after people are gone in the film the dark knight it is part of gotham city in the film transformers dark of the moon it is featured in a number of scenes in the film man of steel the tower is the location of the offices of the daily planet

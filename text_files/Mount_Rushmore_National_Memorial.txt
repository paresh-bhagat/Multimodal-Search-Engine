 mount rushmore national memorial is a national memorial centered on a colossal sculpture carved into the granite face of mount rushmore lakota t u k ila kpe or six grandfathers in the black hills near keystone south dakota united states sculptor gutzon borglum created the sculpture s design and oversaw the project s execution from to with the help of his son lincoln borglum the sculpture features the foot tall m heads of four united states presidents recommended by borglum george washington thomas jefferson theodore roosevelt and abraham lincoln the four presidents were chosen to represent the nation s birth growth development and preservation respectively the memorial park covers acres sq mi km and the mountain itself has an elevation of feet m above sea level the sculptor and tribal representatives settled on mount rushmore clarification needed which also has the advantage of facing southeast for maximum sun exposure doane robinson wanted it to feature american west heroes such as lewis and clark their expedition guide sacagawea oglala lakota chief red cloud buffalo bill cody and oglala lakota chief crazy horse borglum believed that the sculpture should have broader appeal and chose the four presidents peter norbeck u s senator from south dakota sponsored the project and secured federal funding construction began in and the presidents faces were completed between and after gutzon borglum died in march his son lincoln took over as leader of the construction project each president was originally to be depicted from head to waist but lack of funding forced construction to end on october sometimes referred to as the shrine of democracy mount rushmore attracts more than two million visitors annually mount rushmore was conceived with the intention of creating a site to lure tourists representing not only the wild grandeur of its local geography but also the triumph of western civilization over that geography through its anthropomorphic representation though for the latest occupants of the land at the time the lakota sioux as well as other tribes the monument in their view came to epitomize the loss of their sacred lands and the injustices they ve suffered under the u s government under the treaty of the u s government promised the territory including the entirety of the black hills to the sioux so long as the buffalo may range thereon in such numbers as to justify the chase after the discovery of gold on the land american settlers migrated to the area in the s the federal government then forced the sioux to relinquish the black hills portion of their reservation the four presidential faces were said to be carved into the granite with the intention of symbolizing an accomplishment born planned and created in the minds and by the hands of americans for americans mount rushmore is known to the lakota sioux as the six grandfathers t u k ila kpe or cougar mountain igm t a ka pah but american settlers knew it variously as cougar mountain sugarloaf mountain slaughterhouse mountain and keystone cliffs as six grandfathers the mountain was on the route that lakota leader black elk took in a spiritual journey that culminated at black elk peak following a series of military campaigns from to the united states asserted control over the area a claim that is still disputed on the basis of the treaty of fort laramie beginning with a prospecting expedition in with david swanzey husband of carrie ingalls and bill challis wealthy investor charles e rushmore began visiting the area regularly on prospecting and hunting trips he repeatedly joked with colleagues about naming the mountain after himself the united states board of geographic names officially recognized the name mount rushmore in june historian doane robinson conceived the idea for mount rushmore in to promote tourism in south dakota in robinson persuaded sculptor gutzon borglum to travel to the black hills region to ensure the carving could be accomplished the original plan was to make the carvings in granite pillars known as the needles however borglum realized that the eroded needles were too thin to support sculpting he chose mount rushmore a grander location partly because it faced southeast and enjoyed maximum exposure to the sun borglum said upon seeing mount rushmore america will march along that skyline borglum had been involved in sculpting the stone mountain memorial to confederate leaders in georgia but was in disagreement with the officials there u s senator peter norbeck and congressman william williamson of south dakota introduced bills in early for permission to use federal land which passed easily south dakota legislation had less support only passing narrowly on its third attempt which governor carl gunderson signed into law on march private funding came slowly and borglum invited president calvin coolidge to an august dedication ceremony at which he promised federal funding congress passed the mount rushmore national memorial act signed by coolidge which authorized up to in matching funds the presidential transition to herbert hoover delayed funding until an initial federal match of was acquired carving started in and ended in with no fatalities between october and october gutzon borglum and workers sculpted the colossal foot high m carvings of united states presidents george washington thomas jefferson theodore roosevelt and abraham lincoln to represent the first years of american history these presidents were selected by borglum because of their role in preserving the republic and expanding its territory the carving of mount rushmore involved the use of dynamite followed by the process of honeycombing a process where workers drill holes close together allowing small pieces to be removed by hand in total about short tons t of rock were blasted off the mountainside the image of thomas jefferson was originally intended to appear in the area at washington s right but after the work there was begun the rock was found to be unsuitable so the work on the jefferson figure was dynamited and a new figure was sculpted to washington s left the chief carver of the mountain was luigi del bianco an artisan and stonemason in port chester new york del bianco emigrated to the u s from friuli in italy and was chosen to work on this project because of his understanding of sculptural language and ability to imbue emotion in the carved portraits in the national park service took mount rushmore under its jurisdiction julian spotts helped with the project by improving its infrastructure for example he had the tram upgraded so it could reach the top of mount rushmore for the ease of workers by july washington s face had been completed and was dedicated the face of thomas jefferson was dedicated in and the face of abraham lincoln was dedicated on september in a bill was introduced in congress to add the head of civil rights leader susan b anthony but a rider was passed on an appropriations bill requiring federal funds be used to finish only those heads that had already been started at that time in the face of theodore roosevelt was dedicated the sculptor s studio a display of unique plaster models and tools related to the sculpting was built in under the direction of borglum borglum died from an embolism in march his son lincoln borglum continued the project originally it was planned that the figures would be carved from head to waist but insufficient funding forced the carving to end borglum had also planned a massive panel in the shape of the louisiana purchase commemorating in eight foot tall gilded letters the declaration of independence u s constitution louisiana purchase and seven other territorial acquisitions from the alaska purchase to the panama canal zone in total the entire project cost us equivalent to million in nick clifford the last remaining carver died in november at age harold spitznagel and cecil doty designed the original visitor center finished in these structures were part of the mission effort to improve visitors facilities at national parks and monuments across the country ten years of redevelopment work culminated with the completion of extensive visitor facilities and sidewalks in such as a visitor center the lincoln borglum museum and the presidential trail maintenance of the memorial requires mountain climbers to monitor and seal cracks annually due to budget constraints the memorial is not regularly cleaned to remove lichens however on july alfred k rcher a german manufacturer of pressure washing and steam cleaning machines conducted a free cleanup operation which lasted several weeks using pressurized water at over f c on october mount rushmore was listed on the national register of historic places a word essay giving the history of the united states by nebraska student william andrew burkett was selected as the college age group winner in a competition and that essay was placed on the entablature on a bronze plate in in president george h w bush officially dedicated mount rushmore in when the sculpture was not yet complete a bill in congress supporting the addition of women s rights activist susan b anthony failed when the sculpture was completed in the sculptors said that the remaining rock was not suitable for additional carvings this stance was shared by respec an engineering firm charged with monitoring the stability of the rock in however proposals of additional sculptures have been made regardless these include john f kennedy after his assassination in and ronald reagan in and the latter proposal receiving a debate in congress at the time barack obama was asked about his own potential addition in and he joked that his ears were too large donald trump has on occasion expressed interest in his own addition to the mountain during a rally in ohio he said i d ask whether or not you some day think i will be on mount rushmore if i did it joking totally joking having fun the fake news media will say he believes he should be on mount rushmore so i won t say it by the account of south dakota governor kristi noem trump described the potential addition as his dream in conversation in august it was alleged that the previous year white house aides working for president donald trump made contact with noem the previous year about the process of adding additional presidents including trump to the monument trump denied the accusation on his official twitter account saying he never suggested it although based on all of the many things accomplished during the first years perhaps more than any other presidency sounds like a good idea to me according to a survey of political science experts conducted by the new york times in franklin d roosevelt was the most popular choice for addition to mount rushmore regardless of party affiliation in total of respondents would choose roosevelt followed by barack obama at and ronald reagan at among democrats roosevelt was chosen by followed by obama at among republicans roosevelt was chosen by followed by reagan at among independents roosevelt was chosen by followed by both reagan and dwight d eisenhower at tourism is south dakota s second largest industry and mount rushmore is the state s top tourist attraction people visited the park in the popularity of the location as with many other national monuments derives from its immediate recognizability there are no substitutes for iconic resources such as the statue of liberty the lincoln memorial or mount rushmore these locations are one of a kind places however mount rushmore also provides access to a surrounding environment of wilderness which distinguishes it from the typical proximity of national monuments to urban centers like washington d c and new york city in the s and s local lakota sioux elder benjamin black elk son of medicine man black elk who had been present at the battle of the little bighorn was known as the fifth face of mount rushmore posing for photographs with thousands of tourists daily in his native attire the south dakota state historical society notes that he was one of the most photographed people in the world over that year period borglum originally envisioned a grand hall of records where america s greatest historical documents and artifacts could be protected and shown to tourists he managed to start the project but cut only feet m into the rock before work stopped in to focus on the faces in an effort to complete borglum s vision resulted in a repository being constructed inside the mouth of the cave housing enamel panels that contained biographical and historical information about mount rushmore as well as the texts of the documents borglum wanted to preserve there the vault consists of a teakwood box housing the panels inside of a titanium vault placed in the ground with a granite capstone the text found on the panels can be found below the ongoing conservation of the site is overseen by the national park service physical efforts to conserve the monument have included replacement of the sealant applied originally to cracks in the stone by gutzon borglum which had proved ineffective at providing water resistance the components of borglum s sealant included linseed oil granite dust and white lead but a modern silicone replacement for the cracks is now used disguised with granite dust in electronic monitoring devices were installed to track movement in the topology of the sculpture to an accuracy of three millimeters the site was digitally recorded in using a terrestrial laser scanning method as part of the international scottish ten project providing a high resolution record to aid the conservation of the site this data was made publicly accessible online the flora and fauna of mount rushmore are similar to those of the rest of the black hills region of south dakota birds including the turkey vulture golden eagle bald eagle red tailed hawk swallows and white throated swifts fly around mount rushmore occasionally making nesting spots in the ledges of the mountain smaller birds including songbirds nuthatches woodpeckers and flycatchers inhabit the surrounding pine forests terrestrial mammals include the mouse least chipmunk red squirrel skunk porcupine raccoon beaver badger coyote bighorn sheep bobcat elk mule deer yellow bellied marmot and american bison the striped chorus frog western chorus frog and northern leopard frog also inhabit the area along with several species of snake grizzly bear brook and starling basin brook the two streams in the memorial support fish such as the longnose dace and the brook trout citation needed mountain goats are not indigenous to the region those living near mount rushmore are descendants of a tribe that canada gifted to custer state park in which later escaped at lower elevations coniferous trees mainly the ponderosa pine surround most of the monument providing shade from the sun other trees include the bur oak the black hills spruce and the cottonwood nine species of shrubs grow near mount rushmore there is also a wide variety of wildflowers including especially the snapdragon sunflower and violet towards higher elevations plant life becomes sparser however only approximately five percent of the plant species found in the black hills are indigenous to the region the area receives about inches mm of precipitation on average per year enough to support abundant animal and plant life trees and other plants help to control surface runoff dikes seeps and springs help to dam up water that is flowing downhill providing watering spots for animals in addition stones like sandstone and limestone help to hold groundwater creating aquifers a investigation by the u s geological survey found unusually high concentrations of perchlorate in the surface water and groundwater of the area a sample collected from a stream had a maximum perchlorate concentration of micrograms per liter roughly times higher than samples taken from locations outside the area the report concluded the probable cause of the contamination was the aerial fireworks displays that had taken place on independence days from to the national park service also reported that at least forest fires around mount rushmore in that same period to have been caused by fireworks displays a study of the fire scars present in tree ring samples indicates that forest fires occur in the ponderosa forests surrounding mount rushmore around every years large fires are not common most events have been ground fires that serve to clear forest debris the area is a climax community recent when pine beetle infestations have threatened the forest mount rushmore is largely composed of granite the memorial is carved on the northwest margin of the black elk peak granite batholith in the black hills of south dakota so the geologic formations of the heart of the black hills region are also evident at mount rushmore the batholith magma intruded into the pre existing mica schist rocks during the proterozoic billion years ago coarse grained pegmatite dikes are associated with the granite intrusion of black elk peak and are visibly lighter in color thus explaining the light colored streaks on the foreheads of the presidents citation needed the black hills granites were exposed to erosion during the neoproterozoic but were later buried by sandstone and other sediments during the cambrian remaining buried throughout the paleozoic they were re exposed again during the laramide orogeny around million years ago the black hills area was uplifted as an elongated geologic dome subsequent erosion stripped the granite of the overlying sediments and the softer adjacent schist some schist does remain and can be seen as the darker material just below the sculpture of washington citation needed the tallest mountain in the region is black elk peak ft or m borglum selected mount rushmore as the site for several reasons the rock of the mountain is composed of smooth fine grained granite the durable granite erodes only inch mm every years thus was more than sturdy enough to support the sculpture and its long term exposure the mountain s height of feet m above sea level made it suitable and because it faces the southeast the workers also had the advantage of sunlight for most of the day it is not possible to add another president to the memorial because the rock that surrounds the existing faces is not suitable for additional carving and because if additional sculpting work were done that might create instabilities in the existing carvings the mount rushmore area is underlain by well drained alfisol soils of very gravelly loam mocmount to silt loam buska texture brown to dark grayish brown mount rushmore has a dry winter humid continental climate dwb in the k ppen climate classification it is inside a usda plant hardiness zone of a meaning certain plant life in the area can withstand a low temperature of no less than f c the two wettest months of the year are may and june orographic lift causes brief but strong afternoon thunderstorms during the summer mount rushmore has been depicted in multiple films comic books and television series its functions vary from settings for action scenes to the site of hidden locations its most famous appearance is as the location of the final chase scene in the film north by northwest it is used as a secret base of operations by the protagonists in the film team america world police and the secret underground city of c bola is located there in the film national treasure book of secrets in some films the presidential faces are replaced with others examples include the film superman ii and the film mars attacks where the villains add their faces to the monument and the film head of state where the newly elected president s face is added in works showing attacks on landmarks to signify the scope of a threat mount rushmore is a common target examples include the aforementioned facial replacements in superman ii and mars attacks as well as natural disasters in works like the miniseries apocalypse and terrorist attacks as in the film the peacekeeper an atypical representation of the monument appears in the film nebraska where instead of being treated with reverence it is criticized for being unfinished the treaty of fort laramie had granted the black hills to the lakota people in perpetuity but the united states took the area from the tribe after the great sioux war of members of the american indian movement led an occupation of the monument in naming it mount crazy horse and lakota holy man john fire lame deer planted a prayer staff on top of the mountain lame deer said that the staff formed a symbolic shroud over the presidents faces which shall remain dirty until the treaties concerning the black hills are fulfilled construction on the crazy horse memorial began in elsewhere in the black hills ostensibly to commemorate the native american leader and as a response to mount rushmore if completed it would be larger than mount rushmore the crazy horse memorial foundation has rejected offers of federal funds its construction has the support of some lakota chiefs but it is the subject of controversy even among native american tribes the united states supreme court decision united states v sioux nation of indians ruled that the sioux had not received just compensation for their land in the black hills which includes mount rushmore the court proposed million as compensation for the loss of the black hills this compensation was valued at billion in and with accumulated interest nearly billion in in oglala lakota nation citizen and indigenous activist nick tilsen explained that his people would not accept a settlement because we won t settle for anything less than the full return of our lands as stipulated by the treaties our nations signed and agreed upon in gerard baker was appointed superintendent of the park the first and so far only native american in that role baker stated that he will open up more avenues of interpretation and that the four presidents are only one avenue and only one focus on july scores of activists demonstrated when president donald trump held a campaign rally at mount rushmore the foremost message was that indigenous people want their land back pursuant to the ongoing dispute of the black hills land claim twenty people were arrested on august the u s post office issued the mount rushmore memorial cent commemorative stamp on the th anniversary of the dedication of the mount rushmore national memorial on january a cent airmail stamp depicting the monument was also issued in the united states mint released commemorative silver dollar half dollar and five dollar coins celebrating the th anniversary of the monument s dedication and the sculpture was the main subject of the south dakota state quarter in music american composer michael daugherty s piece for chorus and orchestra mount rushmore depicts each of the four presidents in separate movements the piece sets texts by george washington william billings thomas jefferson maria cosway theodore roosevelt and abraham lincoln by contrast the song little snakes by protest the hero addresses the violent colonial history involved in the sculpting of mount rushmore critiquing the monument as a symbol of colonialism referencing the genocide of indigenous peoples and the ownership of slaves by george washington and thomas jefferson the washington nationals baseball club uses large foam rubber depictions of the rushmore four in both their marketing campaigns and in a series of in stadium promotions such as the presidents race

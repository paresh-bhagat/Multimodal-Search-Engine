 the guantanamo bay detention camp spanish centro de detenci n de la bah a de guant namo is a united states military prison located within guantanamo bay naval base also referred to as guant namo gtmo and gitmo tmo on the coast of guant namo bay in cuba of the roughly people detained there since january when the military prison first opened after the september attacks have been transferred elsewhere remain there and have died while in custody the camp was established by u s president george w bush s administration in during the war on terror following the september attacks indefinite detention without trial led the operations of this camp to be considered a major breach of human rights by amnesty international and a violation of the due process clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution by the center for constitutional rights bush s successor u s president barack obama promised that he would close the camp but met strong bipartisan opposition from the u s congress which passed laws to prohibit detainees from guantanamo being imprisoned in the u s during president obama s administration the number of inmates was reduced from about to in january u s president donald trump signed an executive order to keep the detention camp open indefinitely in may a prisoner was repatriated to saudi arabia during president trump s administration in early february the administration of u s president joe biden declared his intention to shut down the facility before he leaves office though critics have noted that the biden administration has taken few to no steps in the direction of closure instead he authorized several million dollars of expansions in early for future purposes seemingly unrelated to the few dozen remaining prisoners held over from the center s peak usage days most of whom remain uncharged with any crime as of september in july under the biden administration an additional detainee was released in december the new york times reported the pentagon is building a second facility courtroom in which the public will not be allowed to view the proceedings inside the courtroom instead journalists wishing to view the trials will be permitted to watch via a delayed video in a separate building after the trial has already taken place the times article further stated that the new design will permit simultaneous tribunals to occur on the premises starting in mid u s control of guant namo bay came about through the end of the spanish american war and the platt amendment this amendment was initiated in and outlined seven conditions for the u s withdrawal from cuba the united states intervened at the end of the spanish american war taking credit for cuban independence from spain the platt amendment was an amendment to the cuban constitution that supposedly gave cuba sovereignty however it included conditions that allowed for u s intervention and the ability for the united states to lease or buy lands in order to establish naval bases the u s was allowed to create up to four naval bases on the island of cuba but only ever built one at guant namo bay the platt amendment was repealed in which is why the cuban government considers the u s occupation of guant namo bay illegal the detention facility in the guantanamo bay naval base is operated by the joint task force guantanamo jtf gtmo of the southern command of the department of defense dod detention areas consisted of camp delta including camp echo camp iguana and camp x ray which is now closed after bush political appointees at the u s office of legal counsel department of justice advised the bush administration that the camp could be considered outside u s legal jurisdiction military guards took the first twenty detainees to camp x ray on january at the time secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said the detention camp was established to detain extraordinarily dangerous people to interrogate detainees in an optimal setting and to prosecute detainees for war crimes in practice the site has long been used for enemy combatants the dod at first kept secret the identity of the individuals held in guantanamo but after losing attempts to defy a freedom of information act request from the associated press the u s military officially acknowledged holding prisoners in the camp the bush administration asserted that detainees were not entitled to any of the protections of the geneva conventions while also claiming it was treating all detainees consistently with the principles of the geneva convention ensuing u s supreme court decisions since have determined otherwise and that u s courts do have jurisdiction it ruled in hamdan v rumsfeld on june that detainees were entitled to the minimal protections listed under common article of the geneva conventions following this on july the department of defense issued an internal memo stating that detainees would in the future be entitled to protection under common article current and former detainees have reported abuse and torture which the bush administration denied in a amnesty international report the facility was called the gulag of our times in the united nations unsuccessfully demanded that guantanamo bay detention camp be closed on january susan j crawford appointed by bush to review dod practices used at guantanamo bay and oversee the military trials became the first bush administration official to concede that torture occurred at guantanamo bay on one detainee mohammed al qahtani saying we tortured qahtani on january president obama issued a request to suspend proceedings at guantanamo military commission for days and to shut down the detention facility that year on january a military judge at guantanamo rejected the white house request in the case of abd al rahim al nashiri creating an unexpected challenge for the administration as it reviewed how the united states brings guantanamo detainees to trial on may the united states senate passed an amendment to the supplemental appropriations act of h r by a vote to block funds needed for the transfer or release of prisoners held at the guantanamo bay detention camp president obama issued a presidential memorandum dated december ordering thomson correctional center thomson illinois to be prepared to accept transferred guantanamo prisoners the final report of the guantanamo review task force dated january published the results for the detainees subject to the review were the subject of active cases or investigations detainees from yemen were designated for conditional detention due to the poor security environment in yemen detainees were approved for transfer detainees were determined too dangerous to transfer but not feasible for prosecution on january president obama signed the defense authorization bill which in part placed restrictions on the transfer of guantanamo prisoners to the mainland or to foreign countries thus impeding the closure of the facility in february u s secretary of defense robert gates said that guantanamo bay was unlikely to be closed due to opposition in the congress congress particularly opposed moving prisoners to facilities in the united states for detention or trial in april wikileaks began publishing secret files relating to prisoners in the guantanamo bay detention camp on november president barack obama stated that he was preparing to unveil a plan to close the facility and move some of the terrorism suspects held there to u s soil the plan would propose one or more prisons from a working list that includes facilities in kansas colorado and south carolina two others that were on the list in california and washington state do not appear to have made the preliminary cut according to a senior administration official familiar with the proposal by january however the detention center remained open with detainees remaining in june the new york times publicly released photographs of the first camp detainees using a freedom of information act foia request in colonel lawrence wilkerson a former aide to secretary of state colin powell stated in an affidavit that top u s officials including president george w bush vice president dick cheney and secretary of defense donald rumsfeld had known that the majority of the detainees initially sent to guant namo were innocent but that the detainees had been kept there for reasons of political expedience wilkerson s statement was submitted in connection with a lawsuit filed in federal district court by former detainee adel hassan hamad against the united states government and several individual officials this supported numerous claims made by former detainees like moazzam begg a british citizen who had been held for three years in detention camps in afghanistan and guantanamo as an enemy combatant under the claim that he was an al qaeda member who recruited for and provided money for al qaeda training camps and himself trained there to fight us or allied troops camp delta was a unit detention center finished in april it included detention camps through as well as camp echo where detainees not facing military commissions are held camp x ray was a temporary detention facility which was closed in april its prisoners were transferred to camp delta in the associated press reported camp a separate facility on the naval base that was considered the highest security jail on the base that facility held detainees previously imprisoned in a global clandestine network of cia prisons the precise location of camp has never been confirmed in early april camp was shut down due to deteriorating conditions of the facilities the five prisoners remaining were transferred to camp camp as well as camp were built in they are modeled after a high security facility in indiana in september camp was closed and a portion of it dedicated to use as a medical facility for detainees a portion of camp was again re dedicated in early april when camp so called high value former cia detainees were moved there in camp the u s government detains those who are not convicted in military commissions camp sourcewatch in january scott horton published an article in harper s magazine describing camp no a black site about mile km outside the main camp perimeter which included an interrogation center his description was based on accounts by four guards who had served at guantanamo they said prisoners were taken one at a time to the camp where they were believed to be interrogated he believes that the three detainees that dod announced as having committed suicide were questioned under torture the night of their deaths from to the cia operated a small site known informally as penny lane to house prisoners whom the agency attempted to recruit as spies against al qaeda the housing at penny lane was less sparse by the standards of guantanamo bay with private kitchens showers televisions and beds with mattresses the camp was divided into eight units its existence was revealed to the associated press in a institute on medicine as a profession imap report concluded that health professionals working with the military and intelligence services designed and participated in cruel inhumane and degrading treatment and torture of detainees medical professionals were ordered to ignore ethical standards during involvement in abusive interrogation including monitoring of vital signs under stress inducing procedures they used medical information for interrogation purposes and participated in force feeding of hunger strikers in violation of world medical association and american medical association prohibitions supporters of controversial techniques have declared that certain protections of the third geneva convention do not apply to al qaeda or taliban fighters claiming that the convention applies to only military personnel and guerrillas who are part of a chain of command wear distinctive insignia bear arms openly and abide by the rules of war jim phillips of the heritage foundation said that some of these terrorists who are not recognized as soldiers don t deserve to be treated as soldiers critics of u s policy such as george monbiot claimed the government had violated the conventions in attempting to create a distinction between prisoners of war and illegal combatants amnesty international called the situation a human rights scandal in a series of reports one of the allegations of abuse at the camp is the abuse of the religion of the detainees prisoners released from the camp have alleged incidents of abuse of religion including flushing the quran down the toilet defacing the quran writing comments and remarks on the quran tearing pages out of the quran and denying detainees a copy of the quran one of the justifications offered for the continued detention of mesut sen during his administrative review board hearing was emerging as a leader the detainee has been leading the detainees around him in prayer the detainees listen to him speak and follow his actions during prayer red cross inspectors and released detainees have alleged acts of torture including sleep deprivation beatings and locking in confined and cold cells the use of guant namo bay as a military prison has drawn criticism from human rights organizations and others who cite reports that detainees have been tortured or otherwise poorly treated supporters of the detention argue that trial review of detentions has never been afforded to prisoners of war and that it is reasonable for enemy combatants to be detained until the cessation of hostilities three british muslim prisoners known in the media at the time as the tipton three were repatriated to the united kingdom in march where officials immediately released them without charge the three alleged ongoing torture sexual degradation forced drugging and religious persecution being committed by u s forces at guant namo bay the former guantanamo detainee mehdi ghezali was freed without charge on july after two and a half years internment ghezali claimed that he was the victim of repeated torture omar deghayes alleged he was blinded by pepper spray during his detention juma al dossary claimed he was interrogated hundreds of times beaten tortured with broken glass barbed wire burning cigarettes and sexual assaults david hicks also made allegations of torture and mistreatment in guantanamo bay including sensory deprivation stress positions having his head slammed into concrete repeated anal penetration routine sleep deprivation and forced drug injections an associated press report claimed that some detainees were turned over to the u s by afghan tribesmen in return for cash bounties the first denbeaux study published by seton hall university law school reproduced copies of several leaflets flyers and posters the u s government distributed to advertise the bounty program some of which offered bounties of millions of dollars hunger striking detainees claimed that guards were force feeding them in the fall of detainees said large feeding tubes were forcibly shoved up their noses and down into their stomachs with guards using the same tubes from one patient to another the detainees say no sedatives were provided during these procedures which they allege took place in front of u s physicians including the head of the prison hospital a hunger striking detainee at guant namo bay wants a judge to order the removal of his feeding tube so he can be allowed to die one of his lawyers has said within a few weeks the department of defense extended an invitation to united nations special rapporteurs to visit detention facilities at guantanamo bay naval station this was rejected by the u n because of the dod restrictions that the three human rights officials invited to guant namo bay wouldn t be allowed to conduct private interviews with prisoners simultaneously the media reports began related to the question of prisoner treatment district court judge gladys kessler also ordered the u s government to give medical records going back a week before such feedings take place in early november the u s suddenly accelerated for unknown reasons the rate of prisoner release but this was not sustained in a leaked cable a state department official requested an interview of a released libyan national complaining of an arm disability and tooth loss that happened during his detention and interrogations in may detainees undertook a widespread hunger strike they were subsequently being force fed until the u s government stopped releasing hunger strike information due to it having no operational purpose during the month of ramadan that year the us military claimed that the amount of detainees on hunger strike had dropped from to however according to defense attorney clive stafford smith the military are cheating on the numbers as usual some detainees are taking a token amount of food as part of the traditional breaking of the fast at the end of each day in ramadan so that is now conveniently allowing them to be counted as not striking in the obama administration undertook a rebranding effort by referring to the hunger strikes as long term non religious fasting attorney alka pradhan petitioned a military judge to order the release of art made in her client ammar al baluchi s cell she complained that painting and drawing was made difficult and he was not permitted to give artwork to his counsel by may there had been at least six reported suicides in guant namo during august there were suicide attempts the u s officials did not say why they had not previously reported the incident after this event the pentagon reclassified alleged suicide attempts as manipulative self injurious behaviors camp physicians alleged that detainees do not genuinely wish to end their lives the prisoners supposedly feel that they may be able to get better treatment or release with suicide attempts daryl matthews a professor of forensic psychiatry at the university of hawaii who examined the prisoners stated that given the cultural differences between interrogators and prisoners intent was difficult if not impossible to make clinical depression is common in guant namo with of all prisoners being prescribed antidepressants such as prozac guantanamo bay officials have reported suicide attempts by detainees since the u s began taking prisoners to the base in january defense lawyers contend the number of suicide attempts is higher on june three detainees were found dead who according to the dod killed themselves in an apparent suicide pact prison commander rear admiral harry harris claimed this was not an act of desperation despite prisoners pleas to the contrary but rather an act of asymmetric warfare committed against us the three detainees were said to have hanged themselves with nooses made of sheets and clothes according to military officials the suicides were coordinated acts of protests human rights activists and defense attorneys said the deaths signaled the desperation of many of the detainees barbara olshansky of the center for constitutional rights which represented about guant namo detainees said that detainees have this incredible level of despair that they will never get justice at the time human rights groups called for an independent public inquiry into the deaths amnesty international said the apparent suicides are the tragic results of years of arbitrary and indefinite detention and called the prison an indictment of the george w bush administration s human rights record saudi arabia s state sponsored saudi human rights group blamed the u s for the deaths there are no independent monitors at the detention camp so it is easy to pin the crime on the prisoners it s possible they were tortured said mufleh al qahtani the group s deputy director in a statement to the local al riyadh newspaper highly disturbed about the deaths of its citizens under u s custody the saudi government pressed the united states to release its citizens into its custody from june through the u s released detainees of an original saudis detained to the saudi arabian government the saudi government developed a re integration program including religious education helping to arrange marriages and jobs to bring detainees back into society the center for policy and research published death in camp delta its analysis of the ncis report noting many inconsistencies in the government account and said the conclusion of suicide by hanging in their cells was not supported it suggested that camp administration officials had either been grossly negligent or were participating in a cover up of the deaths in january scott horton published an article in harper s magazine disputing the government s findings and suggesting the three died of accidental manslaughter following torture his account was based on the testimony of four members of the military intelligence unit assigned to guard camp delta including a decorated non commissioned army officer who was on duty as sergeant of the guard the night of june their account contradicts the report published by the naval criminal investigative service ncis horton said the deaths had occurred at a black site known as camp no outside the perimeter of the camp according to its spokeswoman laura sweeney the department of justice has disputed certain facts contained in the article about the soldiers account the international committee of the red cross icrc inspected some of the prison facilities in june in a confidential report issued in july and leaked to the new york times in november red cross inspectors accused the u s military of using humiliating acts solitary confinement temperature extremes and use of forced positions against prisoners the inspectors concluded that the construction of such a system whose stated purpose is the production of intelligence cannot be considered other than an intentional system of cruel unusual and degrading treatment and a form of torture the united states government reportedly rejected the red cross findings at the time on november the new york times published excerpts from an internal memo leaked from the u s administration referring to a report from the icrc the icrc reports of several activities that it said were tantamount to torture exposure to loud noise or music prolonged extreme temperatures or beatings it also reported that a behavioral science consultation team bsct also called biscuit and military physicians communicated confidential medical information to the interrogation teams weaknesses phobias etc resulting in the prisoners losing confidence in their medical care the icrc s access to the base was conditioned as is normal for icrc humanitarian operations on the confidentiality of their report following leaking of the u s memo some in the icrc wanted to make their report public or confront the u s administration the newspaper said the administration and the pentagon had seen the icrc report in july but rejected its findings the story was originally reported in several newspapers including the guardian and the icrc reacted to the article when the report was leaked in may according to a june new york times opinion article on july an fbi agent was quoted as saying on a couple of occasions i entered interview rooms to find a detainee chained hand and foot in a fetal position to the floor with no chair food or water most times they had urinated or defecated on themselves and had been left there for hours or more air force lt gen randall schmidt who headed the probe into fbi accounts of abuse of guant namo prisoners by defense department personnel concluded the man mohammed al qahtani a saudi described as the th hijacker was subjected to abusive and degrading treatment by the cumulative effect of creative persistent and lengthy interrogations the techniques used were authorized by the pentagon he said many of the released prisoners have complained of enduring beatings sleep deprivation prolonged constraint in uncomfortable positions prolonged hooding cultural and sexual humiliation enemas as well as other forced injections and other physical and psychological mistreatment during their detention in camp delta in army specialist sean baker a soldier posing as a prisoner during training exercises at the camp was beaten so severely that he suffered a brain injury and seizures in june the new york times reported that of the nearly detainees not more than two dozen were closely linked to al qaeda and that only very limited information could have been received from questionings in the only top terrorist was reportedly mohammed al qahtani from saudi arabia who is believed to have planned to participate in the september attacks in mohammed al qahtani was refused entry at orlando international airport which stopped him from his plan to take part in the attacks during his guant namo interrogations he was given bags of intravenous fluid then he was forbidden to use the toilet forcing him to soil himself accounts of the type of treatment he received include having water poured over him interrogations starting at midnight and lasting hours and psychological torture methods such as sleep deprivation via repeatedly being woken up by loud raucous music whenever he would fall asleep and military dogs being used to intimidate him soldiers would play the american national anthem and force him to salute he had images of victims of the september attacks affixed to his body he was forced to bark like a dog and his beard and hair were shaved an insult to muslim men he would be humiliated and upset by female personnel was forced to wear a bra and was stripped nude and had fake menstrual blood smeared on him while being made to believe it was real some of the abuses were documented in when the interrogation log of al qathani detainee was partially published the washington post in an may article described a set of interrogation techniques approved for use in interrogating alleged terrorists at guant namo bay kenneth roth executive director of human rights watch characterized them as cruel and inhumane treatment illegal under the u s constitution on june brigadier general janis karpinski commander at abu ghraib prison in iraq during the prisoner abuse scandal said she was told from the top to treat detainees like dogs as it is done in guant namo camp delta the former commander of camp x ray geoffrey miller had led the inquiry into the alleged abuses at abu ghraib during the allied occupation ex detainees of the guantanamo camp have made serious allegations including alleging geoffrey miller s complicity in abuse at camp x ray in whose god rules david mccolgin a defense attorney for guantanamo detainees recounts how a female government interrogator told muslim detainees she was menstruating slipped her hand into her pants and pulled it out with a red liquid smeared on it meant to look like menstrual blood the detainee screamed at the top of his lungs began shaking sobbing and yanked his arms against his handcuffs the interrogator explained to the detainee that he would now feel too dirty to pray and that she would have the guards turn off the water in his cell so he would not be able to wash the red substance off what do you think your brothers will think of you in the morning when they see an american woman s menstrual blood on your face she said as she left the cell these acts as well as interrogators desecrating the quran led the detainees to riots and mass suicide attempts the bbc published a leaked fbi email from december which said that the defense department interrogators at guant namo had impersonated fbi agents while using torture techniques on a detainee in an interview with cnn s wolf blitzer in june vice president dick cheney defended the treatment of prisoners at guant namo there isn t any other nation in the world that would treat people who were determined to kill americans the way we re treating these people they re living in the tropics they re well fed they ve got everything they could possibly want the united states government through the state department makes periodic reports to the united nations committee against torture as part of its treaty obligations under the u n convention against torture in october the u s report covered pretrial detention of suspects in the war on terrorism including those held in guant namo bay this periodic report is significant as the first official response of the u s government to allegations that prisoners are mistreated in guant namo bay while the report denies allegations of serious abuse it does detail substantiated incidents of misconduct and the training and punishments given to the perpetrators writing in the new york times on june former president jimmy carter criticized the methods used to obtain confessions some of the few being tried only in military courts have been tortured by waterboarding more than times or intimidated with semiautomatic weapons power drills or threats to sexually assault their mothers these facts cannot be used as a defense by the accused because the government claims they occurred under the cover of national security in it was reported that sexual methods were allegedly used by female interrogators to break muslim prisoners in a article from the guardian it was claimed that the cia used sexual abuse along with a wider array of other forms of torture detainee majid khan testified that interrogators poured ice water on his genitals twice videotaped him naked and repeatedly touched his private parts according to the same article a manual called camp delta standard operating procedure sop dated february and designated unclassified for official use only was published on wikileaks this is the main document for the operation of guant namo bay including the securing and treatment of detainees the page document includes procedures for identity cards and muslim burial it is signed by major general geoffrey d miller the document is the subject of an ongoing legal action by the american civil liberties union aclu which has been trying to obtain it from the department of defense on july the new york times revealed that the u s military trainers who came to guant namo bay in december had based an entire interrogation class on a chart copied directly from a air force study of chinese communist interrogation methodology commonly referred to as brainwashing that the united states alleged were used during the korean war to obtain confessions the chart showed the effects of coercive management techniques for possible use on prisoners including sleep deprivation prolonged constraint also known as stress positions and exposure the chart was copied from a article entitled communist attempts to elicit false confessions from air force prisoners of war written by albert d biderman working as a sociologist for the air force biderman had interviewed american prisoners of war returning from korea who had confessed to having taken part in biological warfare or involvement in other atrocities his article sets out that the most common interrogation method used by the chinese was to indirectly subject a prisoner to extended periods of what would initially be minor discomfort as an example prisoners would be required to stand for extended periods sometimes in a cold environment prolonged standing and exposure to cold are an accepted technique used by the american military and the cia to interrogate prisoners whom the united states classifies as unlawful combatants spies and saboteurs in wartime terrorists in unconventional conflicts although it is classified as torture under the geneva conventions the chart reflects an extreme model created by biderman to help in understanding what occurred apart from the extent to which it was realized in actuality biderman did not have a phd in sociology usually the minimum qualification required to carry out such work and the underlying research was not subjected to peer review his chart sets out in summary bullet points the techniques allegedly used by the chinese in korea the most extreme of which include semi starvation exploitation of wounds and use of filthy infested surroundings to make the prisoner dependent on interrogator to weaken mental and physical ability to resist and to reduce the prisoner to animal level biderman himself admits that he was working from a very small sample of american prisoners who claimed to have been mistreated and of the handful who had reported prolonged mistreatment none had become the ideal confessor the ultimate aim of the model it should be understood that only a few of the air force personnel who encountered efforts to elicit false confessions in korea were subjected to really full dress all out attempts to make them behave in the manner i have sketched the time between capture and repatriation for many was too short and presumably the trained interrogators available to the communists too few to permit this of the few air force prisoners who did get the full treatment none could be made to behave in complete accordance with the chinese communists ideal of the repentant criminal it is unclear from the article whether the sketch of techniques set out in the chart are supported by evidence from prisoner interviews or whether it simply presents communist methodology in idealized form in accordance with the conventions of the time while the chart ostensibly presents the methodology of the enemy it has come to have actual application at home in the military the techniques outlined by the chart are commonly referred to as biderman s principles and within the intelligence community it has come to be known as biderman s chart of coercion the chart is also often used by anti cult web sites to describe how religious cults control their members the article was motivated by the need for the united states to deal with prominent confessions of war crimes obtained by chinese interrogators during the korean war it was alleged at the time that american prisoners of war who had confessed had been brainwashed the allegation was taken seriously by the american military and it led them to develop a training program to counter the use of harsh methods used by an enemy interrogator almost all u s military personnel now receive survival evasion resistance and escape sere training to resist interrogation central to this training program is the theoretical model of the communist interrogation methodology as presented by mr biderman in this training program was adopted as a source of interrogation techniques to be used in the newly declared war on terror when it was adopted for use at the guant namo detention and interrogation facility the only change that was made to biderman s chart of coercion was to change the title originally called communist coercive methods for eliciting individual compliance the training document instructing on the use of these coercive methods was made public at a united states senate armed services committee hearing june investigating how such tactics came to be employed col steven kleinman who was head of a team of sere trainers testified before the senate committee that his team had been put under pressure to demonstrate the techniques on iraqi prisoners and that they had been sent home after kleinman had observed that the techniques were intended to be used as a form of punishment for those who wouldn t cooperate and put a stop to it sen carl levin chairman of the senate armed services committee was quoted after reviewing the evidence as saying what makes this document doubly stunning is that these were techniques to get false confessions people say we need intelligence and we do but we don t need false intelligence since january men have been brought to guantanamo nearly were released by mid before there had been any csrts combatant status review tribunal to review whether individuals were rightfully held as enemy combatants clarification needed of all detainees at guantanamo afghans were the largest group percent followed by saudi arabians percent yemenis percent pakistanis percent and algerians percent overall nationalities were present at guantanamo although the bush administration said most of the men had been captured fighting in afghanistan a report prepared by the center for policy and research at seton hall university law school reviewed dod data for the remaining men in and established that over of the prisoners were captured not by americans on the battlefield but by pakistanis and afghans often in exchange for bounty payments the u s widely distributed leaflets in the region and offered per prisoner one example is adel noori a chinese uyghur and dissident who had been sold to the us by pakistani bounty hunters top dod officials often referred to these prisoners as the worst of the worst but a memo by then secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said we need to stop populating guantanamo bay gtmo with low level enemy combatants gtmo needs to serve as an redacted not a prison for afghanistan the center for policy and research s report based on dod released data found that most detainees were low level offenders who were not affiliated with organizations on u s terrorist lists eight men have died in the prison camp dod has said that six were suicides dod reported three men two saudis and a yemeni had committed suicide on june government accounts including an ncis report released with redactions in august have been questioned by the press the detainees families the saudi government former detainees and human rights groups citation needed an estimated to minors under the age of were detained at guant namo bay and it has been claimed that this is in violation of international law according to chaplain kent svendsen who served as chaplain for the detention centers from to there were no minor detainees at the site upon starting his assignment in early he said i was given a tour of the camp and it was explained to me that minors were segregated from the general public and processed to be returned to their families the camp had long been emptied and closed when i arrived at my duty station in july detainees were moved out of guantanamo including who were released without charge sixty nine prisoners were transferred to the custody of governments of other countries according to the dod the center for constitutional rights has prepared biographies of some of the prisoners currently being held in guantanamo prison by may detainees had been released most of the men were released without charges or transferred to facilities in their home countries according to former u s president jimmy carter about half were cleared for release yet had little prospect of ever obtaining their freedom as of june detainees in addition to two who were deceased were designated to be detained indefinitely because the government said the prisoners were too dangerous to transfer and there was insufficient admissible evidence to try them it has been reported that prisoners cooperating with interrogations have been rewarded with happy meals from the mcdonald s on base after the release of saifullah paracha in october prisoners remained of which had been cleared for release pending identification of a suitable country in september president bush announced that high value detainees were to be transferred to military custody of the guant namo bay detention camp from civilian custody by the cia he admitted that these suspects had been held in cia secret prisons overseas known as black sites these people include khalid sheikh mohammed believed to be the no al qaeda leader before he was captured in pakistan in ramzi bin al shibh an alleged would be hijacker and abu zubaydah who was believed to be a link between osama bin laden and many al qaeda cells who were captured in pakistan in march khalid sheikh mohammed ramzi bin al shibh abu zubaydah mustafa al hawsawi ali abd al aziz ali walid bin attash in human rights groups and journalists found that some of these prisoners had been taken to other locations including in europe and interrogated under torture in the u s extraordinary rendition program before arriving at guantanamo on february the u s military charged khalid sheikh mohammed ramzi bin al shibh mustafa ahmad al hawsawi ali abd al aziz ali and walid bin attash with committing the september attacks under the military commission system as established under the military commissions act of mca in boumediene v bush the u s supreme court ruled that the mca was unconstitutional on february charges against abd al rahim al nashiri were dropped without prejudice after an order by obama to suspend trials for days abd al rahim al nashiri was accused of renting a small boat connected with the uss cole bombing senior law enforcement agents with the criminal investigation task force told msnbc com in that they began to complain inside the defense department in that the interrogation tactics used by a separate team of intelligence investigators were unproductive not likely to produce reliable information and probably illegal unable to get satisfaction from the army commanders running the detainee camp they took their concerns to david brant director of the ncis who alerted navy general counsel alberto j mora general counsel mora and navy judge advocate general michael lohr believed the detainee treatment to be unlawful and campaigned among other top lawyers and officials in the defense department to investigate and to provide clear standards prohibiting coercive interrogation tactics in response on january donald rumsfeld suspended the approved interrogation tactics at guant namo until a new set of guidelines could be produced by a working group headed by general counsel of the air force mary walker the working group based its new guidelines on a legal memo from the department of justice office of legal counsel written by john yoo and signed by jay s bybee which would later become widely known as the torture memo general counsel mora led a faction of the working group in arguing against these standards and argued the issues with yoo in person the working group s final report was signed and delivered to guant namo without the knowledge of mora and the others who had opposed its content nonetheless mora has maintained that detainee treatment has been consistent with the law since january suspension of previously approved interrogation tactics on may the new york times reported on a high level military investigation into accusations of detainee abuse at guant namo conducted by lt gen randall m schmidt of the air force and dealing with accounts by agents for the federal bureau of investigation who complained after witnessing detainees subjected to several forms of harsh treatment the f b i agents wrote in memorandums that were never meant to be disclosed publicly that they had seen female interrogators forcibly squeeze male prisoners genitals and that they had witnessed other detainees stripped and shackled low to the floor for many hours in june the united states house committee on armed services visited the camp and described it as a resort and complimented the quality of the food democratic members of the committee complained that republicans had blocked the testimony of attorneys representing the prisoners on july members of a military panel told the committee that they

recommendation was overruled by general bantz j craddock commander of u s southern command who referred the matter to the army s inspector general citation needed the senate armed services committee report on detainee treatment was declassified and released in it stated the abuse of detainees in u s custody cannot simply be attributed to the actions of a few bad apples acting on their own the fact is that senior officials in the united states government solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques redefined the law to create the appearance of their legality and authorized their use against detainees those efforts damaged our ability to collect accurate intelligence that could save lives strengthened the hand of our enemies and compromised our moral authority on

accidentally declassified judge green wrote it fails to provide significant details to support its conclusory allegations does not reveal the sources for its information and is contradicted by other evidence in the record eugene r fidell said that the kurnaz dossier suggests the csrt procedure is a sham if a case like that can get through then the merest scintilla of evidence against someone

namo bay detainees accused of attending combat training at an al qaeda camp in afghanistan saying the court needs more information on french intelligence missions to guant namo defense lawyers for the

secret service interviews with the detainees without their lawyers present kross scheduled new hearings for may calling the former head of counterterrorism at the french direction de la surveillance du territoire intelligence agency to testify on october united states district court judge richard j leon ordered the release of the five algerians held at guant namo bay cuba and the continued detention of a sixth bensayah belkacem in the summer of the government instituted a new protocol for civilian attorneys representing guantanamo prisoners it required lawyers to sign a memorandum of understanding in which they agreed to certain restrictions in order to continue to see their clients a federal court order had governed lawyers access to their detainee clients and classified information related to their capture and confinement government lawyers sought court approval to replace the court s protective order with the mou to enable military officials to establish and enforce their own rules about when and how detainees could have access to legal counsel citation needed under the rules of the mou lawyers access was restricted for those detainees who no longer have legal challenges pending the new government rules tightened access to classified information and gave the commander of the joint task force guantanamo complete discretion over lawyers access to the detainees including visits to the base and letters the justice department took the position that guantanamo bay detainees whose legal challenges have been dismissed do not need the same level of access to counsel as detainees who are still fighting in court on september u s district chief judge royce c lamberth rejected the government s arguments writing that the government was confusing the roles of the jailer and the judiciary judge lamberth rejected the military s assertion that it could veto meetings between lawyers and detainees judge lamberth ruled that access by lawyers to their detainee clients at guant namo must continue under the terms of a long standing protective order issued by federal judges in washington in april cuban diplomats tabled a united nations resolution calling for a un investigation of guant namo bay in may martin scheinin a united nations rapporteur on rights in countering terrorism released a preliminary report for the united nations human rights council the report stated the united states violated international law particularly the international covenant on civil and political rights that the bush administration could not try such prisoners as enemy combatants in a military tribunal and could not deny them access to the evidence used against them prisoners have been labeled illegal or unlawful enemy combatants but several observers such as the center for constitutional rights and human rights watch maintain that the united states has not held the article tribunals required by the geneva conventions the international committee of the red cross has stated that every person in enemy hands must have some status under international law he is either a prisoner of war and as such covered by the third convention a civilian covered by the fourth convention or a member of the medical personnel of the armed forces who is covered by the first convention there is no intermediate status nobody in enemy hands can fall outside the law thus if the detainees are not classified as prisoners of war this would still grant them the rights of the fourth geneva convention as opposed to the more common third geneva convention which deals exclusively with prisoners of war a u s court has rejected this argument as it applies to detainees from al qaeda henry t king jr a prosecutor for the nuremberg trials has argued that the type of tribunals at guant namo bay violates the nuremberg principles and that they are against the spirit of the geneva conventions of some have argued in favor of a summary execution of all unlawful combatants using ex parte quirin as the precedent a case during world war ii that upheld the use of military tribunals for eight german saboteurs caught on u s soil while wearing civilian clothes the germans were deemed to be unlawful combatants and thus not entitled to pow status six of the eight were executed as spies in the electric chair on the request of the u s president franklin d roosevelt the validity of this case as basis for denying prisoners in the war on terrorism protection by the geneva conventions has been disputed a report by the american bar association commenting on this case states that the quirin case does not stand for the proposition that detainees may be held incommunicado and denied access to counsel the report notes that the quirin defendants could seek review and were represented by counsel a report published in april in the plos medicine journal looked at the cases of nine individuals for evidence of torture and ill treatment and documentation by medical personnel at the base by reviewing medical records and relevant legal case files client affidavits attorney client notes and summaries and legal affidavits of medical experts the findings in these nine cases from the base indicate that medical doctors and mental health personnel assigned to the dod neglected and or concealed medical evidence of intentional harm and the detainees complained of abusive interrogation methods that are consistent with torture as defined by the un convention against torture as well as the more restrictive us definition of torture that was operational at the time the group physicians for human rights has claimed that health professionals were active participants in the development and implementation of the interrogation sessions and monitored prisoners to determine the effectiveness of the methods used a possible violation of the nuremberg code which bans human experimentation on prisoners the base which is considered legally to be leased by the cuban government to the american navy is on territory that is recognized by both governments to be sovereign cuban territory guantanamo bay was leased by cuba to the american government through the agreement between the united states and cuba for the lease of lands for coaling and naval stations signed by the president of cuba and the president of the united states on february the post cuban government has repudiated the agreement on the grounds that it was forced upon them by the united states and therefore was a not valid legal agreement citation needed the lease agreement from says in article the grant of the foregoing article shall include the right to use and occupy the waters adjacent to said areas of land and water and to improve and deepen the entrances thereto and the anchorages therein and generally to do any and all things necessary to fit the premises for use as coaling or naval stations only and for no other purpose the american bar association announced that in response to the unprecedented attacks of september on november the president announced that certain non citizens of the us would be subject to detention and trial by military authorities the order provides that non citizens whom the government deems to be or to have been members of the al qaida organization or to have engaged in aided or abetted or conspired to commit acts of international terrorism that have caused threaten to cause or have as their aim to cause injury to or adverse effects on the united states or its citizens or to have knowingly harbored such individuals are subject to detention by military authorities and trial before a military commission on and september the u s senate and house of representatives respectively passed the military commissions act of a controversial bill that allows the president to designate certain people with the status of unlawful enemy combatants thus making them subject to military commissions where they have fewer civil rights than in regular trials in camp justice was the informal name granted to the complex where guant namo detainees would face charges before the guantanamo military commissions as authorized by the military commissions act of it was named by sgt neil felver of the civil engineering squadron in a contest initially the complex was to be a permanent facility costing over million the u s congress overruled the bush administration s plans the camp was redesigned as a portable temporary facility costing approximately million on january the toronto star reporter michelle shephard offered an account of the security precautions that reporters go through before they can attend the hearings reporters are not supposed to hear the sound from the court directly a second delay is inserted if a classified document is read a red light starts and the sound is turned off immediately on november david mcfadden of the associated press stated the tents erected to hold lawyers reporters and observers were practically deserted when he and two other reporters covered the military commission for ali hamza al bahlul in late october three detainees have been convicted by military court of

ex detainees who had been returned to the uk in march of that year and freed by the british authorities within hours of their return filed a report in the us claiming persistent severe abuse at the camp of themselves and others they claimed that false confessions were extracted from them under duress in conditions that amounted to torture they alleged that conditions deteriorated after major general geoffrey d miller took charge of the camp including increased periods of solitary confinement for the detainees they claimed that the abuse took place with the knowledge of the intelligence forces their claims are currently being investigated by the british government at the time five british residents remained as detainees bisher amin khalil al rawi jamil al banna shaker abdur raheem

combatants in these reviews the prisoners were interviewed thoroughly on the details of their crimes and roles in taliban and al qaeda activities including the extent of their relationship and correspondence with osama bin laden in these interviews the detainees also extensively detailed the alleged abuse and neglect that they faced while in detention at guantanamo bay prison the events described by these prisoners violated the geneva conventions standards of conduct with prisoners of war yet the conventions were previously claimed to not protect members of the taliban or al qaeda militias in correspondence between the department of defense and the assistant attorney general and u s department of justice in the full versions of these combatant status reviews were released in in response to an aclu lawsuit besides convening csrts the dod initiated a similar annual review like the csrts the board did not have a mandate to review whether detainees qualified for pow status under the geneva conventions the board s mandate was to consider the factors for and against the continued detention of detainees and make a recommendation either for their retention release or transfer to the custody of their country of origin the first set of annual reviews considered the dossiers of detainees the first board met between december and december the board recommended the release of detainees and repatriation of detainees to the custody of their country of origin by november of the then detainees held at guantanamo bay had administrative review board hearings of these were

return them to china fearing that china would imprison persecute or torture them because of internal political issues us officials said that their overtures to approximately countries to grant the individuals asylum had been declined leaving the men with no destination for release on may five uyghurs were transported to refugee camps in albania and the department of justice filed an emergency

was the first guantanamo detainee released since and after his departure detainees still remained imprisoned nasir was originally cleared for release by the obama administration in but remained in custody initially due to bureaucratic delays and later due to president trump s policy changes restricting guantanamo prisoner releases a state department spokesman stated the biden administration remains dedicated to a deliberate and thorough process focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing of the guantanamo facility critics have contended that the biden administration may not be prepared or able to fully close the prison on the basis that in order to close the prison biden would need to move all detainees to other prisons or locations and that there have not been enough concrete steps taken in order to ensure existing detainees are successfully relocated and the closing steps are carried out over the course of spring the american government

to prisoners of war from afghanistan and has misused the designation of illegal combatant to apply to criminal suspects on u s soil on may amnesty international released its annual report calling the facility the gulag of our times lord steyn called it a monstrous failure of justice because the military will act as interrogators prosecutors and defense counsel judges and when death sentences are imposed as executioners the trials will be held in private none of the guarantees of a fair trial need be observed another senior british judge mr justice collins said of the detention center america s idea of what is torture is not the same as the united kingdom s at the beginning of december there were media reports that military lawyers appointed to defend alleged terrorists being held by the united states at guant namo bay had expressed concern about the legal process for military commissions the guardian newspaper from the united kingdom reported that a team of lawyers was dismissed

newspapers are critical of the camp columnist thomas friedman urged george w bush to just shut it down calling camp delta worse than an embarrassment another new york times editorial supported friedman s proposal arguing that guant namo is part of a chain of shadowy detention camps that includes abu ghraib in iraq the military prison at bagram air base in afghanistan and other secret locations run by the intelligence agencies that are part of a tightly linked global detention system with no accountability in law in november a group of experts from the united nations commission on human rights called off their visit to camp delta originally scheduled for december saying that the united states was not allowing them to conduct private interviews with the prisoners since the americans have not accepted the minimum requirements for such a visit we must cancel it manfred nowak the un envoy in charge of investigating torture allegations around the world told afp the group nevertheless stated its intention to write a report on conditions at the prison based on eyewitness accounts from released detainees meetings with lawyers and information from human rights groups in february the un group released its report which called on the u s either to try or release all suspected terrorists the report issued by the working group on arbitrary detention has the subtitle situation of detainees at guant namo bay this includes as an appendix the u s ambassador s reply to the draft versions of the report in which he restates the u s government s position on the detainees european leaders have also voiced their opposition to the internment center on january german chancellor angela merkel criticized the u s detention of prisoners at guant namo bay an institution like guant namo in its present form cannot and must not exist in the long term we must find different ways of dealing with prisoners as far as i m concerned there s no question about that she declared in a january interview to der spiegel meanwhile in the uk peter hain the secretary of state for northern ireland stated during a live broadcast of question time february that i would prefer that it wasn t there and i would prefer it was closed his cabinet colleague and former prime minister of the united kingdom tony blair declared the following day that the center was an anomaly and sooner or later it s got to be dealt with on march a letter in the lancet was published signed by more than medical experts urging the united states to stop force feeding of detainees and close down the prison force feeding is specifically prohibited by the world medical association force feeding declarations of tokyo and malta to which the american medical association is a signatory dr david nicholl who had

criticism from arab leaders on may prominent kuwaiti parliamentarian waleed al tabtabaie demanded that u s president bush uncover what is going on inside guant namo allow family visits to the hundreds of muslim detainees there and allow an independent investigation of detention conditions in may the attorney general for england and wales lord goldsmith said the camp s existence was unacceptable and tarnished the u s traditions of liberty and justice the historic tradition of the united states as a beacon of freedom liberty and of justice deserves the removal of this symbol he said also in may the un committee against torture condemned prisoners treatment at guant namo bay noted that indefinite detention constitutes per se a violation of the un convention against torture and called on the u s to shut down the guant namo facility in june the european parliament voted overwhelmingly in support of a motion urging the united states to close the camp in june u s senator arlen specter stated that the arrests of most of the roughly prisoners held there were based on the flimsiest sort of hearsay in september the uk s lord chancellor lord falconer who heads the uk s legal system went further than previous british government statements condemning the existence of the camp as a shocking affront to democracy lord falconer who said he was expressing government policy made the comments in a lecture at the supreme court of new south wales according to former u s secretary of state colin powell essentially we have shaken the belief the world had in america s justice system by keeping a place like guant namo open and creating things like the military commission we don t need it and it is causing us far more damage than any good we get for it in march a group of british parliamentarians formed an all party parliamentary group to campaign against guant namo bay the group is made up of members of parliament and peers from each of the main british political parties and is chaired by sarah teather with des turner and richard shepherd acting as vice chairs the group was launched with an ambassadors reception in the house of commons bringing together a large group of lawyers non governmental organizations and governments with an interest in seeing the camp closed on april there was a debate in the united states senate over the detainees at guant namo bay that ended in a draw with democrats urging action on the prisoners behalf but running into stiff opposition from republicans some visitors to guant namo have expressed more positive views on the camp alain grignard who visited gitmo in objected to the detainees legal status but declared that it is a model prison where people are better treated than in belgian prisons grignard then deputy head of brussels federal police anti terrorism unit served as expert on a trip by a group of lawmakers from the assembly of the organization for security and co operation in europe osce i know no belgian prison where each inmate receives its muslim kit mr grignard said according to polls conducted by the program on international policy pip attitudes large majorities in germany and great britain and pluralities in poland and india believe the united states has committed violations of international law at its prison on guant namo bay in cuba including the use of torture in interrogations pip found a marked decrease in the perception of the u s as a leader of human rights as a result of the international community s opposition to the guant namo prison a poll conducted by the bbc world service together with globescan in countries found that of respondents disapprove of the guant namo prison and the u s treatment of detainees american actions in guant namo coupled with the abu ghraib scandal are considered major factors in the decline of the u s s image abroad michael lehnert who as a u s marine brigadier general helped establish the center and was its first commander for days has stated that was dismayed at what happened after he was replaced by a u s army commander lehnert stated that he had ensured that the detainees would be treated humanely and was disappointed that his successors allowed harsh interrogations to take place said lehnert i think we lost the moral high ground for those who do not think much of the moral high ground that is not that significant but for those who think our standing in the international community is important we need to stand for american values you have to walk the walk talk the talk in a foreword to amnesty international s international report the secretary general irene khan made a passing reference to the guant namo bay prison as the gulag of our times breaking an internal policy on not comparing different human rights abuses the report reflected ongoing claims of prisoner abuse at guant namo and other military prisons former soviet era gulag prisoner pavel litvinov criticized the analogy saying by any standard guantanamo and similar american run prisons elsewhere do not resemble in their conditions of detention or their scale the concentration camp system that was at the core of a totalitarian communist system the comparison has been supported by some including edmund mcwilliams and william f schulz in an article was published in australian folklore a yearly journal of folklore studies that in part explored the way that the international image of the american government was shifting due to guant namo prison yet in february poll of americans including of self described liberal democrats and of moderate or conservative democrats replied they approve the continued operation of guantanamo morris moe davis the former chief prosecutor for the terrorism trials at guantanamo bay resigned in over objections regarding evidence obtained from waterboarding which he viewed as a form of torture davis s change org e petition to close guantanamo has garnered over signatures and mentions the hunger strikes that involves more than prisoners including some who are being force fed to keep them from starving to death on december retired u s marine major general michael r lehnert who oversaw the construction of the guant namo detention facility published an op ed piece in the detroit free press he characterized the guantanamo as our nation s most notorious prison a prison that should never have been opened and provided a brief summary of its history and significance our nation created guant namo because we were legitimately angry and frightened by an unprovoked attack on our soil on sept we thought that the detainees would provide a treasure trove of information and intelligence i was ordered to construct the first cells at guant namo within hours the first group of prisoners arrived seven days after the order was given we were told that the prisoners were the worst of the worst a common refrain for every set of detainees sent to guant namo the u s has held men at the detention facility over the past years there are currently men there most of them cleared for transfer but stuck by politics even in the earliest days of guant namo i became more and more convinced that many of the detainees should never have been sent in the first place they had little intelligence value and there was insufficient evidence linking them to war crimes that remains the case today for many if not most of the detainees in september alberto mora who served as general counsel of the department of the navy from to wrote that his team s research on the torture policy s broader implications revealed that it greatly damaged national security it incited extremism in the middle east hindered cooperation with u s allies exposed american officials to legal repercussions undermined u s diplomacy and offered a convenient justification for other governments to commit human rights abuses during his presidential campaign barack obama described guant namo as a sad chapter in american history and promised to close down the prison in after being elected obama reiterated his campaign promise on minutes and the abc program this week on january obama stated that he had ordered the government to suspend prosecutions of guant namo bay detainees for days to review all the detainees cases to determine whether and how each detainee should be prosecuted a day later obama signed an executive order stating that guant namo detention camp would be closed within the year his plan encountered a setback when incoming officials of his administration discovered that there were no comprehensive files concerning many of the detainees so that merely assembling the available evidence about them could take weeks or months in may obama announced that the prosecutions would be revived on may the united states senate passed an amendment to the supplemental appropriations act h r by a vote to block funds needed for the transfer or release of prisoners held at the guantanamo bay detention camp in november obama admitted that the specific deadline he had set for closure of the guantanamo bay camp would be missed he said the camp would probably be closed later in but did not set a specific deadline in may carol rosenberg writing in the miami herald reported that the camps would not be immediately dismantled when the detainees are released or transferred due to ongoing cases alleging abuse of detainees in august the u s disciplinary barracks at fort leavenworth kansas and the standish maximum correctional facility in standish michigan were considered potential sites for transfers of over prisoners kansas public officials including both of its senators and governor objected to transferring prisoners to the former many in standish however welcomed the move to the latter obama issued a presidential memorandum dated december formally closing the detention center and ordering the transfer of prisoners to the thomson correctional center in thomson illinois now united states penitentiary thomson attorney marc falkoff who represents some of the yemeni detainees said that his clients might prefer to remain in guantanamo rather than move into the more stark conditions at thomson illinois senator dick durbin s office announced on october that the obama administration and federal bureau of prisons would buy the thomson correctional center from illinois for million an administration official said the deal was to address overcrowding issues and thomson would not be used to house any guant namo detainees which the official noted was prohibited by law the entire facility will house only bureau of prison inmates up to and be operated solely by bop specifically it will be used for administrative maximum security inmates and others who have proven difficult to manage in high security institutions said the official who asked not to be named this statement was echoed in letter from u s attorney general eric holder i have committed that no guantanamo detainees will be transferred to thomson as you know any such transfer would violate express legal statutory prohibitions holder said in a letter to representative frank wolf who fought the proposal the guantanamo review task force issued a final report on january released on may the report recommended releasing current detainees to their homes or to a third country be prosecuted in either federal court or a military commission and be held indefinitely under the laws of war in addition yemenis were approved for release if security conditions in their home country improve on january president obama signed the defense authorization bill which contains provisions that place restrictions on the transfer of guant namo prisoners to the mainland or to other foreign countries thus impeding the closure of the detention facility the bill prohibits the use of funds to modify or construct facilities in the united states to house detainees transferred from guant namo bay he strongly objected to the clauses and stated that he would work with congress to oppose the measures regarding the provisions preventing the transfer of guant namo prisoners to the mainland obama wrote in a statement that the prosecution of terrorists in federal court is a powerful tool in our efforts to protect the nation and must be among the options available to us any attempt to deprive the executive branch of that tool undermines our nation s counterterrorism efforts and has the potential to harm our national security obama s order included provisions preventing the transfer of guant namo prisoners to other foreign countries writing that requiring the executive branch to certify to additional conditions would hinder the conduct of delicate negotiations with foreign countries and therefore the effort to conclude detainee transfers in accord with our national security obama signed the defense authorization bill but nevertheless the obama administration will work with the congress to seek repeal of these restrictions will seek to mitigate their effects and will oppose any attempt to extend or expand them in the future the president s statement said on march obama gave the green light to resume military trials conducted by military officers with a military judge presiding of terror suspects detained at guant namo bay he also signed an executive order that requires a review of detainees status within a year and every four years after that to determine whether they remain a threat and scheduled for a military trial or should be released the order required compliance with the geneva conventions and the international treaty banning torture and inhumane treatment the delay of guant namo bay s closing resulted in some controversy among the public on december the new york times published an op ed written by retired united states marine corps generals charles c krulak and joseph p hoar the two criticized how a provision of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year ndaa would extend a ban on transfers from guant namo ensuring that this morally and financially expensive symbol of detainee abuse would remain open well into the future both argued the move would bolster al qaeda s recruiting efforts and make it nearly impossible to transfer men of the held there who had been cleared for release on december after signing ndaa obama voiced his concerns regarding certain provisions of the act including section which renews the bar against using appropriated funds for fiscal year to transfer guant namo detainees into the united states for any purpose he continued to state opposition to the provision which he argued intrudes upon critical executive branch authority to determine when and where to prosecute guant namo detainees based on the facts and the circumstances of each case and our national security interests moreover this intrusion would under certain circumstances violate constitutional separation of powers principles obama closed his concerns by stating his administration would aggressively seek to mitigate those concerns through the design of implementation procedures and other authorities available to me as chief executive and commander in chief will oppose any attempt to extend or expand them in the future and will seek the repeal of any provisions that undermine the policies and values that have guided my administration throughout my time in office in early july reports surfaced saying guant namo bay was getting an estimated million communications upgrade because the outdated satellite communications system was overburdened with the military court hearing the cases of war on terrorism suspects as well as by the ongoing detention operations these reports therefore indicated the us military was preparing for long term operations at guant namo but they were denied by army lt col todd breasseale a spokesman for the guant namo military commissions he said the communications upgrade project is meant to serve the guantanamo naval station rather than the detention camp which washington still has plans to close citation needed on july abc news reported setbacks in congress as well as a need to focus on a stagnant economy in the united states had made the issue of closing the detention camp a lesser priority the channel also asked obama if he planned on ever closing guantanamo bay to which he replied he did some blamed congress for the delay in closing the detention camp while others blamed the president national security council spokesman tommy vietor said in a statement obviously congress has taken a number of steps to prevent the closure of the prison at guant namo bay but the president still believes it s in our national security interest and will keep trying in the same interview however senior aclu attorney zachary katznelson argued obama had enough control and power that he could have gotten those men out today if he had the political will to do so on september the us government disclosed the names of of the prisoners cleared for transfer from guant namo bay prison all of the names publicized were those of prisoners that obama s inter agency guantanamo bay review task force had approved for release from the prison previously the government had maintained the names of prisoners cleared could not be made public because it would interfere with diplomatic efforts to repatriate or resettle prisoners in their home country or other countries in november the senate voted to prevent detainees from being transferred to the us at the end of december president obama stated he has not given up the idea of trying terror suspects housed at guantanamo bay in united states courts the executive branch must have the authority to determine when and where to prosecute guantanamo detainees based on the facts and circumstances of each case and our national security interests obama wrote in a signing statement attached to a new defense authorization bill called the national defense authorization act for fiscal which relaxed restrictions on transferring detainees from the u s prison at guantanamo bay cuba to the custody of foreign governments on january during the state of the union address obama stated guant namo bay is not who we are and that it was time to close gitmo a little less than a week later the huffington post published an article by tom hayden arguing guant namo bay would be best closed by returning the base to cuban sovereignty arguing it is where guant namo bay belongs historically on november obama stated that he was preparing to unveil a plan to close the camp and move some prisoners to us soil the plan proposed one or more prisons from a working list that included facilities in kansas colorado and south carolina two others that were on the list in california and washington state didn t appear to have made the preliminary cut needs update on february obama stated that years after congress disagreed to vague close the camp it has come to a conclusion of closing the camp the exact time frame of the camp closing was not revealed at february there were prisoners in guant namo from these were recommended for transfer if security conditions could be met the remaining prisoners were expected to be brought to u s facilities in the united states if brought to the united states some of those detainees would continue through military commissions others might face trial in civilian courts potential facilities in the united states that might be used to house detainees were reviewed by the obama administration but their names were not revealed this information was published because congress had asked the administration to provide information about where and how the administration intended to hold existing and future detainees if guantanamo was closed obama s plan was rejected by several republicans in congress on august prisoners were transferred from the prison twelve yemeni nationals and afghans were transferred to the united arab emirates bringing the total number of prisoners to with more cleared for transfer obama did not close the prison before leaving office but had reduced the number of prisoners to president donald trump vowed to keep the prison open and to use it to detain terrorists potentially including american supporters of isis on january just before delivering his state of the union address trump signed an executive order to keep the prison open indefinitely on february us president joe biden announced a review of plans to close the camp by the end of his term at the time there were prisoners at the camp most of whom had been held for nearly two decades without being charged or tried as of march one prisoner mohammed al qahtani was

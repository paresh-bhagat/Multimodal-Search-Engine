 wall street is an eight block long street in the financial district of lower manhattan in new york city it runs between broadway in the west to south street and the east river in the east the term wall street has become a metonym for the financial markets of the united states as a whole the american financial services industry new york based financial interests or the financial district itself anchored by wall street new york has been described as the world s principal financial center wall street was originally known in dutch as de waalstraat when it was part of new amsterdam in the th century though the origins of the name vary an actual wall existed on the street from to during the th century wall street was a slave trading marketplace and a securities trading site and from the early eighteenth century the location of federal hall new york s first city hall in the early th century both residences and businesses occupied the area but increasingly business predominated and new york city s financial industry became centered on wall street in the th century several early skyscrapers were built on wall street including wall street once the world s tallest building the wall street area is home to the new york stock exchange the world s largest stock exchange by total market capitalization as well as the federal reserve bank of new york and many commercial banks and insurance companies several other stock and commodity exchanges have also been located in downtown manhattan near wall street including the new york mercantile exchange and other commodity futures exchanges and the american stock exchange to support the business they did on the exchanges many brokerage firms had offices nearby however the direct economic impacts of wall street activities extend worldwide wall street itself is a narrow and winding street running from the east river to broadway and lined with skyscrapers as well as the new york stock exchange building and federal hall national memorial and one wall street at its western end the street is nearby multiple new york city subway lines and ferry terminals and both the world trade center site and the new world trade center there are varying accounts about how the dutch named de waalstraat literally walloon street got its name three conflicting explanations can be considered one explanation maintains that wall street was named after walloons the dutch name for a walloon being waal among the first settlers that embarked on the ship nieu nederlandt in were walloon families in peter minuit the governor of the colony who became famous by the purchase of manhattan island for the dutch west india company was a walloon another name used for the same street was cingel which is a dutch word singel for either an outer barrier with trees and brush growing along a wall to protect a town or the more common use of being a canal or moat dug for defense purposes in dutch the waal is the most important river in the netherlands an arm of the rhine river that is the widest fork of the rhine shortly after crossing the dutch border as such the word could have indicated a water course the map does not show any protective canal at this location though it would have been a common design feature for dutch towns if there had been plans to build such defense and it had not taken place then the name waal straat could have been used tongue in cheek for that governing promise and this name then replacing the name cingel another explanation is that the name of the street was indeed derived from a wall or rampart actually a wooden palisade on the northern boundary of the new amsterdam settlement built to protect against potential incursions from native americans pirates and the english the wall was built of dirt and foot m wooden planks measuring feet m long and feet m tall while the dutch word wal can be translated as rampart it only appeared as de wal straat on some english maps of new amsterdam whereas other english maps show the name as de waal straat the distinction of this one letter is similar to the distinction in english between ben and been or between star and stare the distinct meanings are fully understood both by speaker and listener according to one version of the story the red people from manhattan island crossed to the mainland where a treaty was made with the dutch and the place was therefore called the pipe of peace in their language hoboken but soon after that the dutch governor kieft sent his men out there one night and massacred the entire population few of them escaped but they spread the story of what had been done and this did much to antagonize all the remaining tribes against all the white settlers shortly after nieuw amsterdam erected a double palisade for defense against its now enraged red neighbors and this remained for some time the northern limit of the dutch city the space between the former walls is now called wall street and its spirit is still that of a bulwark against the people in the s basic picket and plank fences denoted plots and residences in the colony later on behalf of the dutch west india company peter stuyvesant using both enslaved africans and white colonists collaborated with the city government in the construction of a more substantial fortification a strengthened foot m wall in surveyors laid out wall street along the lines of the original stockade the wall started at pearl street which was the shoreline at that time crossing the indian path broadway and ending at the other shoreline today s trinity place where it took a turn south and ran along the shore until it ended at the old fort in these early days local merchants and traders would gather at disparate spots to buy and sell shares and bonds and over time divided themselves into two classes auctioneers and dealers wall street was also the marketplace where owners could hire out their slaves by the day or week the rampart was removed in and a new city hall built at wall and nassau in slavery was introduced to manhattan in but it was not until december that the new york city common council made wall street the city s first official slave market for the sale and rental of enslaved africans and indians the slave market operated from to at the corner of wall and pearl streets it was a wooden structure with a roof and open sides although walls may have been added over the years and could hold approximately men the city directly benefited from the sale of slaves by implementing taxes on every person who was bought and sold there in the late th century there was a buttonwood tree at the foot of wall street under which traders and speculators would gather to trade securities the benefit was being in proximity to each other in traders formalized their association with the buttonwood agreement which was the origin of the new york stock exchange the idea of the agreement was to make the market more structured and without the manipulative auctions with a commission structure persons signing the agreement agreed to charge each other a standard commission rate persons not signing could still participate but would be charged a higher commission for dealing in wall street was the scene of the united states first presidential inauguration when george washington took the oath of office on the balcony of federal hall on april this was also the location of the passing of the bill of rights alexander hamilton who was the first treasury secretary and architect of the early united states financial system is buried in the cemetery of trinity church as is robert fulton famed for his steamboats in the first few decades both residences and businesses occupied the area but increasingly business predominated there are old stories of people s houses being surrounded by the clamor of business and trade and the owners complaining that they can t get anything done according to a historian named burrows the opening of the erie canal in the early th century meant a huge boom in business for new york city since it was the only major eastern seaport which had direct access by inland waterways to ports on the great lakes wall street became the money capital of america historian charles r geisst suggested that there has constantly been a tug of war between business interests on wall street and authorities in washington d c the capital of the united states by then generally during the th century wall street developed its own unique personality and institutions with little outside interference in the s and s most residents moved further uptown to midtown manhattan because of the increased business use at the lower tip of the island the civil war had the effect of causing the northern economy to boom bringing greater prosperity to cities like new york which came into its own as the nation s banking center connecting old world capital and new world ambition according to one account j p morgan created giant trusts and john d rockefeller s standard oil moved to new york city between and the economy changed from agricultural to industrial to financial and new york maintained its leadership position despite these changes according to historian thomas kessner new york was second only to london as the world s financial capital in charles dow began tracking stocks initially beginning with stocks mostly railroads and looked at average prices for these eleven some of the companies included in dow s original calculations were american tobacco company general electric laclede gas company national lead company tennessee coal iron and united states leather company when the average peaks and troughs went up consistently he deemed it a bull market condition if averages dropped it was a bear market he added up prices and divided by the number of stocks to get his dow jones average dow s numbers were a convenient benchmark for analyzing the market and became an accepted way to look at the entire stock market in the original stock report customers afternoon letter became the wall street journal named in reference to the actual street it became an influential international daily business newspaper published in new york city after october it began publishing dow s expanded list of stocks a century later there were stocks in the average business writer john brooks in his book once in golconda considered the start of the th century period to have been wall street s heyday the address of wall street the headquarters of j p morgan company known as the corner was the precise center geographical as well as metaphorical of financial america and even of the financial world wall street has had changing relationships with government authorities in for example when authorities proposed a stock transfer tax stock clerks protested at other times city and state officials have taken steps through tax incentives to encourage financial firms to continue to do business in the city a post office was built at wall street in during the world war i years occasionally there were fund raising efforts for projects such as the national guard on september close to the corner of wall and broad street the busiest corner of the financial district and across the offices of the morgan bank a powerful bomb exploded it killed and seriously injured people the perpetrators were never identified or apprehended the explosion did however help fuel the red scare that was underway at the time a report from the new york times the tomb like silence that settles over wall street and lower broadway with the coming of night and the suspension of business was entirely changed last night as hundreds of men worked under the glare of searchlights to repair the damage to skyscrapers that were lighted up from top to bottom the assay office nearest the point of explosion naturally suffered the most the front was pierced in fifty places where the cast iron slugs which were of the material used for window weights were thrown against it each slug penetrated the stone an inch or two cm and chipped off pieces ranging from three inches to a foot cm in diameter the ornamental iron grill work protecting each window was broken or shattered the assay office was a wreck it was as though some gigantic force had overturned the building and then placed it upright again leaving the framework uninjured but scrambling everything inside the area was subjected to numerous threats one bomb threat in led to detectives sealing off the area to prevent a repetition of the wall street bomb explosion september was the peak of the stock market october was when the market started to slip and it continued throughout the week of october in october renowned yale economist irving fisher reassured worried investors that their money was safe on wall street a few days later on october stock values plummeted the stock market crash of ushered in the great depression in which a quarter of working people were unemployed with soup kitchens mass foreclosures of farms and falling prices during this era development of the financial district stagnated and wall street paid a heavy price and became something of a backwater in american life during the new deal years as well as the s there was much less focus on wall street and finance the government clamped down on the practice of buying equities based only on credit but these policies began to ease from to stocks could not be purchased on margin meaning that an investor had to pay of a stock s cost without taking on any loans however this margin requirement was reduced four times before each time stimulating a mini rally and boosting volume and when the federal reserve reduced the margin requirements from to these changes made it somewhat easier for investors to buy stocks on credit the growing national economy and prosperity led to a recovery during the s with some down years during the early s in the aftermath of the vietnam war trading volumes climbed in according to time magazine volume hit million shares a day which caused a traffic jam of paper with batteries of clerks working overtime to clear transactions and update customer accounts in the financial community posted a collective loss of million which spurred temporary help from the government reforms were instituted the securities exchange commission eliminated fixed commissions which forced brokers to compete freely with one another for investors business in the sec threw out the nyse s rule which had required that most stock transactions take place on the big board s floor in effect freeing up trading for electronic methods in banks were allowed to buy and sell stocks which provided more competition for stockbrokers reforms had the effect of lowering prices overall making it easier for more people to participate in the stock market broker commissions for each stock sale lessened but volume increased the reagan years were marked by a renewed push for capitalism and business with national efforts to de regulate industries such as telecommunications and aviation the economy resumed upward growth after a period in the early s of languishing a report in the new york times described that the flushness of money and growth during these years had spawned a drug culture of sorts with a rampant acceptance of cocaine use although the overall percent of actual users was most likely small a reporter wrote the wall street drug dealer looked like many other successful young female executives stylishly dressed and wearing designer sunglasses she sat in her chevrolet camaro in a no parking zone across the street from the marine midland bank branch on lower broadway the customer in the passenger seat looked like a successful young businessman but as the dealer slipped him a heat sealed plastic envelope of cocaine and he passed her cash the transaction was being watched through the sunroof of her car by federal drug agents in a nearby building and the customer an undercover agent himself was learning the ways the wiles and the conventions of wall street s drug subculture in the stock market plunged and in the relatively brief recession following the surrounding area lost jobs according to one estimate since telecommunications costs were coming down banks and brokerage firms could move away from the financial district to more affordable locations one of the firms looking to move away was the nyse in the nyse and the city struck a million deal which kept the nyse from moving across the river to jersey city the deal was described as the largest in city history to prevent a corporation from leaving town in the big board as some termed the nyse was described as the world s largest and most prestigious stock market when the world trade center was destroyed on september the attacks crippled the communications network and destroyed many buildings in the financial district although the buildings on wall street itself saw only little physical damage one estimate was that of wall street s best office space had been lost the nyse was determined to re open on september almost a week after the attack during this time rockefeller group business center opened additional offices at wall street still after september the financial services industry went through a downturn with a sizable drop in year end bonuses of billion according to one estimate from a state comptroller s office to guard against a vehicular bombing in the area authorities built concrete barriers and found ways over time to make them more aesthetically appealing by spending to apiece on bollards parts of wall street as well as several other streets in the neighborhood were blocked off by specially designed bollards rogers marvel designed a new kind of bollard a faceted piece of sculpture whose broad slanting surfaces offer people a place to sit in contrast to the typical bollard which is supremely unsittable the bollard which is called the nogo looks a bit like one of frank gehry s unorthodox culture palaces but it is hardly insensitive to its surroundings its bronze surfaces actually echo the grand doorways of wall street s temples of commerce pedestrians easily slip through groups of them as they make their way onto wall street from the area around historic trinity church cars however cannot pass the guardian reporter andrew clark described the years of to as tumultuous in which the heartland of america was mired in gloom with high unemployment around with average house prices falling from in to and foreboding increases in the national debt to trillion but that despite the setbacks the american economy was once more bouncing back what had happened during these heady years clark wrote but the picture is too nuanced simply to dump all the responsibility on financiers most wall street banks didn t actually go around the us hawking dodgy mortgages they bought and packaged loans from on the ground firms such as countrywide financial and new century financial both of which hit a financial wall in the crisis foolishly and recklessly the banks didn t look at these loans adequately relying on flawed credit rating agencies such as standard poor s and moody s which blithely certified toxic mortgage backed securities as solid a few of those on wall street including maverick hedge fund manager john paulson and the top brass at goldman sachs spotted what was going on and ruthlessly gambled on a crash they made a fortune but turned into the crisis s pantomime villains most though got burned the banks are still gradually running down portfolios of non core loans worth bn the first months of was a particularly troublesome period which caused federal reserve chairman ben bernanke to work holidays and weekends and which did an extraordinary series of moves it bolstered u s banks and allowed wall street firms to borrow directly from the fed through a vehicle called the fed s discount window a sort of lender of last report these efforts were highly controversial at the time but from the perspective of it appeared the federal exertions had been the right decisions by wall street firms in clark s view were getting back to their old selves as engine rooms of wealth prosperity and excess a report by michael stoler in the new york sun described a phoenix like resurrection of the area with residential commercial retail and hotels booming in the third largest business district in the country at the same time the investment community was worried about proposed legal reforms including the wall street reform and consumer protection act which dealt with matters such as credit card rates and lending requirements the nyse closed two of its trading floors in a move towards transforming itself into an electronic exchange beginning in september demonstrators disenchanted with the financial system protested in parks and plazas around wall street on october wall street was disrupted when new york and new jersey were inundated by hurricane sandy its foot high m storm surge a local record caused massive street flooding nearby the nyse was closed for weather related reasons the first time since hurricane gloria in september and the first two day weather related shutdown since the blizzard of wall street s architecture is generally rooted in the gilded age the older skyscrapers often were built with elaborate facades which have not been common in corporate architecture for decades there are numerous landmarks on wall street some of which were erected as the headquarters of banks these include another key anchor for the area is the new york stock exchange building at the corner of broad street it houses the new york stock exchange which is by far the world s largest stock exchange per market capitalization of its listed companies at us trillion as of june city authorities realize its importance and believed that it has outgrown its neoclassical temple at the corner of wall and broad streets and in offered substantial tax incentives to try to keep it in the financial district plans to rebuild it were delayed by the september attacks the exchange still occupies the same site the exchange is the locus for a large amount of technology and data for example to accommodate the three thousand people who work directly on the exchange floor requires kilowatts of electricity along with phone circuits on the trading floor alone and miles km of fiber optic cable below ground finance professor charles r geisst wrote that the exchange has become inextricably intertwined into new york s economy wall street pay in terms of salaries and bonuses and taxes is an important part of the economy of new york city the tri state metropolitan area and the united states anchored by wall street new york city has been called the world s most economically powerful city and leading financial center as such a falloff in wall street s economy could have wrenching effects on the local and regional economies in after a downturn in the stock market the decline meant billion less in taxable income with less money available for apartments furniture cars clothing and services estimates vary about the number and quality of financial jobs in the city one estimate was that wall street firms employed close to persons in another estimate was that in the financial services industry which had a billion profit became percent of the city s revenue another estimate in was that the financial services industry makes up of the city s work force and of the tax base an additional estimate from by steve malanga of the manhattan institute was that the securities industry accounts for percent of the jobs in new york city but percent of its wages and he estimated there were securities industries jobs in new york both wall street area and midtown paying an average of annually between and the sector grew at an annual rate of about annually a respectable rate but that other financial centers were growing faster another estimate made in was that wall street provided a fourth of all personal income earned in the city and of new york city s tax revenue the city s securities industry enumerating jobs in august continues to form the largest segment of the city s financial sector and an important economic engine accounting in for percent of private sector jobs in new york city percent us billion of the city s tax revenue and percent of the city s total wages including an average salary of us the seven largest wall street firms in the s were bear stearns jpmorgan chase citigroup goldman sachs morgan stanley merrill lynch and lehman brothers during the recession of many of these firms including lehman went out of business or were bought up at firesale prices by other financial firms in lehman filed for bankruptcy bear stearns was bought by jpmorgan chase forced by the u s government and merrill lynch was bought by bank of america in a similar shot gun wedding these failures marked a catastrophic downsizing of wall street as the financial industry goes through restructuring and change since new york s financial industry provides almost one fourth of all income produced in the city and accounts for of the city s tax revenues and of the state s the downturn has had huge repercussions for government treasuries new york s mayor michael bloomberg reportedly over a four year period dangled over million in tax incentives to persuade goldman sachs to build a story headquarters in the financial district near the destroyed world trade center site in things looked somewhat gloomy with one analysis by the boston consulting group suggesting that jobs had been permanently lost because of the downturn but there were signs that manhattan property prices were rebounding with price rises of annually in and bonuses were being paid once more with average bonuses over in a requirement of the new york stock exchange was that brokerage firms had to have offices clustered around wall street so clerks could deliver physical paper copies of stock certificates each week there were some indications that midtown had been becoming the locus of financial services dealings even by but as technology progressed in the middle and later decades of the th century computers and telecommunications replaced paper notifications meaning that the close proximity requirement could be bypassed in more situations many financial firms found that they could move to midtown manhattan only four miles km away and still operate effectively for example the former investment firm of donaldson lufkin jenrette was described as a wall street firm but had its headquarters on park avenue in midtown a report described the migration from wall street the financial industry has been slowly migrating from its historic home in the warren of streets around wall street to the more spacious and glamorous office towers of midtown manhattan morgan stanley j p morgan chase citigroup and bear stearns have all moved north nevertheless a key magnet for the wall street remains the new york stock exchange building some old guard firms such as goldman sachs and merrill lynch bought by bank of america in have remained fiercely loyal to the financial district location and new ones such as deutsche bank have chosen office space in the district so called face to face trading between buyers and sellers remains a cornerstone of the nyse with a benefit of having all of a deal s players close at hand including investment bankers lawyers and accountants after wall street firms started to expand westward in the s into new jersey the direct economic impacts of wall street activities have gone beyond new york city the employment in the financial services industry mostly in the back office roles has become an important part of new jersey s economy in the wall street employment wages were paid in the amount of almost billion in the state the industry contributed billion or percent to the new jersey s gross domestic product in the same year the most significant area with wall street employment is in jersey city in the wall street west employment contributed to one third of the private sector jobs in jersey city within the financial service cluster there were three major sectors more than percent were in the securities industry percent were in banking and percent in insurance additionally new jersey has become the main technology infrastructure to support the wall street operations a substantial amount of securities traded in the united states are executed in new jersey as the data centers of electronic trading in the u s equity market for all major stock exchanges are located in north and central jersey a significant amount of securities clearing and settlement workforce is also in the state this includes the majority of the workforce of depository trust company the primary u s securities depository and the depository trust clearing corporation the parent company of national securities clearing corporation the fixed income clearing corporation and emerging markets clearing corporation having a direct tie to wall street employment can be problematic for new jersey however the state lost percent of its employment base from to in the financial services sector in the fallout of the subprime mortgage crisis of the street s importance as a financial center new york times analyst daniel gross wrote in today s burgeoning and increasingly integrated global financial markets a vast neural spaghetti of wires web sites and trading platforms the n y s e is clearly no longer the epicenter nor is new york the largest mutual fund complexes are in valley forge pa los angeles and boston while trading and money management are spreading globally since the end of the cold war vast pools of capital have been forming overseas in the swiss bank accounts of russian oligarchs in the shanghai vaults of chinese manufacturing magnates and in the coffers of funds controlled by governments in singapore russia dubai qatar and saudi arabia that may amount to some trillion an example is the alternative trading platform known as bats based in kansas city which came out of nowhere to gain a percent share in the market for trading united states stocks the firm has computers in the u s state of new jersey and only two salespeople in new york city the remaining employees work in a center in kansas wall street in a conceptual sense represents financial and economic power to americans it can sometimes represent elitism and power politics and its role has been a source of controversy throughout the nation s history particularly beginning around the gilded age period in the late th century wall street became the symbol of a country and economic system that many americans see as having developed through trade capitalism and innovation the term wall street has become a metonym for the financial markets of the united states as a whole the american financial services industry or new york based financial interests wall street has become synonymous with financial interests often used negatively during the subprime mortgage crisis from to wall street financing was blamed as one of the causes although most commentators blame an interplay of factors the u s government with the troubled asset relief program bailed out the banks and financial backers with billions of taxpayer dollars but the bailout was often criticized as politically motivated and was criticized by journalists as well as the public analyst robert kuttner in the huffington post criticized the bailout as helping large wall street firms such as citigroup while neglecting to help smaller community development banks such as chicago s shorebank one writer in the huffington post looked at fbi statistics on robbery fraud and crime and concluded that wall street was the most dangerous neighborhood in the united states if one factored in the billion fraud perpetrated by bernie madoff when large firms such as enron worldcom and global crossing were found guilty of fraud wall street was often blamed even though these firms had headquarters around the nation and not in wall street many complained that the resulting sarbanes oxley legislation dampened the business climate with regulations that were overly burdensome interest groups seeking favor with washington lawmakers such as car dealers have often sought to portray their interests as allied with main street rather than wall street although analyst peter overby on national public radio suggested that car dealers have written over billion in consumer loans and have real ties with wall street when the united states treasury bailed out large financial firms to ostensibly halt a downward spiral in the nation s economy there was tremendous negative political fallout particularly when reports came out that monies supposed to be used to ease credit restrictions were being used to pay bonuses to highly paid employees analyst william d cohan argued that it was obscene how wall street reaped massive profits and bonuses in after being saved by trillions of dollars of american taxpayers treasure despite wall street s greed and irresponsible risk taking washington post reporter suzanne mcgee called for wall street to make a sort of public apology to the nation and expressed dismay that people such as goldman sachs chief executive lloyd blankfein hadn t expressed contrition despite being sued by the sec in mcgee wrote that bankers aren t the sole culprits but their too glib denials of responsibility and the occasional vague and waffling expression of regret don t go far enough to deflect anger but chief banking analyst at goldman sachs richard ramsden is unapologetic and sees banks as the dynamos that power the rest of the economy ramsden believes risk taking is vital and said in you can construct a banking system in which no bank will ever fail in which there s no leverage but there would be a cost there would be virtually no economic growth because there would be no credit creation others in the financial industry believe they ve been unfairly castigated by the public and by politicians for example anthony scaramucci reportedly told president barack obama in that he felt like a pi ata whacked with a stick by hostile politicians the financial misdeeds of various figures throughout american history sometimes casts a dark shadow on financial investing as a whole and include names such as william duer jim fisk and jay gould the latter two believed to have been involved with an effort to collapse the u s gold market in as well as modern figures such as bernard madoff who bilked billions from investors in addition images of wall street and its figures have loomed large the oliver stone film wall street created the iconic figure of gordon gekko who used the phrase greed is good which caught on in the cultural parlance gekko is reportedly based on multiple real life individuals on wall street including corporate raider carl icahn disgraced stock trader ivan boesky and investor michael ovitz in stone commented how the film had had an unexpected cultural influence not causing them to turn away from corporate greed but causing many young people to choose wall street careers because of the film a reporter repeated other lines from the film i m talking about liquid rich enough to have your own jet rich enough not to waste time fifty a hundred million dollars buddy a player wall street firms have however also contributed to projects such as habitat for humanity as well as done food programs in haiti trauma centers in sudan and rescue boats during floods in bangladesh many people associated with wall street have become famous although in most cases their reputations are limited to members of the stock brokerage and banking communities others have gained national and international fame for some like hedge fund manager ray dalio their fame is due to skillful investment strategies financing reporting legal or regulatory activities while others such as ivan boesky michael milken and bernie madoff are remembered for their notable failures or scandal with wall street being historically a commuter destination a plethora of transportation infrastructure has been developed to serve it pier near wall street s eastern end is a busy terminal for new york waterway nyc ferry new york water taxi and seastreak the downtown manhattan heliport also serves wall street there are three new york city subway stations under wall street route map

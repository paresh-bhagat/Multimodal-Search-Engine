operate under cat ii conditions of a minimum m ft visibility on march igi became the first indian airport to operate two runways simultaneously following a test run involving a spicejet plane landing on runway and a jet airways plane taking off from runway at the same time the initially proposed mode involving simultaneous takeoffs in westerly flow to increase handling traffic capacity caused several near misses over the west side of the airport where the centrelines of runways and intersect the runway use was changed to segregate dependent mode on december which was a few days after the deciding near miss involving an airbus a of qatar airways and an indigo a aircraft the new method involved the use of runway for all departures and runway for all arrivals this more streamlined model was adopted during day hours ist until september on august the airport inaugurated its third runway r l costing billion and m ft long the runway has one of the world s longest paved threshold displacements of m ft this in turn decreases the available landing length on runway l to m ft the purpose of this large threshold displacement is to reduce noise generated by landing aircraft over nearby localities the runway increases the airport s capacity to handle up to flights from the previous flights per hour the new runway was opened for commercial operations on september and gradually began full round the clock operations by the end of october the same year since all three runways are operated simultaneously to handle traffic during day hours only runways r l and are operated during night ist hours with single runway landing restriction during westerly traffic flow that is rotated late night ist and reversed weekly to distribute and mitigate night time landing noise over

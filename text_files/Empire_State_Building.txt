 the empire state building is a story c art deco skyscraper in midtown manhattan new york city the building was designed by shreve lamb harmon and built from to its name is derived from empire state the nickname of the state of new york the building has a roof height of feet m and stands a total of feet m tall including its antenna the empire state building was the world s tallest building until the world trade center was constructed in following the collapse of the world trade center in the empire state building was new york city s tallest building until it was surpassed in as of update the building is the seventh tallest building in new york city the ninth tallest completed skyscraper in the united states the th tallest in the world and the sixth tallest freestanding structure in the americas the site of the empire state building in midtown south on the west side of fifth avenue between west rd and th streets was developed in as the waldorf astoria hotel in empire state inc acquired the site and devised plans for a skyscraper there the design for the empire state building was changed fifteen times until it was ensured to be the world s tallest building construction started on march and the building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on may despite favorable publicity related to the building s construction because of the great depression and world war ii its owners did not make a profit until the early s the building s art deco architecture height and observation decks have made it a popular attraction around four million tourists from around the world annually visit the building s th and nd floor observatories an additional indoor observatory on the th floor opened in the empire state building is an international cultural icon it has been featured in more than television series and films since the film king kong was released in the building s size has become the global standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures a symbol of new york city the building has been named as one of the seven wonders of the modern world by the american society of civil engineers it was ranked first on the american institute of architects list of america s favorite architecture in additionally the empire state building and its ground floor interior were designated city landmarks by the new york city landmarks preservation commission in and were added to the national register of historic places as a national historic landmark in the empire state building is located on the west side of fifth avenue in midtown manhattan between rd street to the south and th street to the north tenants enter the building through the art deco lobby located at fifth avenue visitors to the observatories use an entrance at west th street prior to august visitors entered through the fifth avenue lobby although physically located in south midtown a mixed residential and commercial area the building is so large that it was assigned its own zip code as of update it is one of buildings in new york city that have their own zip codes b the areas surrounding the empire state building are home to other major points of interest including macy s at herald square on sixth avenue and th street and koreatown on nd street between madison and sixth avenues to the east of the empire state building is murray hill a neighborhood with a mix of residential commercial and entertainment activity the block directly to the northeast contains the b altman and company building which houses the city university of new york s graduate center while the demarest building is directly across fifth avenue to the east the nearest new york city subway stations are th street herald square one block west and rd street at park avenue two blocks east there is also a path station at rd street and sixth avenue the empire state building was designed by shreve lamb and harmon in the art deco style the empire state building is ft m tall to its nd floor or feet inches m including its foot m pinnacle it was the first building in the world to be more than stories tall though only the lowest stories are usable the first through th floors contain million square feet m of commercial and office space while the th story contains an observatory the remaining stories are part of the spire which is capped by an observatory on the nd floor the spire does not contain any intermediate levels and is used mostly for mechanical purposes atop the nd story is the ft m pinnacle much of which is covered by broadcast antennas and surmounted with a lightning rod the building has been named one of the seven wonders of the modern world by the american society of civil engineers the building and its street floor interior are designated landmarks of the new york city landmarks preservation commission and confirmed by the new york city board of estimate it was designated as a national historic landmark in in it was first on the aia s list of america s favorite architecture the empire state building has a symmetrical massing because of its large lot and relatively short base its articulation consists of three horizontal sections similar to the components of a column namely a base shaft and capital the five story base occupies the entire lot while the story shaft above it is set back sharply from the base the setback above the th story is feet m deep on all sides there are smaller setbacks on the upper stories allowing sunlight to illuminate the interiors of the top floors while also positioning these floors away from the noisy streets below the setbacks are located at the st th th nd st and th stories the setbacks correspond to the tops of elevator shafts allowing interior spaces to be at most feet m deep see interior the setbacks were mandated by the zoning resolution which was intended to allow sunlight to reach the streets as well d normally a building of the empire state s dimensions would be permitted to build up to stories on the fifth avenue side and up to stories on the rd th streets side before it would have to utilize setbacks however with the largest setback being located above the base the tower stories could contain a uniform shape according to architectural writer robert a m stern the building s form contrasted with the nearly contemporary similarly designed fifth avenue eight blocks north which had an asymmetrical massing on a smaller lot the empire state building s art deco design is typical of pre world war ii architecture in new york city the facade is clad in indiana limestone panels sourced from the empire mill in sanders indiana which give the building its signature blonde color according to official fact sheets the facade uses cubic feet m of limestone and granite ten million bricks and short tons long tons of aluminum and stainless steel the building also contains windows the decorative features on the facade are largely geometric in contrast with earlier buildings whose decorations often were intended to represent a specific narrative the main entrance composed of three sets of metal doors is at the center of the facade s fifth avenue elevation flanked by molded piers that are topped with eagles above the main entrance is a transom a triple height transom window with geometric patterns and the golden letters empire state above the fifth floor windows there are two entrances each on rd and th streets with modernistic stainless steel canopies projecting from the entrances on rd and th streets there above the secondary entrances are triple windows less elaborate in design than those on fifth avenue the storefronts on the first floor contain aluminum framed doors and windows within a black granite cladding the second through fourth stories consist of windows alternating with wide stone piers and narrower stone mullions the fifth story contains windows alternating with wide and narrow mullions and is topped by a horizontal stone sill the facade of the tower stories is split into several vertical bays on each side with windows projecting slightly from the limestone cladding the bays are arranged into sets of one two or three windows on each floor the bays are separated by alternating narrow and wide piers the inclusion of which may have been influenced by the design of the contemporary daily news building the windows in each bay are separated by vertical nickel chrome steel mullions and connected by horizontal aluminum spandrels between each floor the windows are placed within stainless steel frames which eliminated the need to saved money by removing the need to apply a stone finish around the windows in addition the use of aluminum spandrels obviated the need for cross bonding which would have been required if stone had been used instead the building was originally equipped with white searchlights at the top they were first used in november when they lit up to signal roosevelt s victory over hoover in the presidential election of that year these were later swapped for four freedom lights in in february flood lights were added on the nd floor to illuminate the top of the building at night so that the building could be seen from the world fair later that year the lights were shut off from november to july because of the energy crisis at the time in the businessman douglas leigh suggested that wien and helmsley install metal halide lights which were four times as bright as the incandescent lights they were to replace new red white and blue metal halide lights were installed in time for the country s bicentennial that july after the bicentennial helmsley retained the new lights due to the reduced maintenance cost about a year since october the spire has been lit in colors chosen to match seasonal events and holidays organizations are allowed to make requests through the building s website the building is also lit in the colors of new york based sports teams on nights when they host games for example orange blue and white for the new york knicks red white and blue for the new york rangers the spire can also be lit to commemorate events including disasters anniversaries or deaths as well as for celebrations such as pride and halloween in the building was lit in blue after the death of singer frank sinatra who was nicknamed ol blue eyes the structure was lit in red white and blue for several months after the collapse of the world trade center on september on january the building was lit in red orange and yellow to honor the th anniversary of nbc program the today show after retired basketball player kobe bryant s january death the building was lit in purple and gold signifying the colors of his former team the los angeles lakers in the building s four hundred metal halide lamps and floodlights were replaced with led fixtures increasing the available colors from nine to over million the computer controlled system allows the building to be illuminated in ways that were unable to be done previously with plastic gels for instance cnn used the top of the empire state building as a scoreboard during the united states presidential election using red and blue lights to represent republican and democratic electoral votes respectively also on november the building had its first synchronized light show using music from recording artist alicia keys artists such as eminem and onerepublic have been featured in later shows including the building s annual holiday music to lights show the building s owners adhere to strict standards in using the lights for instance they do not use the lights to play advertisements according to official fact sheets the empire state building weighs short tons t and has an internal volume of million cubic feet m the interior required miles km of elevator cable and million feet m of electrical wires it has a total floor area of sq ft m and each of the floors in the base cover acres ha this gives the building capacity for tenants and visitors the riveted steel frame of the building was originally designed to handle all of the building s gravitational stresses and wind loads the amount of material used in the building s construction resulted in a very stiff structure when compared to other skyscrapers with a structural stiffness of pounds per square foot kpa versus the willis tower s pounds per square foot kpa and the john hancock center s pounds per square foot kpa a december feature in popular mechanics estimated that a building with the empire state s dimensions would still stand even if hit with an impact of short tons long tons utilities are grouped in a central shaft on the th through th stories the central shaft is surrounded by a main corridor on all four sides per the final specifications of the building the corridor is surrounded in turn by office space feet m deep maximizing office space at a time before air conditioning became commonplace each of the floors has structural columns that pass through it which provide structural stability but limits the amount of open space on these floors the relative dearth of stone in the empire state building allows for more space overall with a stone to building ratio compared to a ratio in similar buildings the original main lobby is accessed from fifth avenue on the building s east side and is the only place in the building where the design contains narrative motifs it contains an entrance with one set of double doors between a pair of revolving doors at the top of each doorway is a bronze motif depicting one of three crafts or industries used in the building s construction electricity masonry and heating the three story high space which runs parallel to rd and th streets contains storefronts to the north and south these storefronts are flanked by tubes of dark rounded marble and topped by a vertical band of grooves set into the marble the lobby contains two tiers of marble a lighter marble on the top above the storefronts and a darker marble on the bottom flush with the storefronts there is a pattern of zigzagging terrazzo tiles on the lobby floor which leads from east to west the western ends of the north and south walls include escalators to a mezzanine level e at the west end of the lobby behind the security desk is an aluminum relief of the skyscraper as it was originally built without the antenna the relief which was intended to provide a welcoming effect contains an embossed outline of the building with rays radiating from the spire and the sun behind it in the background is a state map of new york with the building s location marked by a medallion in the very southeast portion of the outline a compass is depicted in the bottom right and a plaque to the building s major developers is on the bottom left a scale model of the building was also placed south of the security desk the plaque at the western end of the lobby is on the eastern interior wall of a one story tall rectangular shaped corridor that surrounds the banks of escalators with a similar design to the lobby the rectangular shaped corridor actually consists of two long hallways on the northern and southern sides of the rectangle as well as a shorter hallway on the eastern side and another long hallway on the western side at both ends of the northern and southern corridors there is a bank of four low rise elevators in between the corridors the western side of the rectangular elevator bank corridor extends north to the th street entrance and south to the rd street entrance it borders three large storefronts and leads to escalators originally stairs which go both to the second floor and to the basement going from west to east there are secondary entrances to th and rd streets from the northern and southern corridors respectively e the side entrances from rd and th street lead to two story high corridors around the elevator core crossed by stainless steel and glass enclosed bridges at the mezzanine floor until the s an art deco mural inspired by both the sky and the machine age was installed in the lobby ceilings subsequent damage to these murals designed by artist leif neandross resulted in reproductions being installed renovations to the lobby in such as replacing the clock over the information desk in the fifth avenue lobby with an anemometer and installing two chandeliers intended to be part of the building when it originally opened revived much of its original grandeur the north corridor contained eight illuminated panels created in by roy sparkia and ren e nemorov in time for the world s fair depicting the building as the eighth wonder of the world alongside the traditional seven the building s owners installed a series of paintings by the new york artist kysa johnson in the concourse level johnson later filed a federal lawsuit in january under the visual artists rights act alleging the negligent destruction of the paintings and damage to her reputation as an artist as part of the building s renovation denise amses commissioned a work consisting of stars and circles superimposed on a by foot by m etched glass installation in the lobby the empire state building has elevators in all including service elevators its original elevators built by the otis elevator company in a central core and are of varying heights with the longest of these elevators reaching from the lobby to the th floor as originally built there were four express elevators that connected the lobby th floor and several landings in between the other local elevators connected the landings with the floors above these intermediate landings of the total elevators were for passenger use comprising the four express elevators and local elevators and eight were for freight deliveries the elevators were designed to move at feet per minute m min at the time of the skyscraper s construction their practical speed was limited to feet per minute m min per city law but this limit was removed shortly after the building opened additional elevators connect the th floor to the six floors above it as the six extra floors were built after the original stories were approved the elevators were mechanically operated until when they were replaced with automatic elevators during the million renovation of the building an additional elevator connects the th and nd floor observatories which allows visitors access the nd floor observatory after having their tickets scanned it also allows employees to access the mechanical floors located between the th and st floors the th th and nd floors contain observatories the latter two observatories saw a combined average of four million visitors per year in since opening the observatories have been more popular than similar observatories at rockefeller plaza the chrysler building the first one world trade center or the woolworth building despite being more expensive there are variable charges to enter the observatories one ticket allows visitors to go as high as the th floor and there is an additional charge to visit the nd floor other ticket options for visitors include scheduled access to view the sunrise from the observatory a premium guided tour with vip access and the am pm package which allows for two visits in the same day the th floor observatory contains both an enclosed viewing gallery and an open air outdoor viewing area allowing for it to remain open days a year regardless of the weather the nd floor observatory is completely enclosed and much smaller in size the nd floor observatory was closed to the public from the late s to due to limited viewing capacity and long lines the observation decks were redesigned in mid the nd floor was again redesigned in a project that was completed in allowing the windows to be extended from floor to ceiling and widening the space in the observatory overall an observatory on the th floor opened in includes various exhibits as well as a mural of the skyline drawn by british artist stephen wiltshire according to a report by concierge com the five lines to enter the observation decks are as legendary as the building itself concierge com stated that there were five lines the sidewalk line the lobby elevator line the ticket purchase line the second elevator line and the line to get off the elevator and onto the observation deck however in new york city s official tourism website nycgo com made note of only three lines the security check line the ticket purchase line and the second elevator line following renovations completed in designed to streamline queuing and reduce wait times guests enter from a single entrance on th street where they make their way through square foot m exhibits on their way up to the observatories guests were offered a variety of ticket packages including a package that enables them to skip the lines throughout the duration of their stay the empire state building garners significant revenue from ticket sales for its observation decks making more money from ticket sales than it does from renting office space during some years in early a motion simulator attraction was built on the nd floor as a complement to the observation deck the original cinematic presentation lasted approximately minutes while the simulation was about eight minutes the ride had two incarnations the original version which ran from until around featured james doohan star trek s scotty as the airplane s pilot who humorously tried to keep the flight under control during a storm after the september attacks in the ride was closed an updated version debuted in mid featuring actor kevin bacon as the pilot with the new flight also going haywire this new version served a more informative goal as opposed to the old version s main purpose of entertainment and contained details about the attacks the simulator received mixed reviews with assessments of the ride ranging from great to satisfactory to corny the final stage of the building was the installation of a hollow mast a foot m steel shaft fitted with elevators and utilities above the th floor at the top would be a conical roof and the nd floor docking station inside the elevators would ascend feet m from the th floor ticket offices to a foot wide m st floor f waiting room from there stairs would lead to the nd floor f where passengers would enter the airships the airships would have been moored to the spire at the equivalent of the building s th floor as constructed the mast contains four rectangular tiers topped by a cylindrical shaft with a conical pinnacle on the nd floor formerly the st floor there is a door with stairs ascending to the rd floor formerly the nd f this was built as a disembarkation floor for airships tethered to the building s spire and has a circular balcony outside it is now an access point to reach the spire for maintenance the room now contains electrical equipment but celebrities and dignitaries may also be given permission to take pictures there above the rd floor there is a set of stairs and a ladder to reach the spire for maintenance work the mast s windows were all replaced in the mast serves as the base of the building s broadcasting antenna broadcasting began at the empire state building on december when nbc and rca began transmitting experimental television broadcasts from a small antenna erected atop the mast with two separate transmitters for the visual and audio data they leased the th floor and built a laboratory there in rca was joined by edwin howard armstrong in a cooperative venture to test his fm system from the building s antenna this setup which entailed the installation of the world s first fm transmitter continued only until october of the next year due to disputes between rca and armstrong specifically nbc wanted to install more tv equipment in the room where armstrong s transmitter was located after some time the th floor became home to rca s new york television operations initially as experimental station w xbs channel then from as commercial station wnbt channel now wnbc channel nbc s fm station w xdg began transmitting from the antenna in nbc retained exclusive use of the top of the building until when the federal communications commission fcc ordered the exclusive deal be terminated the fcc directive was based on consumer complaints that a common location was necessary for the seven extant new york area television stations to transmit from so that receiving antennas would not have to be constantly adjusted other television broadcasters would later join rca at the building on the st through rd floors often along with sister fm stations construction of a dedicated broadcast tower began on july with tv and fm transmissions starting in the foot m broadcast tower was completed in from six broadcasters agreed to pay a combined per year for the use of the antenna in a separate set of fm antennae was constructed ringing the rd floor observation area to act as a master antenna the placement of the stations in the empire state building became a major issue with the construction of the world trade center s twin towers in the late s and early s the greater height of the twin towers would reflect radio waves broadcast from the empire state building eventually resulting in some broadcasters relocating to the newer towers instead of suing the developer the port authority of new york and new jersey even though the nine stations who were broadcasting from the empire state building were leasing their broadcast space until most of these stations moved to the world trade center as soon as it was completed in the broadcasters obtained a court order stipulating that the port authority had to build a mast and transmission equipment in the north tower as well as pay the broadcasters leases in the empire state building until only a few broadcasters renewed their leases in the empire state building the september attacks destroyed the world trade center and the broadcast centers atop it leaving most of the city s stations without a transmitter for ten days until the armstrong tower in alpine new jersey was re activated temporarily by october nearly all of the city s commercial broadcast stations both television and fm radio were again transmitting from the top of the empire state building in a report that congress commissioned about the transition from analog television to digital television it was stated that the placement of broadcast stations in the empire state building was considered problematic due to interference from nearby buildings in comparison the congressional report stated that the former twin towers had very few buildings of comparable height nearby thus signals suffered little interference in a few fm stations were relocated to the nearby cond nast building to reduce the number of broadcast stations using the empire state building eleven television stations and twenty two fm stations had signed year leases in the building by may it was expected that a taller broadcast tower in bayonne new jersey or governors island would be built in the meantime with the empire state building being used as a backup since signal transmissions from the building were generally of poorer quality following the construction of one world trade center in the late s and early s some tv stations began moving their transmitting facilities there as of update the empire state building is home to the following stations the site was previously owned by john jacob astor of the prominent astor family who had owned the site since the mid s in john jacob astor sr s grandson william waldorf astor opened the waldorf hotel on the site four years later his cousin john jacob astor iv opened the story astoria hotel on an adjacent site the two portions of the waldorf astoria hotel had bedrooms making it the largest hotel in the world at the time after the death of its founding proprietor george boldt in early the hotel lease was purchased by thomas coleman du pont by the s the old waldorf astoria was becoming dated and the elegant social life of new york had moved much farther north additionally many stores had opened on fifth avenue north of th street the astor family decided to build a replacement hotel on park avenue and sold the hotel to bethlehem engineering corporation in for million the hotel closed shortly thereafter on may bethlehem engineering corporation originally intended to build a story office building on the waldorf astoria site the company s president floyd de l brown paid of the million down payment required to start construction on the building with the promise that the difference would be paid later brown borrowed from a bank but defaulted on the loan after brown was unable to secure additional funding the land was resold to empire state inc a group of wealthy investors that included louis g kaufman ellis p earle john j raskob coleman du pont and pierre s du pont the name came from the state nickname for new york alfred e smith a former governor of new york and u s presidential candidate whose campaign had been managed by raskob was appointed head of the company the group also purchased nearby land so they would have the acres ha needed for the base with the combined plot measuring feet m wide by feet m long the empire state inc consortium was announced to the public in august concurrently smith announced the construction of an story building on the site to be taller than any other buildings in existence empire state inc contracted william f lamb of architectural firm shreve lamb and harmon to create the building design lamb produced the building drawings in just two weeks using the firm s earlier designs for the reynolds building in winston salem north carolina as the basis he had also been inspired by raymond hood s design for the daily news building which was being constructed at the same time concurrently lamb s partner richmond shreve created bug diagrams of the project requirements the zoning act forced lamb to design a structure that incorporated setbacks resulting in the lower floors being larger than the upper floors d consequently the building was designed from the top down giving it a pencil like shape the plans were devised within a budget of million and a stipulation that the building be ready for occupancy within months of the start of construction the original plan of the building was stories but was later increased to and then stories height restrictions were placed on nearby buildings to ensure that the top fifty floors of the planned story foot tall m building would have unobstructed views of the city the new york times lauded the site s proximity to mass transit with the brooklyn manhattan transit s th street station and the hudson and manhattan railroad s rd street terminal one block away as well as penn station two blocks away and grand central terminal nine blocks away at its closest it also praised the square feet m of proposed floor space near one of the busiest sections in the world the empire state building was to be a typical office building but raskob intended to build it better and in a bigger way according to architectural writer donald j reynolds while plans for the empire state building were being finalized an intense competition in new york for the title of world s tallest building was underway wall street then the bank of manhattan building and the chrysler building in manhattan both vied for this distinction and were already under construction when work began on the empire state building the race into the sky as popular media called it at the time was representative of the country s optimism in the s fueled by the building boom in major cities the race was defined by at least five other proposals although only the empire state building would survive the wall street crash of g the wall street tower was revised in april from feet m to feet m making it the world s tallest the chrysler building added its foot m steel tip to its roof in october thus bringing it to a height of feet m and greatly exceeding the height of wall street the chrysler building s developer walter chrysler realized that his tower s height would exceed the empire state building s as well having instructed his architect william van alen to change the chrysler s original roof from a stubby romanesque dome to a narrow steel spire raskob wishing to have the empire state building be the world s tallest reviewed the plans and had five floors added as well as a spire however the new floors would need to be set back because of projected wind pressure on the extension on november smith acquired a lot at west rd street adding feet m to the width of the proposed office building s site two days later smith announced the updated plans for the skyscraper the plans included an observation deck on the th floor roof at a height of feet m higher than the chrysler s st floor observation deck the foot empire state building would only be feet m taller than the chrysler building and raskob was afraid that chrysler might try to pull a trick like hiding a rod in the spire and then sticking it up at the last minute the plans were revised one last time in december to include a story foot m metal crown and an additional foot m mooring mast intended for dirigibles the roof height was now feet m making it the tallest building in the world by far even without the antenna the addition of the dirigible station meant that another floor the now enclosed th floor would have to be built below the crown however unlike the chrysler s spire the empire state s mast would serve a practical purpose a revised plan was announced to the public in late december just before the start of construction the final plan was sketched within two hours the night before the plan was supposed to be presented to the site s owners in january the new york times reported that the spire was facing some technical problems but they were no greater than might be expected under such a novel plan by this time the blueprints for the building had gone through up to fifteen versions before they were approved lamb described the other specifications he was given for the final approved plan the program was short enough a fixed budget no space more than feet from window to corridor as many stories of such space as possible an exterior of limestone and completion date of may which meant a year and six months from the beginning of sketches the contractors were starrett brothers and eken which were composed of paul and william a starrett and andrew j eken the project was financed primarily by raskob and pierre du pont while james farley s general builders supply corporation supplied the building materials john w bowser was the construction superintendent of the project and the structural engineer of the building was homer g balcom the tight completion schedule necessitated the commencement of construction even though the design had yet to be finalized demolition of the old waldorf astoria began on october stripping the building down was an arduous process as the hotel had been constructed using more rigid material than earlier buildings had been furthermore the old hotel s granite wood chips and precious metals such as lead brass and zinc were not in high demand resulting in issues with disposal most of the wood was deposited into a woodpile on nearby th street or was burned in a swamp elsewhere much of the other materials that made up the old hotel including the granite and bronze were dumped into the atlantic ocean near sandy hook new jersey by the time the hotel s demolition started raskob had secured the required funding for the construction of the building the plan was to start construction later that year but on october the new york stock exchange experienced the major and sudden wall street crash marking the beginning of the decade long great depression despite the economic downturn raskob refused to cancel the project because of the progress that had been made up to that point neither raskob who had ceased speculation in the stock market the previous year nor smith who had no stock investments suffered financially in the crash however most of the investors were affected and as a result in december empire state inc obtained a million loan from metropolitan life insurance company so construction could begin the stock market crash resulted in no demand for new office space raskob and smith nonetheless started construction as canceling the project would have resulted in greater losses for the investors a structural steel contract was awarded on january with excavation of the site beginning ten days later on january before the old hotel had been completely demolished two twelve hour shifts consisting of men each worked continuously to dig the foot m foundation small pier holes were sunk into the ground to house the concrete footings that would support the steelwork excavation was nearly complete by early march and construction on the building itself started on march with the builders placing the first steel columns on the completed footings before the rest of the footings had been finished around this time lamb held a press conference on the building plans he described the reflective steel panels parallel to the windows the large block indiana limestone facade that was slightly more expensive than smaller bricks and the building s vertical lines four colossal columns intended for installation in the center of the building site were delivered they would support a combined pounds kg when the building was finished the structural steel was pre ordered and pre fabricated in anticipation of a revision to the city s building code that would have allowed the empire state building s structural steel to carry pounds per square inch kpa up from pounds per square inch kpa thus reducing the amount of steel needed for the building although the psi regulation had been safely enacted in other cities mayor jimmy walker did not sign the new codes into law until march just before construction was due to commence the first steel framework was installed on april from there construction proceeded at a rapid pace during one stretch of working days the builders erected fourteen floors this was made possible through precise coordination of the building s planning as well as the mass production of common materials such as windows and spandrels on one occasion when a supplier could not provide timely delivery of dark hauteville marble starrett switched to using rose famosa marble from a german quarry that was purchased specifically to provide the project with sufficient marble the scale of the project was massive with trucks carrying partition tiles bags of cement cubic yards m of sand and bags of lime arriving at the construction site every day there were also cafes and concession stands on five of the incomplete floors so workers did not have to descend to the ground level to eat lunch temporary water taps were also built so workers did not waste time buying water bottles from the ground level additionally carts running on a small railway system transported materials from the basement storage to elevators that brought the carts to the desired floors where they would then be distributed throughout that level using another set of tracks the short tons long tons of steel ordered for the project was the largest ever single order of steel at the time comprising more steel than was ordered for the chrysler building and wall street combined according to historian john tauranac building materials were sourced from numerous and distant sources with limestone from indiana steel girders from pittsburgh cement and mortar from upper new york state marble from italy france and england wood from northern and pacific coast forests and hardware from new england the facade too used a variety of material most prominently indiana limestone but also swedish black granite terracotta and brick by june the skyscraper s supporting steel structure had risen to the th floor and by july half of the steel structure had been completed starrett bros and eken endeavored to build one floor a day in order to speed up construction a goal that they almost reached with their pace of stories per week prior to this the fastest pace of construction for a building of similar height had been stories per week while construction progressed the final designs for the floors were being designed from the ground up as opposed to the general design which had been from the roof down some of the levels were still undergoing final approval with several orders placed within an hour of a plan being finalized on september as steelwork was nearing completion smith laid the building s cornerstone during a ceremony attended by thousands the stone contained a box with contemporary artifacts including the previous day s new york times a u s currency set containing all denominations of notes and coins minted in a history of the site and building and photographs of the people involved in construction the steel structure was topped out at feet m on september twelve days ahead of schedule and weeks after the start of construction workers raised a flag atop the th floor to signify this milestone work on the building s interior and crowning mast commenced after the topping out the mooring mast topped out on november two months after the steelwork had been completed meanwhile work on the walls and interior was progressing at a quick pace with exterior walls built up to the th floor by the time steelwork had been built to the th floor the majority of the facade was already finished by the middle of november because of the building s height it was deemed infeasible to have many elevators or large elevator cabins so the builders contracted with the otis elevator company to make cars that could speed at feet per minute m min which represented the largest ever elevator order at the time in addition to the time constraint builders had there were also space limitations because construction materials had to be delivered quickly and trucks needed to drop off these materials without congesting traffic this was solved by creating a temporary driveway for the trucks between rd and th streets and then storing the materials in the building s first floor and basements concrete mixers brick hoppers and stone hoists inside the building ensured that materials would be able to ascend quickly and without endangering or inconveniencing the public at one point over trucks made material deliveries at the building site every day a series of relay and erection derricks placed on platforms erected near the building lifted the steel from the trucks below and installed the beams at the appropriate locations the empire state building was structurally completed on april twelve days ahead of schedule and days after construction commenced al smith shot the final rivet which was made of solid gold the project involved more than workers at its peak including on a single day august many of the workers were irish and italian immigrants with a sizable minority of mohawk ironworkers from the kahnawake reserve near montreal according to official accounts five workers died during the construction although the new york daily news gave reports of deaths and a headline in the socialist magazine the new masses spread unfounded rumors of up to deaths the empire state building cost to build equivalent to in including demolition of the waldorf astoria this was lower than the million budgeted for construction lewis hine captured many photographs of the construction documenting not only the work itself but also providing insight into the daily life of workers in that era hine s images were used extensively by the media to publish daily press releases according to the writer jim rasenberger hine climbed out onto the steel with the ironworkers and dangled from a derrick cable hundreds of feet above the city to capture as no one ever had before or has since the dizzy work of building skyscrapers in rasenberger s words hine turned what might have been an assignment of corporate flak into exhilarating art these images were later organized into their own collection onlookers were enraptured by the sheer height at which the steelworkers operated new york magazine wrote of the steelworkers like little spiders they toiled spinning a fabric of steel against the sky the empire state building officially opened on may forty five days ahead of its projected opening date and eighteen months from the start of construction the opening was marked with an event featuring united states president herbert hoover who turned on the building s lights with the ceremonial button push from washington d c over guests attended the opening ceremony and following luncheon at the th floor including jimmy walker governor franklin d roosevelt and al smith an account from that day stated that the view from the luncheon was obscured by a fog with other landmarks such as the statue of liberty being lost in the mist enveloping new york city the empire state building officially opened the next day advertisements for the building s observatories were placed in local newspapers while nearby hotels also capitalized on the events by releasing advertisements that lauded their proximity to the newly opened building according to the new york times builders and real estate speculators predicted that the foot tall m empire state building would be the world s tallest building for many years thus ending the great new york city skyscraper rivalry at the time most engineers agreed that it would be difficult to build a building taller than feet m even with the hardy manhattan bedrock as a foundation technically it was believed possible to build a tower of up to feet m but it was deemed uneconomical to do so especially during the great depression as the tallest building in the world at that time and the first one to exceed floors the empire state building became an icon of the city and ultimately of the nation in the fifth avenue association gave the building its gold medal for architectural excellence signifying that the empire state had been the best designed building on fifth avenue to open in a year later on march the movie king kong was released the movie which depicted a large stop motion ape named kong climbing the empire state building made the still new building into a cinematic icon at the beginning of fifth avenue was experiencing high demand for storefront space with only of stores being unoccupied the empire state building along with fifth avenue and fifth avenue were expected to add a combined stores the office space was less successful as the empire state building s opening had coincided with the great depression in the united states in the first year only percent of the available space was rented as compared to the early s where the average building would be percent occupied upon opening and percent occupied within five years the lack of renters led new yorkers to deride the building as the empty state building or smith s folly the earliest tenants in the empire state building were large companies banks and garment industries jack brod one of the building s longest resident tenants co established the empire diamond corporation with his father in the building in mid and rented space in the building until he died in brod recalled that there were only about tenants at the time of opening including him and that al smith was the only real tenant in the space above his seventh floor offices generally during the early s it was rare for more than a single office space to be rented in the building despite smith s and raskob s aggressive marketing efforts in the newspapers and to anyone they knew the building s lights were continuously left on even in the unrented spaces to give the impression of occupancy this was exacerbated by competition from rockefeller center as well as from buildings on nd street which when combined with the empire state building resulted in surplus of office space in a slow market during the s aggressive marketing efforts served to reinforce the empire state building s status as the world s tallest the observatory was advertised in local newspapers as well as on railroad tickets the building became a popular tourist attraction with one million people each paying one dollar to ride elevators to the observation decks in in its first year of operation the observation deck made approximately million in revenue as much as its owners made in rent that year by the observation deck was crowded on a daily basis with food and drink available for purchase at the top and by the building had received its five millionth visitor in nbc took up tenancy leasing space on the th floor for radio broadcasts from the outset the building was in debt losing million per year by real estate developer seymour durst recalled that the building was so underused in that there was no elevator service above the th floor as the building above the st floor was empty except for the nbc offices and the raskob du pont offices on the st floor per the original plans the empire state building s spire was intended to be an airship docking station raskob and smith had proposed dirigible ticketing offices and passenger waiting rooms on the th floor while the airships themselves would be tied to the spire at the equivalent of the building s th floor an elevator would ferry passengers from the th to the st floor f after they had checked in on the th floor after which passengers would have climbed steep ladders to board the airship the idea however was impractical and dangerous due to powerful updrafts caused by the building itself the wind currents across manhattan and the spires of nearby skyscrapers furthermore even if the airship were to successfully navigate all these obstacles its crew would have to jettison some ballast by releasing water onto the streets below in order to maintain stability and then tie the craft s nose to the spire with no mooring lines securing the tail end of the craft on september a small commercial united states navy airship circled times in mile per hour km h winds the airship then attempted to dock at the mast but its ballast spilled and the craft was rocked by unpredictable eddies the near disaster scuttled plans to turn the building s spire into an airship terminal although one blimp did manage to make a single newspaper delivery afterward on july a b mitchell bomber crashed into the north side of the empire state building between the th and th floors one engine completely penetrated the building and landed in a neighboring block while the other engine and part of the landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft fourteen people were killed in the incident but the building escaped severe damage and was reopened two days later by the s the empire state building was percent occupied the structure broke even for the first time in the s at the time mass transit options in the building s vicinity were limited compared to the present day despite this challenge the empire state building began to attract renters due to its reputation a foot m radio antenna was erected on top of the towers starting in allowing the area s television stations to be broadcast from the building despite the turnaround in the building s fortunes raskob listed it for sale in with a minimum asking price of million the property was purchased by business partners roger l stevens henry crown alfred r glancy and ben tobin the sale was brokered by the charles f noyes company a prominent real estate firm in upper manhattan for million the highest price paid for a single structure at the time by this time the empire state had been fully leased for several years with a waiting list of parties looking to lease space in the building according to the cortland standard that same year six news companies formed a partnership to pay a combined annual fee of to use the building s antenna which was completed in crown bought out his partners ownership stakes in becoming the sole owner the following year the american society of civil engineers named the building one of the seven modern civil engineering wonders in lawrence a wien signed a contract to purchase the empire state building for million with harry b helmsley acting as partners in the building s operating lease this became the new highest price for a single structure over people paid for one share each in a company called empire state building associates the company in turn subleased the building to another company headed by helmsley and wien raising million of the funds needed to pay the purchase price in a separate transaction the land underneath the building was sold to prudential insurance for million helmsley wien and peter malkin quickly started a program of minor improvement projects including the first ever full building facade refurbishment and window washing in the installation of new flood lights on the nd floor in and replacement of the manually operated elevators with automatic units in the little used western end of the second floor was used as a storage space until at which point it received escalators to the first floor as part of its conversion into a highly sought retail area in the same year that helmsley wien and malkin had purchased the empire state building the port authority of new york and new jersey formally backed plans for a new world trade center in lower manhattan the plan originally included story twin towers with column free open spaces the empire state s owners and real estate speculators were worried that the twin towers million square feet m of office space would create a glut of rentable space in manhattan as well as take away the empire state building s profits from lessees a revision in the world trade center s plan brought the twin towers to feet m each or stories taller than the empire state opponents of the new project included prominent real estate developer robert tishman as well as wien s committee for a reasonable world trade center in response to wien s opposition port authority executive director austin j tobin said that wien was only opposing the project because it would overshadow his empire state building as the world s tallest building the world trade center s twin towers started construction in the following year the ostankino tower succeeded the empire state building as the tallest freestanding structure in the world in the empire state surrendered its position as the world s tallest building when the world trade center s still under construction north tower surpassed it on october the north tower was topped out on december in december the observation deck was opened on the th floor of the twin towers significantly higher than the th floor observatory on the empire state building the latter was also losing revenue during this period particularly as a number of broadcast stations had moved to the world trade center in although the port authority continued to pay the broadcasting leases for the empire state until the empire state building was still seen as prestigious having seen its forty millionth visitor in march by there were nearly two million annual visitors although a building official had previously estimated between million and million annual visitors the building received its own zip code in may in a roll out of new postal codes in manhattan at the time its tenants collectively received pieces of mail daily the empire state building celebrated its th anniversary on may with a much publicized but poorly received laser light show as well as an empire state building week that ran through to may the new york city landmarks preservation commission voted to designate the building and its lobby as city landmarks on may citing the historic nature of the first and second floors as well as the fixtures and interior components of the upper floors the new york city planning commission endorsed the landmark status the building became a national historic landmark in in close alignment to the new york city landmarks report the empire state building was added to the national register of historic places the following year due to its architectural significance capital improvements were made to the empire state building during the early to mid s at a cost of million these improvements entailed replacing alarm systems elevators windows and air conditioning making the observation deck compliant with the americans with disabilities act of ada and refurbishing the limestone facade the observatory renovation was added after disability rights groups and the united states department of justice filed a lawsuit against the building in in what was the first lawsuit filed by an organization under the new law a settlement was reached in in which the empire state building associates agreed to add ada compliant elements such as new elevators ramps and automatic doors during its ongoing renovation prudential sold the land under the building in for million to a buyer representing hotelier hideki yokoi ja who was imprisoned at the time in connection with the deadly hotel new japan fire ja at the hotel new japan ja in tokyo in donald trump entered into a joint venture agreement with yokoi with a shared goal of breaking the empire state building s lease on the land in an effort to gain total ownership of the building so that if successful the two could reap the potential profits of merging the ownership of the building with the land beneath it having secured a half ownership of the land trump devised plans to take ownership of the building itself so he could renovate it even though helmsley and malkin had already started their refurbishment project he sued empire state building associates in february claiming that the latter had caused the building to become a high rise slum and a second rate rodent infested office tower trump had intended to have empire state building associates evicted for violating the terms of their lease but was denied this led to helmsley s companies countersuing trump in may this sparked a series of lawsuits and countersuits that lasted several years partly arising from trump s desire to obtain the building s master lease by taking it from empire state building associates upon harry helmsley s death in the malkins sued helmsley s widow leona helmsley for control of the building following the destruction of the world trade center during the september attacks in the empire state building again became the tallest building in new york city but was only the second tallest building in the americas after the sears later willis tower in chicago as a result of the attacks transmissions from nearly all of the city s commercial television and fm radio stations were again broadcast from the empire state building the attacks also led to an increase in security due to persistent terror threats against prominent sites in new york city in trump and yokoi sold their land claim to the empire state building associates now headed by malkin in a million sale this action merged the building s title and lease for the first time in half a century despite the lingering threat posed by the attacks the empire state building remained popular with million visitors to the observatories in compared to about million in even though she maintained her ownership stake in the building until the post consolidation ipo in october leona helmsley handed over day to day operations of the building in to peter malkin s company in the building was temporarily stolen by the new york daily news to show how easy it was to transfer the deed on a property since city clerks were not required to validate the submitted information as well as to help demonstrate how fraudulent deeds could be used to obtain large mortgages and then have individuals disappear with the money the paperwork submitted to the city included the names of fay wray the famous star of king kong and willie sutton a notorious new york bank robber the newspaper then transferred the deed back over to the legitimate owners who at that time were empire state land associates starting in the building s public areas received a million renovation with improvements to the air conditioning and waterproofing renovations to the observation deck and main lobby and relocation of the gift shop to the th floor about million was spent on improving the energy efficiency of the building with the goal of reducing energy emissions by within five years for example all of the windows were refurbished onsite into film coated superwindows which block heat but pass light air conditioning operating costs on hot days were reduced saving million of the project s capital cost immediately and partially funding some of the other retrofits the empire state building won the leadership in energy and environmental design leed gold for existing buildings rating in september as well as the world federation of great towers excellence in environment award for for the leed gold certification the building s energy reduction was considered as was a large purchase of carbon offsets other factors included low flow bathroom fixtures green cleaning supplies and use of recycled paper products on april one world trade center topped out taking the

june antennas on the mooring mast were removed or relocated to the upper mast while the aluminum panels were cleaned and coated with silver paint to minimize disruption to the observation decks the restoration work took place at night the project was completed by late the longest world record held by the empire state building was for the tallest skyscraper to structural height which it held for years until it was surpassed by the north tower of the world trade center in october the empire state building was also the tallest human made structure in the world before it was surpassed by the griffin television tower oklahoma kwtv mast in and the tallest freestanding structure in the world until the completion of the ostankino tower in an early s proposal to dismantle the spire and replace it with an additional floors which would have brought the building s height to feet m and made it once again the world s tallest at the time was considered but ultimately rejected with the destruction

landing gear plummeted down an elevator shaft causing a fire which was extinguished in minutes fourteen people were killed in the incident elevator operator betty lou oliver survived a plunge of stories inside an elevator which still stands as the guinness world record for the longest survived elevator fall recorded despite the damage and loss of life the building was open for business on many floors two days later the crash helped spur the passage of the long pending federal tort claims act of as well as the insertion of retroactive provisions into the law allowing people to sue the government for the incident also as a result of the crash the civil aeronautics administration enacted strict regulations regarding flying over new york city setting a minimum flying altitude of feet m above sea level regardless of the weather conditions a year later on july another aircraft narrowly missed striking the building the unidentified twin engine plane scraped past the observation deck scaring the tourists there on january an elevator in the building suddenly descended stories after a cable that controlled the cabin s maximum speed was severed the elevator fell from the th floor to the fourth floor where a narrowed elevator shaft provided a second safety system despite the floor fall both of the passengers in the cabin at the time were only slightly injured after the fall building inspectors reviewed all of the building s elevators because of the building s iconic status it and other midtown landmarks are popular locations for suicide attempts more than people have attempted suicide over the years by jumping from the upper parts of the building with most attempts being successful the first suicide from the building occurred on april before it was even completed when a carpenter who had been laid off went to the th floor and jumped the first suicide after the building s opening occurred from the th floor observatory in february when irma p eberhardt fell feet

an icon of the city and of the nation in time magazine noted that the empire state building seems to completely embody the city it has become synonymous with the historian john tauranac called it the twentieth century new york building despite the existence of taller and more modernist buildings early architectural critics also focused on the empire state building s exterior ornamentation architectural critic talbot hamlin wrote in that it is the world s tallest building is purely incidental george shepard chappell writing in the new yorker under the pseudonym t square wrote the same year that the empire state building had a palpably enormous appeal to the general public and that its difference and distinction lay in the extreme sensitiveness of its entire design however architectural critics also wrote negatively of the mast especially in light of its failure to become a real air terminal chappell called the mast a silly gesture and lewis mumford called it a public comfort station for migratory birds nevertheless architecture critic douglas haskell said the empire state building s appeal came from the fact that it was caught at the exact moment of transition caught between metal and stone between the idea of monumental mass and that of airy volume between handicraft and machine design and in the swing from what was essentially handicraft to what will be essentially industrial methods of fabrication early in the building s history travel companies such as short line motor coach service and new york central railroad used the building as an icon to symbolize the city after the construction of the first world trade center architect paul goldberger noted that the empire state building is famous for being tall but it is good enough to be famous for being good as an icon of the united states it is also very popular among americans in a survey the american institute of architects found that the empire state building was america s favorite building the building was originally a symbol of hope in a country devastated by the depression as well as a work of accomplishment by newer immigrants the writer benjamin flowers states that the empire state was a building intended to celebrate a new america built by men both clients and construction workers who were themselves new americans the architectural critic jonathan glancey refers to the building as an icon of american design in addition the new york new york hotel and casino in paradise nevada contains the empire tower a story replica of the empire state building in addition the new york new york hotel and casino in paradise nevada contains the chrysler tower a replica of the chrysler building measuring or stories tall a portion of the hotel s interior was also designed to resemble the empire state building s interior the empire state building has been hailed as an example of a wonder of the world due to the massive effort expended during construction the washington star listed it as part of one of the seven wonders of the modern world in while holiday magazine wrote in that the empire state s height would be taller than the combined heights of the eiffel tower and the great pyramid of giza the american society of civil engineers also declared the building a modern civil engineering wonder of the united states in and one of the seven wonders of the modern world in ron miller in a book also described the empire state building as one of the seven wonders of engineering it has often been called the eighth wonder of the world as well an appellation that it has held since shortly after opening the panels installed in the lobby in reflected this showing the seven original wonders alongside the empire state building the empire state building also became the standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures globally both natural and human made as an icon of new york city the empire state building has been featured in various films books tv shows and video games according to the building s official website more than movies contain depictions of the empire state building in his book about the building john tauranac writes that its first documented appearance in popular culture was swiss family manhattan a children s story by christopher morley a year later the film king kong depicted kong a large stop motion ape that climbs the empire state building bringing the building into the popular imagination later movies such as an affair to remember sleepless in seattle and independence day also prominently featured the building the building has also been featured in other works such as daleks in manhattan a episode of the tv series doctor who and empire an eight hour black and white silent film by andy warhol which

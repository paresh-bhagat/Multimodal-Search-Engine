 chichen itza nb was a large pre columbian city built by the maya people of the terminal classic period the archeological site is located in tin m municipality yucat n state mexico chichen itza was a major focal point in the northern maya lowlands from the late classic c ad through the terminal classic c ad and into the early portion of the postclassic period c ad the site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles reminiscent of styles seen in central mexico and of the puuc and chenes styles of the northern maya lowlands the presence of central mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central mexico but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion chichen itza was one of the largest maya cities and it was likely to have been one of the mythical great cities or tollans referred to in later mesoamerican literature the city may have had the most diverse population in the maya world a factor that could have contributed to the variety of architectural styles at the site the ruins of chichen itza are federal property and the site s stewardship is maintained by mexico s instituto nacional de antropolog a e historia national institute of anthropology and history the land under the monuments had been privately owned until march when it was purchased by the state of yucat n nb chichen itza is one of the most visited archeological sites in mexico with over million tourists in the maya name chichen itza means at the mouth of the well of the itza this derives from chi meaning mouth or edge and ch en or ch e en meaning well itz is the name of an ethnic lineage group that gained political and economic dominance of the northern peninsula one possible translation for itza is enchanter or enchantment of the water from its itz sorcerer and ha water the name is spelled chich n itz in spanish and the accents are sometimes maintained in other languages to show that both parts of the name are stressed on their final syllable other references prefer the maya orthography chich en itza pronounced t it en its this form preserves the phonemic distinction between ch and ch since the base word ch e en which however is not stressed in maya begins with a postalveolar ejective affricate consonant the word itza has a high tone on the a followed by a glottal stop indicated by the apostrophe citation needed evidence in the chilam balam books indicates another earlier name for this city prior to the arrival of the itza hegemony in northern yucat n while most sources agree the first word means seven there is considerable debate as to the correct translation of the rest this earlier name is difficult to define because of the absence of a single standard of orthography but it is represented variously as uuc yabnal seven great house uuc hab nal seven bushy places uucyabnal seven great rulers or uc abnal seven lines of abnal nb this name dating to the late classic period is recorded both in the book of chilam balam de chumayel and in hieroglyphic texts in the ruins chichen itza is located in the eastern portion of yucat n state in mexico the northern yucat n peninsula is karst and the rivers in the interior all run underground there are four visible natural sink holes called cenotes that could have provided plentiful water year round at chichen making it attractive for settlement of these cenotes the cenote sagrado or sacred cenote also variously known as the sacred well or well of sacrifice is the most famous in scientists determined that there is a hidden cenote under kukulkan which has never been seen by archeologists according to post conquest sources maya and spanish pre columbian maya sacrificed objects and human beings into the cenote as a form of worship to the maya rain god chaac edward herbert thompson dredged the cenote sagrado from to and recovered artifacts of gold jade pottery and incense as well as human remains a study of human remains taken from the cenote sagrado found that they had wounds consistent with human sacrifice several archeologists in the late s suggested that unlike previous maya polities of the early classic chichen itza may not have been governed by an individual ruler or a single dynastic lineage instead the city s political organization could have been structured by a multepal system which is characterized as rulership through council composed of members of elite ruling lineages this theory was popular in the s but in recent years the research that supported the concept of the multepal system has been called into question if not discredited the current belief trend in maya scholarship is toward the more traditional model of the maya kingdoms of the classic period southern lowlands in mexico chichen itza was a major economic power in the northern maya lowlands during its apogee participating in the water borne circum peninsular trade route through its port site of isla cerritos on the north coast chichen itza was able to obtain locally unavailable resources from distant areas such as obsidian from central mexico and gold from southern central america between ad and chichen itza expanded to become a powerful regional capital controlling north and central yucat n it established isla cerritos as a trading port the layout of chichen itza site core developed during its earlier phase of occupation between and ad its final layout was developed after ad and the th century saw the rise of the city as a regional capital controlling the area from central yucat n to the north coast with its power extending down the east and west coasts of the peninsula the earliest hieroglyphic date discovered at chichen itza is equivalent to ad while the last known date was recorded in the osario temple in the late classic city was centered upon the area to the southwest of the xtoloc cenote with the main architecture represented by the substructures now underlying the las monjas and observatorio and the basal platform upon which they were built chichen itza rose to regional prominence toward the end of the early classic period roughly ad it was however toward the end of the late classic and into the early part of the terminal classic that the site became a major regional capital centralizing and dominating political sociocultural economic and ideological life in the northern maya lowlands the ascension of chichen itza roughly correlates with the decline and fragmentation of the major centers of the southern maya lowlands as chichen itza rose to prominence the cities of yaxuna to the south and coba to the east were suffering decline these two cities had been mutual allies with yaxuna dependent upon coba at some point in the th century coba lost a significant portion of its territory isolating yaxuna and chichen itza may have directly contributed to the collapse of both cities according to some colonial mayan sources e g the book of chilam balam of chumayel hunac ceel ruler of mayapan conquered chichen itza in the th century hunac ceel supposedly prophesied his own rise to power according to custom at the time individuals thrown into the cenote sagrado were believed to have the power of prophecy if they survived during one such ceremony the chronicles state there were no survivors so hunac ceel leaped into the cenote sagrado and when removed prophesied his own ascension while there is some archeological evidence that indicates chich n itz was at one time looted and sacked there appears to be greater evidence that it could not have been by mayapan at least not when chich n itz was an active urban center archeological data now indicates that chichen itza declined as a regional center by before the rise of mayapan ongoing research at the site of mayapan may help resolve this chronological conundrum after chich n itz elite activities ceased the city may not have been abandoned when the spanish arrived they found a thriving local population although it is not clear from spanish sources if these maya were living in chichen itza proper or a nearby settlement the relatively high population density in the region was a factor in the conquistadors decision to locate a capital there according to post conquest sources both spanish and maya the cenote sagrado remained a place of pilgrimage in spanish conquistador francisco de montejo a veteran of the grijalva and cort s expeditions successfully petitioned the king of spain for a charter to conquer yucat n his first campaign in which covered much of the yucat n peninsula decimated his forces but ended with the establishment of a small fort at xaman ha south of what is today canc n montejo returned to yucat n in with reinforcements and established his main base at campeche on the west coast he sent his son francisco montejo the younger in late to conquer the interior of the yucat n peninsula from the north the objective from the beginning was to go to chich n itz and establish a capital montejo the younger eventually arrived at chichen itza which he renamed ciudad real at first he encountered no resistance and set about dividing the lands around the city and awarding them to his soldiers the maya became more hostile over time and eventually they laid siege to the spanish cutting off their supply line to the coast and forcing them to barricade themselves among the ruins of the ancient city months passed but no reinforcements arrived montejo the younger attempted an all out assault against the maya and lost of his remaining troops he was forced to abandon chich n itz in under cover of darkness by all spanish had been driven from the yucat n peninsula montejo eventually returned to yucat n and by recruiting maya from campeche and champoton built a large indio spanish army and conquered the peninsula the spanish crown later issued a land grant that included chichen itza and by it was a working cattle ranch chichen itza entered the popular imagination in with the book incidents of travel in yucatan by john lloyd stephens with illustrations by frederick catherwood the book recounted stephens visit to yucat n and his tour of maya cities including chich n itz the book prompted other explorations of the city in d sir charnay surveyed chich n itz and took numerous photographs that he published in cit s et ruines am ricaines visitors to chich n itz during the s and s came with photographic equipment and recorded more accurately the condition of several buildings in augustus le plongeon and his wife alice dixon le plongeon visited chich n and excavated a statue of a figure on its back knees drawn up upper torso raised on its elbows with a plate on its stomach augustus le plongeon called it chaacmol later renamed chac mool which has been the term to describe all types of this statuary found in mesoamerica teobert maler and alfred maudslay explored chich n in the s and both spent several weeks at the site and took extensive photographs maudslay published the first long form description of chichen itza in his book biologia centrali americana in the united states consul to yucat n edward herbert thompson purchased the hacienda chich n which included the ruins of chichen itza for years thompson explored the ancient city his discoveries included the earliest dated carving upon a lintel in the temple of the initial series and the excavation of several graves in the osario high priest s temple thompson is most famous for dredging the cenote sagrado sacred cenote from to where he recovered artifacts of gold copper and carved jade as well as the first ever examples of what were believed to be pre columbian maya cloth and wooden weapons thompson shipped the bulk of the artifacts to the peabody museum at harvard university in the carnegie institution accepted the proposal of archeologist sylvanus g morley and committed to conduct long term archeological research at chichen itza the mexican revolution and the following government instability as well as world war i delayed the project by a decade in the mexican government awarded the carnegie institution a year permit later extended another years to allow u s archeologists to conduct extensive excavation and restoration of chichen itza carnegie researchers excavated and restored the temple of warriors and the caracol among other major buildings at the same time the mexican government excavated and restored el castillo temple of kukulc n and the great ball court in the mexican government charged edward thompson with theft claiming he stole the artifacts from the cenote sagrado and smuggled them out of the country the government seized the hacienda chich n thompson who was in the united states at the time never returned to yucat n he wrote about his research and investigations of the maya culture in a book people of the serpent published in he died in new jersey in in the mexican supreme court ruled that thompson had broken no laws and returned chichen itza to his heirs the thompsons sold the hacienda to tourism pioneer fernando barbachano peon there have been two later expeditions to recover artifacts from the cenote sagrado in and the first was sponsored by the national geographic and the second by private interests both projects were supervised by mexico s national institute of anthropology and history inah inah has conducted an ongoing effort to excavate and restore other monuments in the archeological zone including the osario akab dzib and several buildings in chich n viejo old chichen in to investigate construction that predated el castillo yucatec archeologists began excavations adjacent to el castillo under the direction of rafael rach cobos chichen itza was one of the largest maya cities with the relatively densely clustered architecture of the site core covering an area of at least square kilometers sq mi smaller scale residential architecture extends for an unknown distance beyond this the city was built upon broken terrain which was artificially levelled in order to build the major architectural groups with the greatest effort being expended in the levelling of the areas for the castillo pyramid and the las monjas osario and main southwest groups the site contains many fine stone buildings in various states of preservation and many have been restored the buildings were connected by a dense network of paved causeways called sacbeob nb archeologists have identified over sacbeob criss crossing the site and extending in all directions from the city many of these stone buildings were originally painted in red green blue and purple colors pigments were chosen according to what was most easily available in the area the site must be imagined as a colorful one not like it is today just like gothic cathedrals in europe colors provided a greater sense of completeness and contributed greatly to the symbolic impact of the buildings the architecture encompasses a number of styles including the puuc and chenes styles of the northern yucat n peninsula the buildings of chichen itza are grouped in a series of architectonic sets and each set was at one time separated from the other by a series of low walls the three best known of these complexes are the great north platform which includes the monuments of the temple of kukulc n el castillo temple of warriors and the great ball court the osario group which includes the pyramid of the same name as well as the temple of xtoloc and the central group which includes the caracol las monjas and akab dzib south of las monjas in an area known as chich n viejo old chich n and only open to archeologists are several other complexes such as the group of the initial series group of the lintels and group of the old castle the puuc style architecture is concentrated in the old chichen area and also the earlier structures in the nunnery group including the las monjas annex and la iglesia buildings it is also represented in the akab dzib structure the puuc style building feature the usual mosaic decorated upper fa ades characteristic of the style but differ from the architecture of the puuc heartland in their block masonry walls as opposed to the fine veneers of the puuc region proper at least one structure in the las monjas group features an ornate fa ade and masked doorway that are typical examples of chenes style architecture a style centered upon a region in the north of campeche state lying between the puuc and r o bec regions those structures with sculpted hieroglyphic script are concentrated in certain areas of the site with the most important being the las monjas group dominating the north platform of chichen itza is the temple of kukulc n a maya feathered serpent deity similar to the aztec quetzalcoatl the temple was identified by the first spaniards to see it as el castillo the castle and it regularly is referred to as such this step pyramid stands about meters ft high and consists of a series of nine square terraces each approximately meters ft high with a meter ft high temple upon the summit the sides of the pyramid are approximately meters ft at the base and rise at an angle of although that varies slightly for each side the four faces of the pyramid have protruding stairways that rise at an angle of the talud walls of each terrace slant at an angle of between and at the base of the balustrades of the northeastern staircase are carved heads of a serpent mesoamerican cultures periodically superimposed larger structures over older ones and the temple of kukulc n is one such example in the mid s the mexican government sponsored an excavation of the temple after several false starts they discovered a staircase under the north side of the pyramid by digging from the top they found another temple buried below the current one inside the temple chamber was a chac mool statue and a throne in the shape of jaguar painted red and with spots made of inlaid jade the mexican government excavated a tunnel from the base of the north staircase up the earlier pyramid s stairway to the hidden temple and opened it to tourists in inah closed the throne room to the public around the spring and autumn equinoxes in the late afternoon the northwest corner of the pyramid casts a series of triangular shadows against the western balustrade on the north side that evokes the appearance of a serpent wriggling down the staircase which some scholars have suggested is a representation of the feathered serpent deity kukulc n it is a widespread belief that this light and shadow effect was achieved on purpose to record the equinoxes but the idea is highly unlikely it has been shown that the phenomenon can be observed without major changes during several weeks around the equinoxes making it impossible to determine any date by observing this effect alone archeologists have identified in chichen itza thirteen ballcourts for playing the mesoamerican ballgame but the great ball court about meters ft to the north west of the castillo is the most impressive it is the largest and best preserved ball court in ancient mesoamerica it measures by meters by ft the parallel platforms flanking the main playing area are each meters ft long the walls of these platforms stand meters ft high set high up in the center of each of these walls are rings carved with intertwined feathered serpents nb at the base of the high interior walls are slanted benches with sculpted panels of teams of ball players in one panel one of the players has been decapitated the wound emits streams of blood in the form of wriggling snakes at one end of the great ball court is the north temple also known as the temple of the bearded man templo del hombre barbado this small masonry building has detailed bas relief carving on the inner walls including a center figure that has carving under his chin that resembles facial hair at the south end is another much bigger temple but in ruins built into the east wall are the temples of the jaguar the upper temple of the jaguar overlooks the ball court and has an entrance guarded by two large columns carved in the familiar feathered serpent motif inside there is a large mural much destroyed which depicts a battle scene in the entrance to the lower temple of the jaguar which opens behind the ball court is another jaguar throne similar to the one in the inner temple of el castillo except that it is well worn and missing paint or other decoration the outer columns and the walls inside the temple are covered with elaborate bas relief carvings the tzompantli or skull platform plataforma de los cr neos shows the clear cultural influence of the central mexican plateau unlike the tzompantli of the highlands however the skulls were impaled vertically rather than horizontally as at tenochtitlan the platform of the eagles and the jaguars plataforma de guilas y jaguares is immediately to the east of the great ballcourt it is built in a combination maya and toltec styles with a staircase ascending each of its four sides the sides are decorated with panels depicting eagles and jaguars consuming human hearts this platform of venus is dedicated to the planet venus in its interior archeologists discovered a collection of large cones carved out of stone the purpose of which is unknown this platform is located north of el castillo between it and the cenote sagrado the temple of the tables is the northernmost of a series of buildings to the east of el castillo its name comes from a series of altars at the top of the structure that are supported by small carved figures of men with upraised arms called atlantes the steam bath is a unique building with three parts a waiting gallery a water bath and a steam chamber that operated by means of heated stones sacbe number one is a causeway that leads to the cenote sagrado is the largest and most elaborate at chichen itza this white road is meters ft long with an average width of meters ft it begins at a low wall a few meters from the platform of venus according to archeologists there once was an extensive building with columns at the beginning of the road the yucat n peninsula is a limestone plain with no rivers or streams the region is pockmarked with natural sinkholes called cenotes which expose the water table to the surface one of the most impressive of these is the cenote sagrado which is meters ft in diameter and surrounded by sheer cliffs that drop to the water table some meters ft below the cenote sagrado was a place of pilgrimage for ancient maya people who according to ethnohistoric sources would conduct sacrifices during times of drought archeological investigations support this as thousands of objects have been removed from the bottom of the cenote including material such as gold carved jade copal pottery flint obsidian shell wood rubber cloth as well as skeletons of children and men the temple of the warriors complex consists of a large stepped pyramid fronted and flanked by rows of carved columns depicting warriors this complex is analogous to temple b at the toltec capital of tula and indicates some form of cultural contact between the two regions the one at chichen itza however was constructed on a larger scale at the top of the stairway on the pyramid s summit and leading toward the entrance of the pyramid s temple is a chac mool this temple encases or entombs a former structure called the temple of the chac mool the archeological expedition and restoration of this building was done by the carnegie institution of washington from to a key member of this restoration was earl h morris who published the work from this expedition in two volumes entitled temple of the warriors watercolors were made of murals in the temple of the warriors that were deteriorating rapidly following exposure to the elements after enduring for centuries in the protected enclosures being discovered many depict battle scenes and some even have tantalizing images that lend themselves to speculation and debate by prominent maya scholars such as michael d coe and mary miller regarding possible contact with viking sailors along the south wall of the temple of warriors are a series of what are today exposed columns although when the city was inhabited these would have supported an extensive roof system the columns are in three distinct sections a west group that extends the lines of the front of the temple of warriors a north group runs along the south wall of the temple of warriors and contains pillars with carvings of soldiers in bas relief a northeast group which apparently formed a small temple at the southeast corner of the temple of warriors contains a rectangular decorated with carvings of people or gods as well as animals and serpents the northeast column temple also covers a small marvel of engineering a channel that funnels all the rainwater from the complex some meters ft away to a rejollada a former cenote to the south of the group of a thousand columns is a group of three smaller interconnected buildings the temple of the carved columns is a small elegant building that consists of a front gallery with an inner corridor that leads to an altar with a chac mool there are also numerous columns with rich bas relief carvings of some personages a section of the upper fa ade with a motif of x s and o s is displayed in front of the structure the temple of the small tables which is an unrestored mound and the thompson s temple referred to in some sources as palace of ahau balam kauil a small building with two levels that has friezes depicting jaguars balam in maya as well as glyphs of the maya god kahuil this square structure anchors the southern end of the temple of warriors complex it is so named for the shelf of stone that surrounds a large gallery and patio that early explorers theorized was used to display wares as in a marketplace today archeologists believe that its purpose was more ceremonial than commercial south of the north group is a smaller platform that has many important structures several of which appear to be oriented toward the second largest cenote at chichen itza xtoloc the osario itself like the temple of kukulkan is a step pyramid temple dominating its platform only on a smaller scale like its larger neighbor it has four sides with staircases on each side there is a temple on top but unlike kukulkan at the center is an opening into the pyramid that leads to a natural cave meters ft below edward h thompson excavated this cave in the late th century and because he found several skeletons and artifacts such as jade beads he named the structure the high priests temple archeologists today believe neither that the structure was a tomb nor that the personages buried in it were priests the temple of xtoloc is a recently restored temple outside the osario platform is it overlooks the other large cenote at chichen itza named after the maya word for iguana xtoloc the temple contains a series of pilasters carved with images of people as well as representations of plants birds and mythological scenes between the xtoloc temple and the osario are several aligned structures the platform of venus which is similar in design to the structure of the same name next to kukulkan el castillo the platform of the tombs and a small round structure that is unnamed these three structures were constructed in a row extending from the osario beyond them the osario platform terminates in a wall which contains an opening to a sacbe that runs several hundred feet to the xtoloc temple south of the osario at the boundary of the platform there are two small buildings that archeologists believe were residences for important personages these have been named as the house of the metates and the house of the mestizas south of the osario group is another small platform that has several structures that are among the oldest in the chichen itza archeological zone the casa colorada spanish for red house is one of the best preserved buildings at chichen itza its maya name is chichanchob which according to inah may mean small holes in one chamber there are extensive carved hieroglyphs that mention rulers of chichen itza and possibly of the nearby city of ek balam and contain a maya date inscribed which correlates to ad one of the oldest such dates found in all of chichen itza in inah restored a small ball court that adjoined the back wall of the casa colorada while the casa colorada is in a good state of preservation other buildings in the group with one exception are decrepit mounds one building is half standing named la casa del venado house of the deer this building s name has been long used by the local maya and some authors mention that it was named after a deer painting over stucco that doesn t exist anymore las monjas is one of the more notable structures at chichen itza it is a complex of terminal classic buildings constructed in the puuc architectural style the spanish named this complex las monjas the nuns or the nunnery but it was a governmental palace just to the east is a small temple known as the la iglesia the church decorated with elaborate masks the las monjas group is distinguished by its concentration of hieroglyphic texts dating to the late to terminal classic these texts frequently mention a ruler by the name of k ak upakal el caracol the snail is located to the north of las monjas it is a round building on a large square platform it gets its name from the stone spiral staircase inside the structure with its unusual placement on the platform and its round shape the others are rectangular in keeping with maya practice is theorized to have been a proto observatory with doors and windows aligned to astronomical events specifically around the path of venus as it traverses the heavens akab dzib is located to the east of the caracol the name means in yucatec mayan dark writing dark in the sense of mysterious an earlier name of the building according to a translation of glyphs in the casa colorada is wa k wak puh ak na the flat house with the excessive number of chambers and it was the home of the administrator of chich n itz kokom yahawal cho k ak inah completed a restoration of the building in it is relatively short only meters ft high and is meters ft in length and meters ft wide the long western facing fa ade has seven doorways the eastern fa ade has only four doorways broken by a large staircase that leads to the roof this apparently was the front of the structure and looks out over what is today a steep dry cenote the southern end of the building has one entrance the door opens into a small chamber and on the opposite wall is another doorway above which on the lintel are intricately carved glyphs the mysterious or obscure writing that gives the building its name today under the lintel in the doorjamb is another carved panel of a seated figure surrounded by more glyphs inside one of the chambers near the ceiling is a painted hand print old chichen or chich n viejo in spanish is the name given to a group of structures to the south of the central site where most of the puuc style architecture of the city is concentrated it includes the initial series group the phallic temple the platform of the great turtle the temple of the owls and the temple of the monkeys chichen itza also has a variety of other structures densely packed in the ceremonial center of about square kilometers sq mi and several outlying subsidiary sites approximately km mi south east of the chichen itza archeological zone are a network of sacred caves known as balankanche spanish gruta de balankanche balamka anche in yucatec maya in the caves a large selection of ancient pottery and idols may be seen still in the positions where they were left in pre columbian times the location of the cave has been well known in modern times edward thompson and alfred tozzer visited it in a s pearse and a team of biologists explored the cave in and e wyllys andrews iv also explored the cave in the s edwin shook and r e smith explored the cave on behalf of the carnegie institution in and dug several trenches to recover potsherds and other artifacts shook determined that the cave had been inhabited over a long period at least from the preclassic to the post conquest era on september jos humberto g mez a local guide discovered a false wall in the cave behind it he found an extended network of caves with significant quantities of undisturbed archeological remains including pottery and stone carved censers stone implements and jewelry inah converted the cave into an underground museum and the objects after being catalogued were returned to their original place so visitors can see them in situ chichen itza is one of the most visited archeological sites in mexico in it was estimated to have received million visitors tourism has been a factor at chichen itza for more than a century john lloyd stephens who popularized the maya yucat n in the public s imagination with his book incidents of travel in yucatan inspired many to make a pilgrimage to chich n itz even before the book was published benjamin norman and baron emanuel von friedrichsthal traveled to chichen after meeting stephens and both published the results of what they found friedrichsthal was the first to photograph chichen itza using the recently invented daguerreotype after edward thompson in purchased the hacienda chich n which included chichen itza he received a constant stream of visitors in he announced his intention to construct a hotel on his property but abandoned those plans probably because of the mexican revolution in the early s a group of yucatecans led by writer photographer francisco gomez rul began working toward expanding tourism to yucat n they urged governor felipe carrillo puerto to build roads to the more famous monuments including chichen itza in governor carrillo puerto officially opened the highway to chichen itza gomez rul published one of the first guidebooks to yucat n and the ruins gomez rul s son in law fernando barbachano peon a grandnephew of former yucat n governor miguel barbachano started yucat n s first official tourism business in the early s he began by meeting passengers who arrived by steamship at progreso the port north of m rida and persuading them to spend a week in yucat n after which they would catch the next steamship to their next destination in his first year barbachano peon reportedly was only able to convince seven passengers to leave the ship and join him on a tour in the mid s barbachano peon persuaded edward thompson to sell acres m next to chichen for a hotel in the mayaland hotel opened just north of the hacienda chich n which had been taken over by the carnegie institution in barbachano peon purchased all of the hacienda chich n including chichen itza from the heirs of edward thompson around that same time the carnegie institution completed its work at chichen itza and abandoned the hacienda chich n which barbachano turned into another seasonal hotel in mexico enacted the ley federal sobre monumentos y zonas arqueol gicas art sticas e hist ricas federal law over monuments and archeological artistic and historic sites that put all the nation s pre columbian monuments including those at chichen itza under federal ownership there were now hundreds if not thousands of visitors every year to chichen itza and more were expected with the development of the canc n resort area to the east in the s chichen itza began to receive an influx of visitors on the day of the spring equinox today several thousand show up to see the light and shadow effect on the temple of kukulc n during which the feathered serpent appears to crawl down the side of the pyramid nb tour guides will also

tourist resort of canc n who make a day trip on tour buses in chichen itza s temple of kukulc n el castillo was named one of the new seven wonders of the world after a worldwide vote despite the fact that the vote was sponsored by a commercial enterprise and that its methodology was criticized the vote was embraced by government and tourism officials in mexico who projected that as a result of the publicity the number of tourists to chichen would double by nb the ensuing publicity re ignited debate in mexico over the ownership of the site which culminated on march when the state of yucat n purchased the land upon which the most recognized monuments rest from owner hans juergen thies barbachano inah which manages the site has closed a number of monuments to public access while visitors can walk around them they can no longer climb them or go inside their chambers climbing access to el castillo was closed after a san diego california woman fell to her death in el caracol observatory

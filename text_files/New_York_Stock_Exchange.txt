the beginning and the end of each trading day the opening bell is rung at am et to mark the start of the day s trading session at pm et the closing bell is rung and trading for the day stops there are bells located in each of the four main sections of the nyse that all ring at the same time once a button is pressed there are three buttons that control the bells located on the control panel behind

stroke bell that is used to signal a moment of silence a third red button controls a backup bell which is used in case the main bell fails to ring the signal to start and stop trading was not always a bell the original signal was a gavel which is still in use today along with the bell but during the late s the nyse decided to switch the gavel for a gong to signal the day s beginning and end after the nyse changed to its present location at broad street in the gong was switched to the bell format that is currently being used a common sight today is the highly publicized events in which a celebrity or executive from a corporation stands behind the nyse podium and pushes the button that signals the bells to ring due to the amount of coverage that the opening closing bells receive many companies coordinate new product launches and other marketing related events to start on the same day as when the company s representatives ring the bell it was only in that the nyse began having special guests ring the bells on a regular basis prior to that ringing the bells was usually the responsibility of the exchange s floor managers many of the people who ring the bell are business executives whose companies trade on the exchange however there have also been many famous people from outside the world of business that have rung the bell athletes such as joe dimaggio of the new york yankees and olympic swimming champion michael phelps entertainers such as rapper snoop dogg members of espn s college gameday crew singer and actress liza minnelli and members of the band kiss

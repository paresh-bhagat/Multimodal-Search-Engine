 the lighthouse of alexandria sometimes called the pharos of alexandria f r s ancient greek contemporary koine greek pronunciation ho p ros t s a lek sandr a s was a lighthouse built by the ptolemaic kingdom of ancient egypt during the reign of ptolemy ii philadelphus bc it has been estimated to have been at least metres ft in overall height one of the seven wonders of the ancient world for many centuries it was one of the tallest man made structures in the world the lighthouse was severely damaged by three earthquakes between and ad and became an abandoned ruin it was the third longest surviving ancient wonder after the mausoleum at halicarnassus and the extant great pyramid of giza surviving in part until when the last of its remnant stones were used to build the citadel of qaitbay on the site in a team of french archaeologists dove into the water of alexandria s eastern harbour and discovered some remains of the lighthouse on the sea floor in the ministry of state of antiquities in egypt had plans to turn submerged ruins of ancient alexandria including those of the pharos into an underwater museum pharos was a small island located on the western edge of the nile delta in bc alexander the great founded the city of alexandria on an isthmus opposite pharos alexandria and pharos were later connected by a mole spanning more than metres miles which was called the heptastadion seven stadia a stadion was a greek unit of length measuring approximately m the etymology of pharos is uncertain the word became generalized in modern greek f ros and was loaned into spanish faro the east side of the mole became the great harbour now an open bay on the west side lay the port of eunostos with its inner basin kibotos now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbour today s city development lying between the present grand square and the modern ras el tin quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole the ras el tin promontory where ras el tin palace was built in the th century represents all that is left of the island of pharos the site of the lighthouse at its eastern point having been weathered away by the sea the lighthouse was constructed in the third century bc after alexander the great died the first ptolemy ptolemy i soter declared himself king in bc and commissioned its construction shortly thereafter the building was finished during the reign of his son ptolemy ii philadelphus and took twelve years to complete at a total cost of talents of silver the light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was said to have been built mostly with solid blocks of limestone and granite in his encyclopedic manuscript geographica strabo who visited alexandria in the late first century bc reported that sostratus of cnidus had a dedication to the saviour gods inscribed in metal letters on the lighthouse writing in the first century ad pliny the elder stated in his natural history that sostratus was the architect although this conclusion is disputed in his second century ad educational treatise how to write history lucian claimed that sostratus hid his name under plaster which bore the name of ptolemy so that when the plaster eventually fell off sostratus s name would be visible in the stone the blocks of sandstone and limestone used in the construction of the lighthouse have been scientifically analysed in order to discover where they originated with mineralogical and chemical analysis pointing to the wadi hammamat quarries which are located in the desert to the east of alexandria arab descriptions of the lighthouse are consistent despite it undergoing several repairs after earthquake damage given heights vary only fifteen percent from to m to ft on a by m by ft square base the arab authors indicate that the lighthouse was constructed from large blocks of light coloured stone the tower was made up of three tapering tiers a lower square section with a central core a middle octagonal section and at the top a circular section al masudi wrote in the th century that the seaward facing side featured an inscription dedicated to zeus geographer al idrisi visited the lighthouse in and noted openings in the walls throughout the rectangular shaft with lead used as a filling agent in between the masonry blocks at the base he reckoned the total height of the lighthouse to be dhira rashashl m at its apex was a mirror which reflected sunlight during the day a fire was lit at night extant roman coins struck by the alexandrian mint show that a statue of triton was positioned on each of the building s four corners and a statue of poseidon or zeus stood atop the fullest description of the lighthouse comes from arab traveler abou haggag youssef ibn mohammed el balawi el andaloussi who visited alexandria in ad balawi provided description and measurement of the interior of the lighthouse s rectangular shaft the inner ramp was described as roofed with masonry at shibr cm ft noted as to allow two horsemen to pass at once in clockwise rotation the ramp held four stories with eighteen fourteen and seventeen rooms on the second third and fourth floors respectively balawi accounted the base of the lighthouse to be ba m ft long on each side with connecting ramp dhira m ft long by dhira m ft wide the octangle section is accounted at ba m ft in width and the diameter of the cylindrical section is accounted at ba m ft the apex of the lighthouse s oratory was measured with diameter ba m ft late accounts of the lighthouse after the destruction by the crete earthquake include ibn battuta a moroccan scholar and explorer who passed through alexandria in and battuta noted that the wrecked condition of the lighthouse was then only noticeable by the rectangle tower and entrance ramp he stated the tower to be shibr m ft on either side battuta detailed sultan an nasir muhammad s plan to build a new lighthouse near the site of the collapsed one but these went unfulfilled after the sultan s death in the lighthouse was partially cracked and damaged by earthquakes in and followed by structural collapse in the earthquake of and then again in and earthquakes propagate from two well known tectonic boundaries the african arabian and red sea rift zones respectively and km from the lighthouse s location documentation shows the earthquake to be the first to cause structural collapse of the top metres of the construction documented repairs after the earthquake include the installment of an islamic style dome after the collapse of the statue that previously topped the monument the most destructive earthquake in was an estimated intensity of viii originating from the greek island of crete km from alexandria finally the stubby remnant disappeared in when the then sultan of egypt qaitbay built a medieval fort on the larger platform of the lighthouse site using some of the fallen stone the th century writer al mas udi reports a legendary tale on the lighthouse s destruction according to which at the time of caliph abd al malik ibn marwan r the byzantines sent a eunuch agent who adopted islam gained the caliph s confidence and secured permission to search for hidden treasure at the base of the lighthouse the search was cunningly made in such a manner that the foundations were undermined and the pharos collapsed the agent managed to escape in a ship waiting for him gaston jondet made in the first detailed description of the submerged ruins of the old port of alexandria he was followed by raymond weill in the same year and by sir leopold halliday savile in in the lighthouse was rediscovered unesco sponsored an expedition to send a team of marine archaeologists led by honor frost to the site she confirmed the existence of ruins representing part of the lighthouse due to the lack of specialized archaeologists and the area becoming a military zone exploration was put on hold a team of french archaeologists led by jean yves empereur re discovered the physical remains of the lighthouse in late on the floor of alexandria s eastern harbour he worked with cinematographer asma el bakri who used a mm camera to capture the first underwater pictures of the scattered remains of collapsed columns and statues empereur s most significant findings consisted of blocks of granite tonnes in mass often broken into multiple pieces sphinxes obelisks and columns with carvings dating back to ramses ii bc the cataloging of over pieces was completed by empereur and his team at the end of using a combination of photography and mapping thirty six pieces of empereur s granite blocks and other discoveries have been restored and are currently on display in alexandria museums subsequent satellite imaging has revealed further remains in the early s the underwater archaeologist franck goddio began exploration at the opposite side of the harbor from where empereur s team had worked subsequent satellite and sonar imaging has revealed the additional remains of wharves houses and temples which had all fallen into the mediterranean sea as a result of earthquakes and other natural disasters it is possible to go diving and see the ruins the secretariat of the unesco convention on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage is currently working with the government of egypt on an initiative to add the bay of alexandria including the remains of the lighthouse to a world heritage list of submerged cultural sites legend has it that the people of the island of pharos were wreckers hence ptolemy i soter had the lighthouse built to help guide ships into port at night pharos became the etymological origin of the word lighthouse in greek many romance languages such as french phare italian and spanish faro and thence into esperanto faro catalan romanian far and portuguese farol as well as swedish and danish fyr and even some slavic languages like bulgarian far in french portuguese turkish serbian and russian a derived word means headlight phare farol far since a number of proposals have been made to replace the lighthouse with a modern reconstruction in the egyptian government and the alexandria governorate suggested building a skyscraper on the site of the lighthouse as part of the regeneration of the eastern harbour of alexandria port the lighthouse remains a civic symbol of the city of alexandria and of the alexandria governorate with which the city is more or less coterminous a stylised representation of the lighthouse appears on the flag and seal of the governorate and on many public services of the city including the seal of alexandria university now because of the narrowness of the strait there can be no access by ship to the harbour without the consent of those who hold the pharos in view of this caesar took the precaution of landing his troops while the enemy was preoccupied with fighting seized the pharos and posted a garrison there the result was that safe access was secured for his corn supplies and reinforcements notes after he sostratus had built the work he wrote his name on the masonry inside covered it with gypsum and having hidden it inscribed the name of the reigning king he knew as actually happened that in a very short time the letters would fall away with the plaster and there would be revealed sostratus of cnidos the son of dexiphanes to the divine saviours for the sake of them that sail at sea thus not even he had regard for the immediate moment or his own brief lifetime he looked to our day and eternity as long as the tower shall stand and his skill abide history then should be written in that spirit with truthfulness and an eye to future expectations rather than with adulation and a view to the pleasure of present praise

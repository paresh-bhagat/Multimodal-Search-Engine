 the statue of liberty liberty enlightening the world french la libert clairant le monde is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on liberty island in new york harbor in new york city in the united states the copper statue a gift from the people of france was designed by french sculptor fr d ric auguste bartholdi and its metal framework was built by gustave eiffel the statue was dedicated on october the statue is a figure of libertas a robed roman liberty goddess she holds a torch above her head with her right hand and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed july iv mdcclxxvi july in roman numerals the date of the u s declaration of independence a broken shackle and chain lie at her feet as she walks forward commemorating the recent national abolition of slavery after its dedication the statue became an icon of freedom and of the united states seen as a symbol of welcome to immigrants arriving by sea bartholdi was inspired by a french law professor and politician douard ren de laboulaye who is said to have commented in that any monument raised to u s independence would properly be a joint project of the french and american peoples the franco prussian war delayed progress until when laboulaye proposed that the french finance the statue and the united states provide the site and build the pedestal bartholdi completed the head and the torch bearing arm before the statue was fully designed and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions the torch bearing arm was displayed at the centennial exposition in philadelphia in and in madison square park in manhattan from to fundraising proved difficult especially for the americans and by work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds publisher joseph pulitzer of the new york world started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than contributors most of whom gave less than a dollar equivalent to in the statue was built in france shipped overseas in crates and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called bedloe s island the statue s completion was marked by new york s first ticker tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by president grover cleveland the statue was administered by the united states lighthouse board until and then by the department of war since it has been maintained by the national park service as part of the statue of liberty national monument and is a major tourist attraction public access to the balcony around the torch has been barred since according to the national park service the idea of a monument presented by the french people to the united states was first proposed by douard ren de laboulaye president of the french anti slavery society and a prominent and important political thinker of his time the project is traced to a mid conversation between laboulaye a staunch abolitionist and fr d ric bartholdi a sculptor in after dinner conversation at his home near versailles laboulaye an ardent supporter of the union in the american civil war is supposed to have said if a monument should rise in the united states as a memorial to their independence i should think it only natural if it were built by united effort a common work of both our nations the national park service in a report however deemed this a legend traced to an fundraising pamphlet and that the statue was most likely conceived in in another essay on their website the park service suggested that laboulaye was minded to honor the union victory and its consequences with the abolition of slavery and the union s victory in the civil war in laboulaye s wishes of freedom and democracy were turning into a reality in the united states in order to honor these achievements laboulaye proposed that a gift be built for the united states on behalf of france laboulaye hoped that by calling attention to the recent achievements of the united states the french people would be inspired to call for their own democracy in the face of a repressive monarchy according to sculptor fr d ric auguste bartholdi who later recounted the story laboulaye s alleged comment was not intended as a proposal but it inspired bartholdi given the repressive nature of the regime of napoleon iii bartholdi took no immediate action on the idea except to discuss it with laboulaye bartholdi was in any event busy with other possible projects in the late s he approached isma il pasha khedive of egypt with a plan to build progress or egypt carrying the light to asia a huge lighthouse in the form of an ancient egyptian female fellah or peasant robed and holding a torch aloft at the northern entrance to the suez canal in port said sketches and models were made of the proposed work though it was never erected there was a classical precedent for the suez proposal the colossus of rhodes an ancient bronze statue of the greek god of the sun helios this statue is believed to have been over feet m high and it similarly stood at a harbor entrance and carried a light to guide ships both the khedive and lesseps declined the proposed statue from bartholdi citing the expensive cost the port said lighthouse was built instead by fran ois coignet in any large project was further delayed by the franco prussian war in which bartholdi served as a major of militia in the war napoleon iii was captured and deposed bartholdi s home province of alsace was lost to the prussians and a more liberal republic was installed in france as bartholdi had been planning a trip to the united states he and laboulaye decided the time was right to discuss the idea with influential americans in june bartholdi crossed the atlantic with letters of introduction signed by laboulaye arriving at new york harbor bartholdi focused on bedloe s island now named liberty island as a site for the statue struck by the fact that vessels arriving in new york had to sail past it he was delighted to learn that the island was owned by the united states government it had been ceded by the new york state legislature in for harbor defense it was thus as he put it in a letter to laboulaye land common to all the states as well as meeting many influential new yorkers bartholdi visited president ulysses s grant who assured him that it would not be difficult to obtain the site for the statue bartholdi crossed the united states twice by rail and met many americans who he thought would be sympathetic to the project but he remained concerned that popular opinion on both sides of the atlantic was insufficiently supportive of the proposal and he and laboulaye decided to wait before mounting a public campaign bartholdi had made a first model of his concept in the son of a friend of bartholdi s artist john lafarge later maintained that bartholdi made the first sketches for the statue during his visit to la farge s rhode island studio bartholdi continued to develop the concept following his return to france he also worked on a number of sculptures designed to bolster french patriotism after the defeat by the prussians one of these was the lion of belfort a monumental sculpture carved in sandstone below the fortress of belfort which during the war had resisted a prussian siege for over three months the defiant lion feet m long and half that in height displays an emotional quality characteristic of romanticism which bartholdi would later bring to the statue of liberty bartholdi and laboulaye considered how best to express the idea of american liberty in early american history two female figures were frequently used as cultural symbols of the nation one of these symbols the personified columbia was seen as an embodiment of the united states in the manner that britannia was identified with the united kingdom and marianne came to represent france columbia had supplanted the traditional european personification of the americas as an indian princess which had come to be regarded as uncivilized and derogatory toward americans the other significant female icon in american culture was a representation of liberty derived from libertas the goddess of freedom widely worshipped in ancient rome especially among emancipated slaves a liberty figure adorned most american coins of the time and representations of liberty appeared in popular and civic art including thomas crawford s statue of freedom atop the dome of the united states capitol building the statue s design evokes iconography evident in ancient history including the egyptian goddess isis the ancient greek deity of the same name the roman columbia and the christian iconography of the virgin mary artists of the th and th centuries striving to evoke republican ideals commonly used representations of libertas as an allegorical symbol a figure of liberty was also depicted on the great seal of france however bartholdi and laboulaye avoided an image of revolutionary liberty such as that depicted in eug ne delacroix s famed liberty leading the people in this painting which commemorates france s july revolution a half clothed liberty leads an armed mob over the bodies of the fallen laboulaye had no sympathy for revolution and so bartholdi s figure would be fully dressed in flowing robes instead of the impression of violence in the delacroix work bartholdi wished to give the statue a peaceful appearance and chose a torch representing progress for the figure to hold crawford s statue was designed in the early s it was originally to be crowned with a pileus the cap given to emancipated slaves in ancient rome secretary of war jefferson davis a southerner who would later serve as president of the confederate states of america was concerned that the pileus would be taken as an abolitionist symbol he ordered that it be changed to a helmet delacroix s figure wears a pileus and bartholdi at first considered placing one on his figure as well instead he used a radiate diadem or crown to top its head in so doing he avoided a reference to marianne who invariably wears a pileus the seven rays form a halo or aureole they evoke the sun the seven seas and the seven continents and represent another means besides the torch whereby liberty enlightens the world bartholdi s early models were all similar in concept a female figure in neoclassical style representing liberty wearing a stola and pella gown and cloak common in depictions of roman goddesses and holding a torch aloft according to popular accounts the face was modeled after that of charlotte beysser bartholdi the sculptor s mother but regis huber the curator of the bartholdi museum is on record as saying that this as well as other similar speculations have no basis in fact he designed the figure with a strong uncomplicated silhouette which would be set off well by its dramatic harbor placement and allow passengers on vessels entering new york bay to experience a changing perspective on the statue as they proceeded toward manhattan he gave it bold classical contours and applied simplified modeling reflecting the huge scale of the project and its solemn purpose bartholdi wrote of his technique the surfaces should be broad and simple defined by a bold and clear design accentuated in the important places the enlargement of the details or their multiplicity is to be feared by exaggerating the forms in order to render them more clearly visible or by enriching them with details we would destroy the proportion of the work finally the model like the design should have a summarized character such as one would give to a rapid sketch only it is necessary that this character should be the product of volition and study and that the artist concentrating his knowledge should find the form and the line in its greatest simplicity bartholdi made alterations in the design as the project evolved bartholdi considered having liberty hold a broken chain but decided this would be too divisive in the days after the civil war the erected statue does stride over a broken chain half hidden by her robes and difficult to see from the ground bartholdi was initially uncertain of what to place in liberty s left hand he settled on a tabula ansata used to evoke the concept of law though bartholdi greatly admired the united states constitution he chose to inscribe july iv mdcclxxvi on the tablet thus associating the date of the country s declaration of independence with the concept of liberty bartholdi interested his friend and mentor architect eug ne viollet le duc in the project as chief engineer viollet le duc designed a brick pier within the statue to which the skin would be anchored after consultations with the metalwork foundry gaget gauthier co viollet le duc chose the metal which would be used for the skin copper sheets and the method used to shape it repouss in which the sheets were heated and then struck with wooden hammers an advantage of this choice was that the entire statue would be light for its volume as the copper need be only inches mm thick bartholdi had decided on a height of just over feet m for the statue double that of italy s sancarlone and the german statue of arminius both made with the same method by france was enjoying improved political stability and a recovering postwar economy growing interest in the upcoming centennial exposition in philadelphia led laboulaye to decide it was time to seek public support in september he announced the project and the formation of the franco american union as its fundraising arm with the announcement the statue was given a name liberty enlightening the world the french would finance the statue americans would be expected to pay for the pedestal the announcement provoked a generally favorable reaction in france though many frenchmen resented the united states for not coming to their aid during the war with prussia french monarchists opposed the statue if for no other reason than it was proposed by the liberal laboulaye who had recently been elected a senator for life laboulaye arranged events designed to appeal to the rich and powerful including a special performance at the paris opera on april that featured a new cantata by composer charles gounod the piece was titled la libert clairant le monde the french version of the statue s announced name initially focused on the elites the union was successful in raising funds from across french society schoolchildren and ordinary citizens gave as did french municipalities laboulaye s political allies supported the call as did descendants of the french contingent in the american revolutionary war less idealistically contributions came from those who hoped for american support in the french attempt to build the panama canal the copper may have come from multiple sources and some of it is said to have come from a mine in visnes norway though this has not been conclusively determined after testing samples according to cara sutherland in her book on the statue for the museum of the city of new york pounds kg was needed to build the statue and the french copper industrialist eug ne secr tan donated pounds kg of copper although plans for the statue had not been finalized bartholdi moved forward with fabrication of the right arm bearing the torch and the head work began at the gaget gauthier co workshop in may bartholdi traveled to the united states as a member of a french delegation to the centennial exhibition and arranged for a huge painting of the statue to be shown in new york as part of the centennial festivities the arm did not arrive in philadelphia until august because of its late arrival it was not listed in the exhibition catalogue and while some reports correctly identified the work others called it the colossal arm or bartholdi electric light the exhibition grounds contained a number of monumental artworks to compete for fairgoers interest including an outsized fountain designed by bartholdi nevertheless the arm proved popular in the exhibition s waning days and visitors would climb up to the balcony of the torch to view the fairgrounds after the exhibition closed the arm was transported to new york where it remained on display in madison square park for several years before it was returned to france to join the rest of the statue during his second trip to the united states bartholdi addressed a number of groups about the project and urged the formation of american committees of the franco american union committees to raise money to pay for the foundation and pedestal were formed in new york boston and philadelphia the new york group eventually took on most of the responsibility for american fundraising and is often referred to as the american committee one of its members was year old theodore roosevelt the future governor of new york and president of the united states on march on his final full day in office president grant signed a joint resolution that authorized the president to accept the statue when it was presented by france and to select a site for it president rutherford b hayes who took office the following day selected the bedloe s island site that bartholdi had proposed on his return to paris in bartholdi concentrated on completing the head which was exhibited at the paris world s fair fundraising continued with models of the statue put on sale tickets to view the construction activity at the gaget gauthier co workshop were also offered the french government authorized a lottery among the prizes were valuable silver plate and a terracotta model of the statue by the end of about francs had been raised the head and arm had been built with assistance from viollet le duc who fell ill in he soon died leaving no indication of how he intended to transition from the copper skin to his proposed masonry pier the following year bartholdi was able to obtain the services of the innovative designer and builder gustave eiffel eiffel and his structural engineer maurice koechlin decided to abandon the pier and instead build an iron truss tower eiffel opted not to use a completely rigid structure which would force stresses to accumulate in the skin and lead eventually to cracking a secondary skeleton was attached to the center pylon then to enable the statue to move slightly in the winds of new york harbor and as the metal expanded on hot summer days he loosely connected the support structure to the skin using flat iron bars which culminated in a mesh of metal straps known as saddles that were riveted to the skin providing firm support in a labor intensive process each saddle had to be crafted individually to prevent galvanic corrosion between the copper skin and the iron support structure eiffel insulated the skin with asbestos impregnated with shellac eiffel s design made the statue one of the earliest examples of curtain wall construction in which the exterior of the structure is not load bearing but is instead supported by an interior framework he included two interior spiral staircases to make it easier for visitors to reach the observation point in the crown access to an observation platform surrounding the torch was also provided but the narrowness of the arm allowed for only a single ladder feet m long as the pylon tower arose eiffel and bartholdi coordinated their work carefully so that completed segments of skin would fit exactly on the support structure the components of the pylon tower were built in the eiffel factory in the nearby parisian suburb of levallois perret the change in structural material from masonry to iron allowed bartholdi to change his plans for the statue s assembly he had originally expected to assemble the skin on site as the masonry pier was built instead he decided to build the statue in france and have it disassembled and transported to the united states for reassembly in place on bedloe s island in a symbolic act the first rivet placed into the skin fixing a copper plate onto the statue s big toe was driven by united states ambassador to france levi p morton the skin was not however crafted in exact sequence from low to high work proceeded on a number of segments simultaneously in a manner often confusing to visitors some work was performed by contractors one of the fingers was made to bartholdi s exacting specifications by a coppersmith in the southern french town of montauban by the statue was complete up to the waist an event barthodi celebrated by inviting reporters to lunch on a platform built within the statue laboulaye died in he was succeeded as chairman of the french committee by ferdinand de lesseps builder of the suez canal the completed statue was formally presented to ambassador morton at a ceremony in paris on july and de lesseps announced that the french government had agreed to pay for its transport to new york the statue remained intact in paris pending sufficient progress on the pedestal by january this had occurred and the statue was disassembled and crated for its ocean voyage the committees in the united states faced great difficulties in obtaining funds for the construction of the pedestal the panic of had led to an economic depression that persisted through much of the decade the liberty statue project was not the only such undertaking that had difficulty raising money construction of the obelisk later known as the washington monument sometimes stalled for years it would ultimately take over three and a half decades to complete there was criticism both of bartholdi s statue and of the fact that the gift required americans to foot the bill for the pedestal in the years following the civil war most americans preferred realistic artworks depicting heroes and events from the nation s history rather than allegorical works like the liberty statue there was also a feeling that americans should design american public works the selection of italian born constantino brumidi to decorate the capitol had provoked intense criticism even though he was a naturalized u s citizen harper s weekly declared its wish that m bartholdi and our french cousins had gone the whole figure while they were about it and given us statue and pedestal at once the new york times stated that no true patriot can countenance any such expenditures for bronze females in the present state of our finances faced with these criticisms the american committees took little action for several years the foundation of bartholdi s statue was to be laid inside fort wood a disused army base on bedloe s island constructed between and since it had rarely been used though during the civil war it had served as a recruiting station the fortifications of the structure were in the shape of an eleven point star the statue s foundation and pedestal were aligned so that it would face southeast greeting ships entering the harbor from the atlantic ocean in the new york committee commissioned richard morris hunt to design the pedestal within months hunt submitted a detailed plan indicating that he expected construction to take about nine months he proposed a pedestal feet m in height faced with money problems the committee reduced that to feet m hunt s pedestal design contains elements of classical architecture including doric portals as well as some elements influenced by aztec architecture the large mass is fragmented with architectural detail in order to focus attention on the statue in form it is a truncated pyramid feet m square at the base and feet m at the top the four sides are identical in appearance above the door on each side there are ten disks upon which bartholdi proposed to place the coats of arms of the states between and there were of them although this was not done above that a balcony was placed on each side framed by pillars bartholdi placed an observation platform near the top of the pedestal above which the statue itself rises according to author louis auchincloss the pedestal craggily evokes the power of an ancient europe over which rises the dominating figure of the statue of liberty the committee hired former army general charles pomeroy stone to oversee the construction work construction on the foot deep m foundation began in and the pedestal s cornerstone was laid in in hunt s original conception the pedestal was to have been made of solid granite financial concerns again forced him to revise his plans the final design called for poured concrete walls up to feet m thick faced with granite blocks this stony creek granite came from the beattie quarry in branford connecticut the concrete mass was the largest poured to that time norwegian immigrant civil engineer joachim goschen gi ver designed the structural framework for the statue of liberty his work involved design computations detailed fabrication and construction drawings and oversight of construction in completing his engineering for the statue s frame gi ver worked from drawings and sketches produced by gustave eiffel fundraising in the us for the pedestal had begun in the committee organized a large number of money raising events as part of one such effort an auction of art and manuscripts poet emma lazarus was asked to donate an original work she initially declined stating she could not write a poem about a statue at the time she was also involved in aiding refugees to new york who had fled antisemitic pogroms in eastern europe these refugees were forced to live in conditions that the wealthy lazarus had never experienced she saw a way to express her empathy for these refugees in terms of the statue the resulting sonnet the new colossus including the lines give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free is uniquely identified with the statue of liberty in american culture and is inscribed on a plaque in its museum even with these efforts fundraising lagged grover cleveland the governor of new york vetoed a bill to provide for the statue project in an attempt the next year to have congress provide sufficient to complete the project also failed the new york committee with only in the bank suspended work on the pedestal with the project in jeopardy groups from other american cities including boston and philadelphia offered to pay the full cost of erecting the statue in return for relocating it joseph pulitzer publisher of the new york world a new york newspaper announced a drive to raise the equivalent of million today pulitzer pledged to print the name of every contributor no matter how small the amount given the drive captured the imagination of new yorkers especially when pulitzer began publishing the notes he received from contributors a young girl alone in the world donated cents the result of self denial one donor gave five cents as a poor office boy s mite toward the pedestal fund a group of children sent a dollar as the money we saved to go to the circus with another dollar was given by a lonely and very aged woman residents of a home for alcoholics in new york s rival city of brooklyn the cities would not merge until donated other drinkers helped out through donation boxes in bars and saloons a kindergarten class in davenport iowa mailed the world a gift of as the donations flooded in the committee resumed work on the pedestal france raised about to build the statue while the united states had to raise up to to build the pedestal on june the french steamer is re fr arrived in new york with the crates holding the disassembled statue on board new yorkers displayed their newfound enthusiasm for the statue two hundred thousand people lined the docks and hundreds of boats put to sea to welcome the ship after five months of daily calls to donate to the statue fund on august the world announced that had been raised from donors and that percent of the total had been received in sums of less than one dollar equivalent to in even with the success of the fund drive the pedestal was not completed until april immediately thereafter reassembly of the statue began eiffel s iron framework was anchored to steel i beams within the concrete pedestal and assembled once this was done the sections of skin were carefully attached due to the width of the pedestal it was not possible to erect scaffolding and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch s balcony to illuminate it a week before the dedication the army corps of engineers vetoed the proposal fearing that ships pilots passing the statue would be blinded instead bartholdi cut portholes in the torch which was covered with gold leaf and placed the lights inside them a power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs after the skin was completed landscape architect frederick law olmsted co designer of manhattan s central park and brooklyn s prospect park supervised a cleanup of bedloe s island in anticipation of the dedication general charles stone claimed on the day of dedication that no man had died during the construction of the statue this was not true however as francis longo a thirty nine year old italian laborer had been killed when an old wall fell on him a ceremony of dedication was held on the afternoon of october president grover cleveland the former new york governor presided over the event on the morning of the dedication a parade was held in new york city estimates of the number of people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million president cleveland headed the procession then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across america general stone was the grand marshal of the parade the route began at madison square once the venue for the arm and proceeded to the battery at the southern tip of manhattan by way of fifth avenue and broadway with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the world building on park row as the parade passed the new york stock exchange traders threw ticker tape from the windows beginning the new york tradition of the ticker tape parade a nautical parade began at p m and president cleveland embarked on a yacht that took him across the harbor to bedloe s island for the dedication de lesseps made the first speech on behalf of the french committee followed by the chairman of the new york committee senator william m evarts a french flag draped across the statue s face was to be lowered to unveil the statue at the close of evarts s speech but bartholdi mistook a pause as the conclusion and let the flag fall prematurely the ensuing cheers put an end to evarts s address president cleveland spoke next stating that the statue s stream of light shall pierce the darkness of ignorance and man s oppression until liberty enlightens the world bartholdi observed near the dais was called upon to speak but he declined orator chauncey m depew concluded the speechmaking with a lengthy address no members of the general public were permitted on the island during the ceremonies which were reserved entirely for dignitaries the only females granted access were bartholdi s wife and de lesseps s granddaughter officials stated that they feared women might be injured in the crush of people the restriction offended area suffragists who chartered a boat and got as close as they could to the island the group s leaders made speeches applauding the embodiment of liberty as a woman and advocating women s right to vote a scheduled fireworks display was postponed until november because of poor weather shortly after the dedication the cleveland gazette an african american newspaper suggested that the statue s torch not be lit until the united states became a free nation in reality liberty enlightening the world indeed the expression makes us sick this government is a howling farce it can not or rather does not protect its citizens within its own borders shove the bartholdi statue torch and all into the ocean until the liberty of this country is such as to make it possible for an inoffensive and industrious colored man to earn a respectable living for himself and family without being ku kluxed perhaps murdered his daughter and wife outraged and his property destroyed the idea of the liberty of this country enlightening the world or even patagonia is ridiculous in the extreme when the torch was illuminated on the evening of the statue s dedication it produced only a faint gleam barely visible from manhattan the world characterized it as more like a glowworm than a beacon bartholdi suggested gilding the statue to increase its ability to reflect light but this proved too expensive the united states lighthouse board took over the statue of liberty in and pledged to install equipment to enhance the torch s effect in spite of its efforts the statue remained virtually invisible at night when bartholdi returned to the united states in he made additional suggestions all of which proved ineffective he did successfully lobby for improved lighting within the statue allowing visitors to better appreciate eiffel s design in president theodore roosevelt once a member of the new york committee ordered the statue s transfer to the war department as it had proved useless as a lighthouse a unit of the army signal corps was stationed on bedloe s island until after which military police remained there while the island was under military jurisdiction wars and other upheavals in europe prompted large scale emigration to the united states in the late th and early th century many entered through new york and saw the statue not as a symbol of enlightenment as bartholdi had intended but as a sign of welcome to their new home the association with immigration only became stronger when an immigrant processing station was opened on nearby ellis island this view was consistent with lazarus s vision in her sonnet she described the statue as mother of exiles but her work had become obscure in the sonnet was engraved on a plaque that was affixed to the base of the statue oral histories of immigrants record their feelings of exhilaration on first viewing the statue of liberty one immigrant who arrived from greece recalled i saw the statue of liberty and i said to myself lady you re such a beautiful sic you opened your arms and you get all the foreigners here give me a chance to prove that i am worth it to do something to be someone in america and always that statue was on my mind the statue rapidly became a landmark originally it was a dull copper color but shortly after a green patina also called verdigris caused by the oxidation of the copper skin began to spread as early as it was mentioned in the press by it had entirely covered the statue believing that the patina was evidence of corrosion congress authorized us equivalent to in for various repairs and to paint the statue both inside and out there was considerable public protest against the proposed exterior painting the army corps of engineers studied the patina for any ill effects to the statue and concluded that it protected the skin softened the outlines of the statue and made it beautiful the statue was painted only on the inside the corps of engineers also installed an elevator to take visitors from the base to the top of the pedestal on july during world war i german saboteurs set off a disastrous explosion on the black tom peninsula in jersey city new jersey in what is now part of liberty state park close to bedloe s island carloads of dynamite and other explosives that were being sent to britain and france for their war efforts were detonated the statue sustained minor damage mostly to the torch bearing right arm and was closed for ten days the cost to repair the statue and buildings on the island was about equivalent to about in the narrow ascent to the torch was closed for public safety reasons and it has remained closed ever since that same year ralph pulitzer who had succeeded his father joseph as publisher of the world began a drive to raise equivalent to in for an exterior lighting system to illuminate the statue at night he claimed over contributors but failed to reach the goal the difference was quietly made up by a gift from a wealthy donor a fact that was not revealed until an underwater power cable brought electricity from the mainland and floodlights were placed along the walls of fort wood gutzon borglum who later sculpted mount rushmore redesigned the torch replacing much of the original copper with stained glass on december president woodrow wilson pressed the telegraph key that turned on the lights successfully illuminating the statue after the united states entered world war i in images of the statue were heavily used in both recruitment posters and the liberty bond drives that urged american citizens to support the war financially this impressed upon the public the war s stated purpose to secure liberty and served as a reminder that embattled france had given the united states the statue in president calvin coolidge used his authority under the antiquities act to declare the statue a national monument a suicide occurred five years later when a man climbed out of one of the windows in the crown and jumped to his death in president franklin roosevelt ordered the statue to be transferred to the national park service nps in the nps gained jurisdiction over the rest of bedloe s island with the army s departure the nps began to transform the island into a park the works progress administration wpa demolished most of the old buildings regraded and reseeded the eastern end of the island and built granite steps for a new public entrance to the statue from its rear the wpa also carried out restoration work within the statue temporarily removing the rays from the statue s halo so their rusted supports could be replaced rusted cast iron steps in the pedestal were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete the upper parts of the stairways within the statue were replaced as well copper sheathing was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been seeping into the pedestal the statue was closed to the public from may until december during world war ii the statue remained open to visitors although it was not illuminated at night due to wartime blackouts it was lit briefly on december and on d day june when its lights flashed dot dot dot dash the morse code for v for victory new powerful lighting was installed in and beginning on v e day the statue was once again illuminated after sunset the lighting was for only a few hours each evening and it was not until that the statue was illuminated every night all night in the interior of the statue within reach of visitors was coated with a special plastic so that graffiti could be washed away in an act of congress officially renamed bedloe s island as liberty island a change advocated by bartholdi generations earlier the act also mentioned the efforts to found an american museum of immigration on the island which backers took as federal approval of the project though the government was slow to grant funds for it nearby ellis island was made part of the statue of liberty national monument by proclamation of president lyndon johnson in in the immigration museum in the statue s base was finally opened in a ceremony led by president richard nixon the museum s backers never provided it with an endowment to secure its future and it closed in after the opening of an immigration museum on ellis island in ivy bottini led a demonstration at the statue where she and others from the national organization for women s new york chapter draped an enormous banner over a railing which read women of the world unite beginning december anti vietnam war veterans occupied the statue flying a us flag upside down from her crown they left december following a federal court order the statue was also several times taken over briefly by demonstrators publicizing causes such as puerto rican independence opposition to abortion and opposition to us intervention in grenada demonstrations with the permission of the park service included a gay pride parade rally and the annual captive baltic nations rally a powerful new lighting system was installed in advance of the american bicentennial in the statue was the focal point for operation sail a regatta of tall ships from all over the world that entered new york harbor on july and sailed around liberty island the day concluded with a spectacular display of fireworks near the statue the statue was examined in great detail by french and american engineers as part of the planning for its centennial in in it was announced that the statue was in need of considerable restoration careful study had revealed that the right arm had been improperly attached to the main structure it was swaying more and more when strong winds blew and there was a significant risk of structural failure in addition the head had been installed feet m off center and one of the rays was wearing a hole in the right arm when the statue moved in the wind the armature structure was badly corroded and about two percent of the exterior plates needed to be replaced although problems with the armature had been recognized as early as when cast iron replacements for some of the bars had been installed much of the corrosion had been hidden by layers of paint applied over the years in may president ronald reagan announced the formation of the statue of liberty ellis island centennial commission led by chrysler corporation chair lee iacocca to raise the funds needed to complete the work through its fundraising arm the statue of liberty ellis island foundation inc the group raised more than million in donations for the renovations of both the statue of liberty and ellis island the statue of liberty was one of the earliest beneficiaries of a cause marketing campaign a promotion advertised that for each purchase made with an american express card the company would contribute one cent to

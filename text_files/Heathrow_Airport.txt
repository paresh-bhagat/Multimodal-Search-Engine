 heathrow airport hi ro hi ro called london airport until and now known as london heathrow iata lhr icao egll is a major international airport in london england it is the largest of the six international airports serving greater london the others being gatwick city luton stansted and southend the airport facility is owned and operated by heathrow airport holdings in it was the seventh busiest airport in the world by international passenger traffic and eighth busiest in europe by total passenger traffic heathrow was founded as a small airfield in but was developed into a much larger airport after world war ii the airport lies miles kilometres west of central london on a site that covers square kilometres square miles it was gradually expanded over seventy five years and now has two parallel east west runways four operational passengers terminals and one cargo terminal the airport is the primary hub for both british airways and virgin atlantic heathrow is mi km west of central london it is located mi km west of hounslow miles south of hayes and miles north east of staines upon thames heathrow falls entirely within the boundaries of the london borough of hillingdon and under the twickenham postcode area with the postcode tw it is surrounded by the villages of sipson harlington harmondsworth and longford to the north and the neighbourhoods of cranford and hatton to the east to the south lie feltham bedfont and stanwell while to the west heathrow is separated from slough horton and windsor in berkshire by the m motorway the airport is located within the hayes and harlington parliamentary constituency as the airport is located west of london and as its runways run east west an airliner s landing approach is usually directly over the conurbation of london when the wind is from the west as it is most of the time the airport forms part of a travel to work area with slough the west part of greater london and the north part of surrey heathrow airport began in as a small airfield great west aerodrome on land southeast of the hamlet of heathrow from which the airport takes its name at that time the land consisted of farms market gardens and orchards there was a heathrow farm approximately where the modern terminal is situated a heathrow hall and a heathrow house this hamlet was largely along a country lane heathrow road which ran roughly along the east and south edges of the present central terminals area development of the whole heathrow area as a much larger airport began in during world war ii it was stated to be for long distance military aircraft bound for the far east by the time the airfield was nearing completion world war ii had ended and the uk government continued to develop the airport as a civil airport the airport was opened on march as london airport and was renamed heathrow airport in the layout for the airport was designed by sir frederick gibberd who designed the original terminals and central area buildings including the original control tower and the multi faith chapel of st george s heathrow airport is used by over airlines flying to destinations in countries the airport is the primary hub of british airways and is a base for virgin atlantic it has four passenger terminals numbered to and a cargo terminal of heathrow s million passengers in were international travellers the remaining were bound for or arriving from places in the uk the busiest single destination in passenger numbers is new york with over million passengers flying between heathrow and jfk airport in in the s heathrow had six runways arranged in three pairs at different angles in the shape of a hexagram with the permanent passenger terminal in the middle and the older terminal along the north edge of the field two of its runways would always be within of the wind direction as the required length for runways has grown heathrow now has only two parallel runways running east west these are extended versions of the two east west runways from the original hexagram from the air almost all of the original runways can still be seen incorporated into the present system of taxiways north of the northern runway and the former taxiway and aprons now the site of extensive car parks is the entrance to the access tunnel and the site of heathrow s unofficial gate guardian for many years the home of a scale model of a british airways concorde g conc the site has been occupied by a model of an emirates airbus a since heathrow airport has anglican catholic free church hindu jewish muslim and sikh chaplains there is a multi faith prayer room and counselling room in each terminal in addition to st george s interdenominational chapel in an underground vault adjacent to the old control tower where christian services take place the chaplains organise and lead prayers at certain times in the prayer room the airport has its resident press corps consisting of six photographers and one tv crew serving all the major newspapers and television stations around the world most of heathrow s internal roads are initial letter coded by area n in the north e g newall road e in the east e g elmdon road s in the south e g stratford road w in the west e g walrus road c in the centre e g camborne road aircraft destined for heathrow are usually routed to one of four holding points air traffic controllers at heathrow approach control based in swanwick hampshire then guide the aircraft to their final approach merging aircraft from the four holds into a single stream of traffic sometimes as close as nautical miles km mi apart considerable use is made of continuous descent approach techniques to minimise the environmental effects of incoming aircraft particularly at night once an aircraft is established on its final approach control is handed over to heathrow tower when runway alternation was introduced aircraft generated significantly more noise on departure than when landing so a preference for westerly operations during daylight was introduced which continues to this day in this mode aircraft take off towards the west and land from the east over london thereby minimising the impact of noise on the most densely populated areas heathrow s two runways generally operate in segregated mode whereby landings are allocated to one runway and takeoffs to the other to further reduce noise nuisance to people beneath the approach and departure routes the use of runways r and l is swapped at each day if the wind is from the west when landings are easterly there is no alternation l remains the landing runway and r the takeoff runway due to the legacy of the now rescinded cranford agreement pending taxiway works to allow the roles to be reversed occasionally landings are allowed on the nominated departure runway to help reduce airborne delays and to position landing aircraft closer to their terminal reducing taxi times night time flights at heathrow are subject to restrictions between and the noisiest aircraft rated qc and qc cannot be scheduled for operation also during the night quota period there are four limits a trial of noise relief zones ran from december to march which concentrated approach flight paths into defined areas compared with the existing paths which were spread out the zones used alternated weekly meaning residents in the no fly areas received respite from aircraft noise for set periods however it was concluded that some residents in other areas experienced a significant disbenefit as a result of the trial and that it should therefore not be taken forward in its current form heathrow received more than noise complaints in just three months over the summer of but around half were made by the same ten people in heathrow introduced fly quiet green a quarterly published league table currently suspended due to the covid pandemic that awards points to the busiest airlines at the airport ostensibly based on their performance relative to each other across a range of environmental benchmarks such as nox emissions heathrow has acknowledged but not attempted to refute ongoing criticism over discrepancies and a lack of transparency around the way in which the figures are manipulated the airport has always refused to publish a breakdown showing how many fly quiet points each performance benchmark has contributed towards the total score it awards to an airline thereby putting obstacles in the way of any independent auditing of the published results among other criticisms of the league table are the unexplained omission of some of the poorer performers among the busiest airlines and the emphasis on relative rather than absolute performance so an airline could well improve its fly quiet score quarter on quarter even if its environmental performance had in fact worsened over the period due to the covid pandemic heathrow has seen a large increase in cargo only flights not only by already established carriers at the airport operating cargo only flights using passenger aircraft but also several cargo only airlines inbound aircraft to london heathrow airport typically follow one of several standard arrival routes stars the stars each terminate at one of four different rnav waypoints and these also define four stacks where aircraft can be held if necessary until they are cleared to begin their approach to land stacks are sections of airspace where inbound aircraft will normally use the pattern closest to their arrival route they can be visualised as invisible helter skelters in the sky each stack descends in ft m intervals from ft m down to ft m aircraft hold between feet and feet at foot intervals if these holds become full aircraft are held at more distant points before being cleared onward to one of the four main holds the following four stacks are currently in place in september the government of the united kingdom established the airports commission an independent commission chaired by sir howard davies to examine various options for increasing capacity at uk airports in july the commission backed a third runway at heathrow which the government approved in october however the england and wales court of appeal rejected this plan for a third runway at heathrow on the basis that the government failed to consider climate change and the environmental impact of aviation on december the uk supreme court lifted the ban on the third runway expansion allowing the construction plan to go ahead until it was required to sell gatwick and stansted airports heathrow airport holdings held a dominant position in the london aviation market and has been heavily regulated by the civil aviation authority caa as to how much it can charge airlines to land the annual increase in landing charge per passenger was capped at inflation minus until april from to charges increased by inflation plus per year taking the fee to per passenger in in march the caa announced that the charge would be allowed to increase by to from april and by inflation plus for each of the following four years in april the caa announced a proposal for heathrow to charge fees calculated by inflation minus continuing until whilst the cost of landing at heathrow is determined by the caa and heathrow airport holdings the allocation of landing slots to airlines is carried out by airport co ordination limited acl until air traffic between heathrow and the united states was strictly governed by the countries bilateral bermuda ii treaty the treaty originally allowed only british airways pan am and twa to fly from heathrow to the us in pan am and twa sold their rights to united airlines and american airlines respectively while virgin atlantic was added to the list of airlines allowed to operate on these routes the bermuda bilateral agreement conflicted with the right of the establishment of the united kingdom concerning its eu membership and as a consequence the uk was ordered to drop the agreement in a new open skies agreement was signed by the united states and the european union on april and came into effect on march shortly afterwards additional us airlines including northwest airlines continental airlines us airways and delta air lines started services to heathrow the airport was criticised in for overcrowding and delays according to heathrow airport holdings heathrow s facilities were originally designed to accommodate a million passengers annually the number of passengers using the airport reached a record million in in the airport was voted the world s least favourite alongside chicago o hare in a tripadvisor survey however the opening of terminal in has relieved some pressure on terminal facilities increasing the airport s terminal capacity to million passengers per year a tie up is also in place with mclaren applied technologies to optimise the general procedure reducing delays and pollution with only two runways operating at over of their capacity heathrow has little room for more flights although the increasing use of larger aircraft such as the airbus a will allow some increase in passenger numbers it is difficult for existing airlines to obtain landing slots to enable them to increase their services from the airport or for new airlines to start operations to increase the number of flights heathrow airport holdings has proposed using the existing two runways in mixed mode whereby aircraft would be allowed to take off and land on the same runway this would increase the airport s capacity from its current movements per year to as many as according to british airways ceo willie walsh heathrow airport holdings has also proposed building a third runway to the north of the airport which would significantly increase traffic capacity policing of the airport is the responsibility of the aviation security a unit of the metropolitan police although the british army including armoured vehicles of the household cavalry has occasionally been deployed at the airport during periods of heightened security citation needed full body scanners are now used at the airport and passengers who object to their use after being selected are required to submit to a hand search in a private room the scanners display passengers bodies as cartoon figures with indicators showing where concealed items may be for many decades heathrow had a reputation for theft from baggage by baggage handlers this led to the airport being nicknamed thiefrow with periodic arrests of baggage handlers following the widespread disruption caused by reports of drone sightings at gatwick airport and a subsequent incident at heathrow a drone detection system was installed airport wide to attempt to combat possible future disruption caused by the illegal use of drones the airport s newest terminal officially known as the queen s terminal was opened on june and has gates designed by spanish architect luis vidal it was built on the site that had been occupied by the original terminal and the queens building the main complex was completed in november and underwent six months of testing before opening to passengers it includes a satellite pier t b a space car park and a cooling station to generate chilled water there are shops and bars and restaurants most flights from terminal are coming from northern europe or west europe it is used by all star alliance members who fly from heathrow consolidating the airlines under star alliance s co location policy move under one roof skyteam new member china airlines and several short haul unaffiliated carriers terminal is also the only terminal at heathrow to accommodate small aircraft jetblue is the only non aligned long haul flight operating from this terminal terminal is one of the two terminals that operate uk and irish domestic flights the airlines moved from their original locations over six months with only of flights operating from there in the first six weeks united airlines transatlantic flights to avoid the opening problems seen at terminal on june united airlines became the first airline to move into terminal from terminals and followed by all nippon airways air canada and air china from terminal air new zealand asiana airlines croatia airlines lot polish airlines south african airways and tap air portugal moved in on october the original terminal opened as the europa building in and was the airport s oldest terminal it had an area of m sq ft and was designed to handle around million passengers annually in its final years it accommodated up to million a total of million passengers passed through the terminal in its lifetime the building was demolished in along with the queens building which had housed airline company offices terminal opened as the oceanic terminal on november to handle flight departures for long haul routes for foreign carriers to the united states asia and other far eastern destinations at this time the airport had a direct helicopter service to central london from the gardens on the roof of the terminal building renamed terminal in it was expanded in with the addition of an arrivals building other facilities added included the uk s first moving walkways in the new million pier was completed to accommodate the airbus a superjumbo emirates and qantas operate regular flights from terminal using the airbus a redevelopment of terminal s forecourt by the addition of a new four lane drop off area and a large pedestrianised plaza complete with a canopy to the front of the terminal building was completed in these improvements were intended to improve passengers experience reduce traffic congestion and improve security as part of this project virgin atlantic was assigned its dedicated check in area known as zone a which features a large sculpture and atrium as of update terminal has an area of m sq ft with gates and in it handled million passengers on flights most flights from terminal are long haul flights from north america asia and other foreign countries other than europe terminal is home to oneworld members with the exception of malaysia airlines qatar airways and royal air maroc all of which use terminal skyteam members aerom xico air france delta air lines klm and middle east airlines and several long haul unaffiliated carriers opened in terminal has gates and is situated to the south of the southern runway next to the cargo terminal and is connected to terminals and by the heathrow cargo tunnel the terminal has an area of m sq ft and is now home to the skyteam alliance except new member china airlines which remained at terminal and aerom xico air france delta air lines klm and middle east airlines which use terminal oneworld carriers malaysia airlines qatar airways royal air maroc and gulf air and to most unaffiliated carriers it has undergone a m upgrade to enable it to accommodate airlines with an upgraded forecourt to reduce traffic congestion and improve security most flights that go to terminal are flights coming from east europe central asia north africa and the middle east as well as a few flights to europe an extended check in area with renovated piers and departure lounges and a new baggage system were installed and four new stands were built to accommodate the airbus a etihad airways korean air malaysia airlines and qatar airways operate regular a flights gulf air and el al operate regular boeing flights terminal lies between the northern and southern runways at the western end of the heathrow site and was opened by queen elizabeth ii on march some years after its inception it opened to the public on march and british airways and its partner company iberia have exclusive use of this terminal which has gates including hardstands the first passenger to enter terminal was a uk ex pat from kenya who passed through security at on the day he was presented with a boarding pass by british airways ceo willie walsh for the first departing flight ba to paris during the two weeks after its opening operations were disrupted by problems with the terminal s it systems coupled with insufficient testing and staff training which caused over flights to be cancelled until march terminal was exclusively used by british airways as its global hub however because of the merger on march iberia s operations at heathrow were moved to the terminal making it the home of international airlines group on july american moved to terminal to allow for easier connections from american s transatlantic flights to british airways flights during the pandemic however all the american flights except jfk have returned to terminal however iberia moved its flights to terminal before the reopening due to the pandemic china southern airlines used terminal due to the pandemic until it was relocated to terminal in november built at billion the terminal consists of a four story main terminal building concourse a and two satellite buildings linked to the main terminal by an underground people mover transit system concourse a has dedicated british airways s narrowbody fleet for flights around the uk and the rest of europe the first satellite concourse b includes dedicated stands for ba and iberia s widebody fleet except for the airbus a and the second satellite concourse c includes dedicated aircraft stands for the a it became fully operational on june terminal was voted skytrax world s best airport terminal in the annual world airport awards the main terminal building concourse a has an area of square metres sq ft while concourse b covers square metres sq ft it has aircraft stands and capacity for a million passengers annually as well as more than shops and restaurants it is also home to british airways flagship lounge the concorde room alongside four further british airways branded lounges one of those lounges is the british airways arrivals lounge which is located land side a further building designated concourse d and of similar size to concourse c may yet be built to the east of the existing site providing up to another stands following british airways merger with iberia this may become a priority since the combined business will require accommodation at heathrow under one roof to maximise the cost savings envisaged under the deal a proposal for concourse d was featured in heathrow s most recent capital investment plan when the transport network around the airport has been extended to cope with the increase in passenger numbers new branches of both the heathrow express and the underground s piccadilly line serve a new shared heathrow terminal station a dedicated motorway spur links the terminal to the m between junctions and the terminal has spaces multi storey car park a more distant long stay car park for business passengers is connected to the terminal by a personal rapid transit system the heathrow pod which became operational in the spring of within the terminal complex an automated people mover apm system known as the transit is used to transport passengers between the satellite buildings as of july heathrow s four passenger terminals are assigned as follows following the opening of terminal in march a complex programme of terminal moves was implemented this saw many airlines move to be grouped in terminals by airline alliance as far as possible following the opening of phase of the new terminal in june all star alliance member airlines with the exception of new member air india which moved in early along with aer lingus and germanwings relocated to terminal in a phased process completed on october additionally by june all airlines left terminal in preparation for its demolition to make room for the construction of phase of terminal some other airlines made further minor moves at a later point e g delta air lines merging all departures in terminal instead of a split between terminals and heathrow airport has four terminals with a total of gates of which can support wide body aircraft and gates that can support an airbus a due to the covid pandemic heathrow s services were sharply reduced it announced that as of april the airport would be transitioning to single runway operations and that it would be temporarily closing terminals and moving all remaining flights into terminals or dual runway operations were restored in august heathrow returned to single runway operations on november on december heathrow announced terminal would be shut until the end of terminal was reopened for use by virgin atlantic and delta on july and terminal was reopened on june terminal opened in and was inaugurated by queen elizabeth ii in april terminal was the heathrow base for british airways ba domestic and european network and a few of its long haul routes before terminal opened the acquisition of british midland international bmi in by ba s owner international airlines group meant british airways took over bmi s short haul and medium haul destinations from the terminal terminal was also the main base for most star alliance members though some were also based at terminal terminal closed at the end of june the site is now being used to extend terminal which opened in june a number of the newer gates used by terminal were built as part of the terminal development and are being retained the last tenants along with british airways were el al icelandair moved to terminal march and latam brasil the third to move in to terminal on may british airways was the last operator in terminal two flights of this carrier one departing to hanover and one arriving from baku marked the terminal closure on june british airways operations have been relocated to terminals and the following airlines operate regularly scheduled passenger flights at london heathrow airport when ranked by passenger traffic heathrow is the sixth busiest internationally behind hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport beijing capital international airport dubai international airport chicago s o hare international airport and tokyo haneda airport for the months ending december london heathrow airport was noted as the best connected airport globally in according to the oag s megahubs index with a connectivity score of dominant carrier british airways was recorded as holding a share of flights at the hub in heathrow was the busiest airport in europe in total passenger traffic with more passengers than paris charles de gaulle airport and more than istanbul atat rk airport heathrow was the fourth busiest european airport by cargo traffic in after frankfurt airport paris charles de gaulle and amsterdam airport schiphol in heathrow s passenger numbers dropped sharply by over a decrease of million travellers compared to due to the impact caused by restrictions and or bans on travel caused by the global covid pandemic heathrow airport processed passengers in but only in and in due to the covid pandemic in dubai international airport was the most popular route with passengers the table below shows the busiest international routes at the airport in the head office of heathrow airport holdings formerly baa limited is located in the compass centre by heathrow s northern runway a building that previously served as a british airways flight crew centre the world business centre heathrow consists of three buildings world business centre houses offices of heathrow airport holdings heathrow airport itself and scandinavian airlines previously international airlines group had its head office in world business centre at one time the british airways head office was located within heathrow airport at speedbird house before the completion of waterside the current ba head office in harmondsworth in june to the north of the airfield lies the northern perimeter road along which most of heathrow s car rental agencies are based and bath road which runs parallel to it but outside the airport campus this is nicknamed the strip by locals because of its continuous line of airport hotels many bus and coach services operate from the large heathrow central bus station which serves terminal and terminal services also operate from the bus stations located at terminal and terminal terminals and are within walking distance of each other transfers from terminals and to terminal and are provided by elizabeth line and heathrow express trains and the london underground piccadilly line direct transfer between terminals and is provided by london buses routes and transit passengers remaining airside are provided with free dedicated transfer buses between terminals the heathrow pod personal rapid transit system shuttles passengers between terminal and the business car park using small driverless transportation pods the pods are battery powered and run on demand on a four kilometre track each able to carry up to four adults two children and their luggage plans exist to extend the pod system to connect terminals and to remote car parks an underground automated people mover system known as the transit operates within terminal linking the main terminal with the satellite terminals b and c the transit operates entirely airside using bombardier innovia apm people mover vehicles the hotel hoppa bus network connects all terminals to major hotels in the area taxis are available at all terminals heathrow is accessible via the nearby m motorway or a road terminals the m motorway terminals and and the a road terminal there are drop off and pick up areas at all terminals and short and long stay multi storey car parks all the heathrow forecourts are drop off only there are further car parks not run by heathrow airport holdings just outside the airport the most recognisable is the national car parks facility although there are many other options these car parks are connected to the terminals by shuttle buses four parallel tunnels under the northern runway connect the m heathrow spur and the a road to terminals the two larger tunnels are each two lanes wide and are used for motorised traffic the two smaller tunnels were originally reserved for pedestrians and bicycles to increase traffic capacity the cycle lanes have been modified to each take a single lane of cars although bicycles still have priority over cars pedestrian access to the smaller tunnels has been discontinued with the free bus services being used instead there are mainly off road bicycle routes to some of the terminals free bicycle parking places are available in car parks and a at terminal and to the north and south of terminal s interchange plaza cycling is not currently allowed through the main tunnel to access terminals and terminal closed in there is a long history of expansion proposals for heathrow since it was first designated as a civil airport following the cancellation of the maplin project in a fourth terminal was proposed but expansion beyond this was ruled out however the airports inquiries of and the airports policy white paper considered further expansion and following a four year long public inquiry in terminal was approved in after many studies and consultations the future of air transport white paper was published which proposed a third runway at heathrow as well as a second runway at stansted airport in january the transport secretary at the time geoff hoon announced that the british government supported the expansion of heathrow by building a third metre ft runway and a sixth terminal building this decision followed the white paper on the future of air transport in the uk and a public consultation in november this was a controversial decision which met with widespread opposition because of the expected greenhouse gas emissions impact on local communities as well as noise and air pollution concerns before the general election the conservative and liberal democrat parties announced that they would prevent the construction of any third runway or further material expansion of the airport s operating capacity the mayor of london then boris johnson took the position that london needs more airport capacity favouring the construction of an entirely new airport in the thames estuary rather than expanding heathrow after the conservative liberal democrat coalition took power it was announced that the third runway expansion was cancelled two years later leading conservatives were reported to have changed their minds on the subject another proposal for expanding heathrow s capacity was the heathrow hub which aims to extend both runways to a total length of about metres and divide them into four so that they each provide two full length runways allowing simultaneous take offs and landings while decreasing noise levels in july the airport submitted three new proposals for expansion to the airports commission which was established to review airport capacity in the southeast of england the airports commission was chaired by sir howard davies he at the time of his appointment was in the employ of gic private limited formerly known as government investment corporation of singapore and a member of its international advisory board gic private limited was then as it remains today one of heathrow s principal owners sir howard davies resigned from these positions upon confirmation of his appointment to lead the airports commission although it has been observed that he failed to identify these interests when invited to complete the airports commission s register of interests each of the three proposals that were to be considered by sir howard davies s commission involved the construction of a third runway either to the north northwest or southwest of the airport the commission released its interim report in december shortlisting three options the north west third runway option at heathrow extending an existing runway at heathrow and a second runway at gatwick airport after this report was published the government confirmed that no options had been ruled out for airport expansion in the south east and that a new runway would not be built at heathrow before the full report was published on july and backed a third north west runway at heathrow reaction to the report was generally adverse particularly from london mayor boris johnson one senior conservative told channel howard davies has dumped an utter steaming pile of poo on the prime minister s desk on october the government confirmed that heathrow would be allowed to build a third runway however a final decision would not be taken until winter of after consultations and government votes the earliest opening year would be on june the uk cabinet approved the third runway with a full vote planned for parliament on june the house of commons voted in favour of the third runway the bill received support from most mps in the conservative and labour parties a judicial review against the decision was launched by four london local authorities affected by the expansion wandsworth richmond hillingdon and hammersmith and fulham in partnership with greenpeace and london mayor sadiq khan khan previously stated he would take legal action if it were passed by parliament in february the court of appeal ruled that the plans for a third runway were illegal since they did not adequately take into account the government s commitments to the paris climate agreement however this ruling was later overturned by the supreme court in december currently all rail connections with heathrow airport run along an east west alignment to and from central london and a number of schemes have been proposed over the years to develop new rail transport links with other parts of london and with stations outside the city this mainline rail service is due to be extended to central london and essex when the elizabeth line currently under construction opens a proposal to create a southern link with london waterloo via the waterloo reading line was abandoned in due to lack of funding and difficulties with a high number of level crossings on the route into london and a plan to link heathrow to the planned high speed hs railway line with a new station heathrow hub was also dropped from the hs plans in march among other schemes that have been considered is a rapid transport link between heathrow and gatwick airports known as heathwick which would allow the airports to operate jointly as an airline hub in the department for transport began to invite proposals for privately funded rail links to heathrow airport projects being considered under this initiative include

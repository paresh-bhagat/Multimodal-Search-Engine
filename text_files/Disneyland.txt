disney disney initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit however he soon felt that the proposed site was too small after hiring the stanford research institute to perform a feasibility study determining an appropriate site for his project disney bought a acre ha site near anaheim in the park was designed by a creative team hand picked by walt from internal and outside talent they founded wed enterprises the precursor to today s walt disney imagineering construction began in and the park was unveiled during

to the ideals the dreams and the hard facts that have created america with the hope that it will be a source of joy and inspiration to all the world walter e disney july the concept for disneyland began when walt disney was visiting griffith park in los angeles with his daughters diane and sharon while watching them ride the merry go round he came up with the idea of a place where adults and their children could go and have fun together though his dream lay dormant for many years the earliest documented draft of disney s plans was sent as a memo to studio production designer dick kelsey on august where it was referred to as a mickey mouse park based on notes disney made during his and ward kimball s trip to the chicago railroad fair the same month with a two day stop in henry ford s museum and greenfield village a place with attractions like a main street and steamboat rides which he had visited eight years earlier when people wrote letters to disney to inquire about visiting the walt disney studios he realized that a functional movie studio had little to offer to visiting fans and began to foster various ideas about building a site near the burbank studios for tourists to visit his ideas evolved to a small play park with a boat ride and other themed areas the initial park concept the mickey mouse park was originally planned for an eight acre ha plot to the south across riverside drive from the studio besides greenfield village and the chicago railroad fair disney was also inspired by tivoli gardens in denmark knott s berry farm colonial williamsburg the century of progress in chicago and the new york s world fair of his designers began working on concepts though the project grew much larger than the land could hold disney hired harrison price from stanford research institute to identify the proper area in which to position the planned theme park based on expected future growth based on price s analysis for which he would be recognized as a disney legend in disney acquired acres ha of orange groves and walnut trees in anaheim southeast of los angeles in neighboring orange county the small burbank site originally considered by disney is now home to walt disney animation studios and abc studios difficulties in obtaining funding prompted disney to investigate new methods of fundraising and he decided to create a show named disneyland it was broadcast on then fledgling abc in return the network agreed to help finance the park for its first five years of operation disneyland was owned by disneyland inc which was jointly owned by walt disney productions walt disney western publishing and abc in addition disney rented out many of the shops on main street u s a to outside companies by walt disney productions bought out all other shares but the partnership had already led to a lasting relationship with abc which would eventually culminate in the walt disney company s acquisition of abc in the mid s construction began on july and cost million to complete equivalent to million in the park was opened one year and one day later u s route later interstate was under construction at the same time just north of the site in preparation for the traffic disneyland was expected to bring two more lanes were added to the freeway before the park was finished disneyland was dedicated at an international press preview event held on sunday july which was open only to invited guests and the media although people attended the event only about half of those were invitees the rest having purchased counterfeit tickets or even sneaked into the park by climbing over the fence the following day it opened to the public featuring twenty attractions the special sunday events including the dedication were televised nationwide and anchored by three of walt disney s friends from hollywood art linkletter bob cummings and ronald reagan abc broadcast the event live during which many guests tripped over the television camera cables page needed in frontierland a camera caught cummings kissing a dancer when disney started to read the plaque for tomorrowland he read partway then stopped when a technician off camera said something to him and after realizing he was on air said i thought i got a signal page needed and began the dedication from the start at one point while in fantasyland linkletter tried to give coverage to cummings who was on the pirate ship he was not ready and tried to give the coverage back to linkletter who had lost his microphone cummings then did a play by play of him trying to find it in front of mr toad s wild ride page needed traffic was delayed on the two lane harbor boulevard page needed famous figures who were scheduled to show up every two hours showed up all at once the temperature was an unusually high f c and because of a local plumbers strike disney was given a choice of having working drinking fountains or running toilets he chose the latter leaving many drinking fountains dry this generated negative publicity since pepsi sponsored the park s opening disappointed guests believed the inoperable fountains were a cynical way to sell soda while other vendors ran out of food the asphalt that had been poured that morning was soft enough to let women s high heeled shoes sink into it some parents threw their children over the crowd s shoulders to get them onto rides such as the king arthur carrousel in later years disney and his executives referred to july as black sunday after the extremely negative press from the preview opening walt disney invited attendees back for a private second day to experience disneyland properly at the time and during the lifetimes of walt and roy disney july was considered merely a preview with july the official opening day since then aided by memories of the television broadcast the company has adopted july as the official date the one commemorated every year as disneyland s birthday in september soviet first secretary nikita khrushchev spent thirteen days in the united states with two requests to visit disneyland and to meet john wayne hollywood s top box office draw due to the cold war tension and security concerns he was famously denied an excursion to disneyland the shah of iran and empress farah were invited to disneyland by walt disney in the early s there was moderate controversy over the lack of african american employees as late as civil rights activists were pressuring disneyland to hire black people with executives responding that they would consider the requests citation needed the park did however hire people of asian descent such as ty wong and bob kuwahara as part of the casa de fritos operation at disneyland doritos spanish for little golden things were created at the park to recycle old tortillas that would have been discarded the frito lay company saw the popularity of the item and began selling them regionally in and then nationwide in on august an estimated anti war yippies entered disneyland in a planned protest against the vietnam war the protestors held grievances with specific aspects of the theme park itself such as the aunt jemima themed pancake restaurant in frontierland and the park s association with bank of america a subject of controversy at the time for its lending to military contractors such as boeing the yippies were met by an estimated riot police who established lookouts within the park and another on standby just outside of the entrance gates around p m many of the yippies occupied tom sawyer island purportedly smoking cannabis and causing cast members to halt park guests from boarding rafts to the island an hour later the group of yippies converged at main street u s a and became confrontational with other park guests and riot police after tearing down patriotic bunting while unfurling viet cong and youth international party flags standby riot police entered and the park was evacuated around p m when some of the insurgents approached the park s bank of america branch sparking concern that the building could be burned in a similar fashion to the arson of a bank of america in isla vista in february police arrested park guests and it was only the second unexpected early closure in park history the first being in response to the assassination of john f kennedy in the incident was cited as a clash of the park management s perceived appeal to tradition following the death of walt disney and the growing counterculture movement among young people in the united states despite the opening of the more expansive walt disney world resort in disneyland continued to set attendance records and maintained its status as a major tourist attraction in the bear country land was opened and the main street electrical parade was introduced disneyland underwent several changes in preparation for the united states bicentennial in walt disney s carousel of progress was replaced with america sings an audio animatronic

existing parking lot south of disneyland was repurposed by these projects the six level space mickey and friends parking structure was constructed in the northwest corner upon completion in it was the largest parking structure in the united states the park s management team during the mid s was a source of controversy among fans and employees in an effort to boost profits various changes were begun by then executives cynthia harriss and paul pressler while their initiatives provided a short term increase in shareholder returns they drew widespread criticism for their lack of foresight the retail backgrounds of harriss and pressler led to a gradual shift in disneyland s focus from attractions to merchandising outside consultants mckinsey company were brought in to help streamline operations resulting in many changes and cutbacks after nearly a decade of deferred maintenance the original park was showing signs of neglect fans of the park decried the perceived decline in customer value and park quality and rallied for the dismissal of the management team matt ouimet the former president of the disney cruise line was promoted to assume leadership of the disneyland resort in late shortly

turnstiles and other locations the disneyland band which has been part of the park since its opening plays the role of the town band on main street u s a it also breaks out into smaller groups like the main street strawhatters the hook and ladder co and the pearly band in fantasyland however on march the disneyland resort notified the band members of an end of run the reason for doing so is that they would start a new higher energy band the veteran band members were invited to audition for the new disneyland band and were told that even if they did not make the new band or audition they would still play in small groups around the park this sparked some controversy with supporters of the traditional band disneyland has featured a number of different parades traveling down the park s central main street fantasyland corridor there have been daytime and nighttime parades that celebrated disney films or seasonal holidays with characters music and large floats one of the most popular parades was the main street electrical parade which recently ended a limited time return engagement after an extended run at the magic kingdom at walt disney world in lake buena vista florida from may through november as part of disneyland s th anniversary walt disney s parade of dreams was presented celebrating several disney films including the lion king the little mermaid alice in wonderland and

and expanded to main street and sleeping beauty castle in with the premiere of disneyland forever since disneyland has moved to a rotating repertoire of firework spectaculars scheduling of fireworks shows depends on the time of year during the slower off season periods the fireworks are only offered on weekends during the busier times disney offers additional nights the park offers fireworks nightly during its busy periods which include easter spring break summer and christmas time disneyland spends about per night on the fireworks show the show is normally offered at or pm if the park is scheduled to close at pm or later but shows have started as early as pm a major consideration is the weather and wind especially at higher altitude which can force the delay or cancellation of the show in response to this alternate versions of the fireworks spectaculars have been created in recent years solely using the projections and lighting effects with a few minor exceptions such as july and new year s eve shows must finish by pm due to the conditions of the permit issued by the city of anaheim in recent years disneyland uses smaller and mid sized fireworks shells and more low level pyrotechnics on the castle to allow guests to enjoy the fireworks spectaculars even if there is a weather issue such as high wind this precedent is known as b show the first fireworks show to have this format was believe in holiday magic from the holiday season from disneyland s opening day until the price of the attractions was in addition to the price of park admission guests paid a small admission fee to get into the park but admission to most of the rides and attractions required guests to purchase tickets either individually or in a book that consisted of several coupons initially labeled a through c a coupons allowed admission to the smaller rides and attractions such as the main street vehicles whereas c coupons were used for the most common attractions like peter pan s flight or the mad tea party as more thrilling rides were introduced such as the disneyland monorail or the matterhorn bobsleds d and then eventually e coupons were introduced coupons could be combined to equal the equivalent of another ticket e g two a tickets equal one b ticket the term e ticket attraction is still used to refer to these most in demand attractions even though the coupons themselves are long consigned to history disneyland later featured a keys to the kingdom booklet of tickets which consisted of unvalued coupons sold for a single flat rate these coupons could be used for any attraction regardless of its regular value in disney dropped the idea for individual ride tickets replacing them with passports charging a single admission price with unlimited access to all attractions except shooting galleries while this idea was not original to disney it had business advantages in addition to guaranteeing that everyone paid the same entry amount regardless of their length of stay or number of rides ridden the park no longer had to print ride tickets provide staff for ticket booths nor provide staff to collect tickets or monitor attractions for people sneaking on without tickets later disney introduced other entry options such as multi day passes annual passes which allow unlimited entry to the park for an annual fee and southern california residents discounts in february disneyland adopted a demand based pricing system for single day admission charging different prices for value regular and peak days based on projected attendance approximately of days will be designated as value mainly weekdays when school is in session will be designated as regular and will be designated as peak mostly during holidays and weekends in july in february disneyland

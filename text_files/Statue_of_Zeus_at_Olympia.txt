coordinates n e n e the statue of zeus at olympia was a giant seated figure about m ft tall made by the greek sculptor phidias around bc at the sanctuary of olympia greece and erected in the temple of zeus there zeus is the sky and thunder god in ancient greek religion who rules as king of the gods of mount olympus the statue was a chryselephantine sculpture of ivory plates and gold panels on a wooden framework zeus sat on a painted cedarwood throne ornamented with ebony ivory gold and precious stones it was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world the statue was lost and destroyed before the end of the th century ad with conflicting accounts of the date and circumstances details of its form are known only from ancient greek descriptions and representations on coins the statue of zeus was commissioned by the eleans custodians of the olympic games in the latter half of the fifth century bc for their newly constructed temple of zeus seeking to outdo their athenian rivals the eleans employed sculptor phidias who had previously made the massive statue of athena parthenos in the parthenon the statue occupied half the width of the aisle of the temple built to house it the geographer strabo noted early in the st century bc that the statue gave the impression that if zeus arose and stood erect he would unroof the temple the zeus was a chryselephantine sculpture made with ivory and gold panels on a wooden substructure no copy in marble or bronze has survived though there are recognizable but only approximate versions on coins of nearby elis and on roman coins and engraved gems the nd century ad geographer and traveler pausanias left a detailed description the statue was crowned with a sculpted wreath of olive sprays and wore a gilded robe made from glass and carved with animals and lilies its right hand held a small chryselephantine statue of crowned nike goddess of victory its left a scepter inlaid with many metals supporting an eagle the throne featured painted figures and wrought images and was decorated with gold precious stones ebony and ivory zeus golden sandals rested upon a footstool decorated with an amazonomachy in relief the passage underneath the throne was restricted by painted screens pausanias also recounts that the statue was kept constantly coated with olive oil to counter the harmful effect on the ivory caused by the marshiness of the altis grove the floor in front of the image was paved with black tiles and surrounded by a raised rim of marble to contain the oil this reservoir acted as a reflecting pool which doubled the apparent height of the statue according to the roman historian livy the roman general aemilius paullus the victor over macedon saw the statue and was moved to his soul as if he had seen the god in person while the st century ad greek orator dio chrysostom declared that a single glimpse of the statue would make a man forget all his earthly troubles according to a legend when phidias was asked what inspired him whether he climbed mount olympus to see zeus or whether zeus came down from olympus so that phidias could see him the artist answered that he portrayed zeus according to book one verses of homer s iliad he spoke the son of cronos and nodded his head with the dark brows and the immortally anointed hair of the great god swept from his divine head and all olympos was shaken the sculptor also was reputed to have immortalised pantarkes the winner of the boys wrestling event at the eighty sixth olympiad who was said to have been his beloved eromenos by carving pantarkes kalos pantarkes is beautiful into zeus s little finger and by placing a relief of the boy crowning himself at the feet of the statue according to pausanias when the image was quite finished pheidias prayed the god to show by a sign whether the work was to his liking immediately runs the legend a thunderbolt fell on that part of the floor where down to the present day the bronze jar stood to cover the place according to roman historian suetonius the roman emperor caligula gave orders that such statues of the gods as were especially famous for their sanctity or their artistic merit including that of jupiter at olympia should be brought from greece in order to remove their heads and put his own in their place the emperor was assassinated before this could happen in ad his death was supposedly foretold by the statue which suddenly uttered such a peal of laughter that the scaffolding collapsed and the workmen took to their heels in ad the christian roman emperor theodosius i banned participation in pagan cults and closed the temples the sanctuary at olympia fell into disuse the circumstances of the statue s eventual destruction are unknown the th century byzantine historian georgios kedrenos records a tradition that it was carried off to constantinople where it was destroyed in the great fire of the palace of lausus in ad alternatively the statue perished along with the temple which was severely damaged by fire in ad but earlier loss or damage is implied by lucian of samosata in the later nd century who referenced it in timon they have laid hands on your person at olympia my lord high thunderer and you had not the energy to wake the dogs or call in the neighbours surely they might have come to the rescue and caught the fellows before they had finished packing up the loot the approximate date of the statue the third quarter of the th century bc was confirmed in the rediscovery of phidias workshop approximately where pausanias said the statue of zeus was constructed archaeological finds included tools for working gold and ivory ivory chippings precious stones and terracotta moulds most of the latter were used to create glass plaques and to form the statue s robe from sheets of glass naturalistically draped and folded then gilded a cup inscribed or i belong to phidias was found at the site however the inscription is widely considered to be a forgery

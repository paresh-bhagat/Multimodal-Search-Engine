 the dome of the rock arabic romanized qubbat a akhra is an islamic shrine located on the temple mount in the old city of jerusalem a site also known to muslims as the al haram al sharif or the al aqsa compound its initial construction was undertaken by the umayyad caliphate on the orders of abd al malik during the second fitna in ce and it has since been situated on top of the site of the second jewish temple built in c bce to replace the destroyed solomon s temple which was destroyed by the romans in ce the original dome collapsed in and was rebuilt in the dome of the rock is the world s oldest surviving work of islamic architecture its architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby byzantine churches and palaces although its outside appearance was significantly changed during the ottoman period and again in the modern period notably with the addition of the gold plated roof in and again in the octagonal plan of the structure may have been influenced by the byzantine era church of the seat of mary also known as kathisma in greek and al qadismu in arabic which was built between and on the road between jerusalem and bethlehem the foundation stone or noble rock that the temple was built over bears great significance in the abrahamic religions as the place where god created the world as well as the first human adam it is also believed to be the site where abraham attempted to sacrifice his son and as the place where god s divine presence is manifested more than in any other place towards which jews turn during prayer the site s great significance for muslims derives from traditions connecting it to the creation of the world and the belief that the night journey of muhammad began from the rock at the centre of the structure designated by unesco as a world heritage site it has been called jerusalem s most recognizable landmark along with two nearby old city structures the western wall and the resurrection rotunda in the church of the holy sepulchre it is the earliest archaeologically attested religious structure to be built by a muslim ruler and the building s inscriptions contain the earliest epigraphic proclamations of islam and of the islamic prophet muhammad the inscriptions proved to be a milestone as afterward they became a common feature in islamic structures and almost always mention muhammad the dome of the rock remains a unique monument of islamic culture in almost all respects including as a work of art and as a cultural and pious document according to historian oleg grabar the structure is basically octagonal it is capped at its centre by a dome approximately m ft in diameter mounted on an elevated circular drum standing on supports tiers and columns surrounding this circle is an octagonal arcade of piers and columns the octagonal arcade and the inner circular drum create an inner ambulatorium that encircles the holy rock the outer walls are also octagonal they each measure approximately m ft wide and m ft high the outer and inner octagon create a second outer ambulatorium surrounding the inner one both the circular drum and the exterior walls contain many windows the interior of the dome is lavishly decorated with mosaic faience and marble much of which was added several centuries after its completion it also contains qur anic inscriptions they vary from today s standard text mainly changes from the first to the third person and are mixed with pious inscriptions not in the quran the dedicatory inscription in kufic script placed around the dome contains the date believed to be the year the dome was first completed ah ce while the name of the corresponding caliph and builder of the dome al malik was deleted and replaced by the name of abbasid caliph al ma mun r during whose reign renovations took place the decoration of the outer walls went through two major phases the initial umayyad scheme comprised marble and mosaics much like the interior walls sixteenth century ottoman sultan suleyman the magnificent replaced it with turkish faience tiles the ottoman tile decoration was replaced in the s with faithful copies produced in italy surah ya sin the heart of the quran is inscribed across the top of the tile work and was commissioned in the th century by suleiman the magnificent al isra the surah which tells the story of the isra or night journey is inscribed above this the dome of the rock is situated in the center of the temple mount the site of solomon s temple and the second jewish temple which had been greatly expanded under herod the great in the st century bce herod s temple was destroyed in ce by the romans and after the bar kokhba revolt in ce a roman temple to jupiter capitolinus was built at the site by emperor hadrian jerusalem was ruled by the byzantine empire throughout the th to th centuries during this time christian pilgrimage to jerusalem began to develop the church of the holy sepulchre was built under constantine in the s but the temple mount was left undeveloped after a failed project of restoration of the jewish temple under julian the apostate in ce byzantine jerusalem was conquered by the arab armies of umar ibn al khattab second caliph of the rashidun caliphate umar was advised by ka b al ahbar a jewish rabbi who converted to islam that the site is identical with the site of the former jewish temples in jerusalem among the first muslims jerusalem was referred to as madinat bayt al maqdis city of the temple the initial octagonal structure of the dome of the rock and its round wooden dome had basically the same shape as it does today it was built by the order of the umayyad caliph abd al malik r according to sibt ibn al jawzi construction started in while al suyuti holds that its commencement year was a dedicatory inscription in kufic script is preserved inside the dome the date is recorded as ah ce the year most historians believe the construction of the original dome was completed an alternative interpretation of the inscription claims that it indicates the year when construction started in this inscription the name of al malik was deleted and replaced by the name of the abbasid caliph al ma mun r this alteration of the original inscription was first noted by melchior de vog in some scholars have suggested that the dome was added to an existing building built either by muawiyah i r or indeed a byzantine building dating to before the muslim conquest built under heraclius r the dome of the rock s architecture and mosaics were patterned after nearby byzantine churches and palaces the supervisor and engineer in charge of the project were raja ibn haywa yazid ibn salam and the latter s son baha raja was a muslim theologian and native of beisan and yazid and baha were mawali non arab muslim converts clients of abd al malik from jerusalem abd al malik was represented in the supervision of the construction by his son sa id al khayr the caliph employed expert works from across his domain at the time restricted to syria and egypt who were presumably christians construction cost was reportedly seven times the yearly tax income of egypt the historian k a c creswell noted that those who built the shrine used the measurements of the church of the holy sepulchre the diameter of the dome of the shrine is m ft and its height m ft while the diameter of the dome of the church of the holy sepulchre is m ft and its height m ft narratives by the medieval sources about abd al malik s motivations in building the dome of the rock vary at the time of its construction the caliph was engaged in war with christian byzantium and its syrian christian allies on the one hand and with the rival caliph abd allah ibn al zubayr who controlled mecca the annual destination of muslim pilgrimage on the other hand thus one series of explanations was that abd al malik intended for the dome of the rock to be a religious monument of victory over the christians that would distinguish islam s uniqueness within the common abrahamic religious setting of jerusalem home of the two older abrahamic faiths judaism and christianity the historian shelomo dov goitein has argued that the dome of the rock was intended to compete with the many fine buildings of worship of other religions the very form of a rotunda given to the qubbat as sakhra although it was foreign to islam was destined to rival the many christian domes the other main explanation holds that abd al malik in the heat of the war with ibn al zubayr sought to build the structure to divert the focus of the muslims in his realm from the ka aba in mecca where ibn al zubayr would publicly condemn the umayyads during the annual pilgrimage to the sanctuary though most modern historians dismiss the latter account as a product of anti umayyad propaganda in the traditional muslim sources and doubt that abd al malik would attempt to alter the sacred muslim requirement of fulfilling the pilgrimage to the ka aba other historians concede that this cannot be conclusively dismissed the building was severely damaged by earthquakes in and again in the dome collapsed in an earthquake in and was rebuilt in the mosaics on the drum were repaired in the earthquake of resulted in the introduction of wooden beams to enforce the dome for centuries christian pilgrims were able to come and experience the temple mount but escalating violence against pilgrims to jerusalem al hakim bi amr allah who ordered the destruction of the holy sepulchre was an example resulted in the crusades the crusaders captured jerusalem in and the dome of the rock was given to the augustinians who turned it into a church while the nearby jami a al aqsa first became a royal palace for a while and then for much of the th century the headquarters of the knights templar the templars active from c identified the dome of the rock as the site of the temple of solomon the templum domini as they called the dome of the rock featured on the official seals of the order s grand masters such as everard des barres and renaud de vichiers and soon became the architectural model for round templar churches across europe jerusalem was recaptured by saladin on october and the dome of the rock was reconsecrated as a muslim shrine the cross on top of the dome was replaced by a crescent and a wooden screen was placed around the rock below saladin s nephew al malik al mu azzam isa carried out other restorations within the building and added the porch to the jami a al aqsa the dome of the rock was the focus of extensive royal patronage by the sultans during the mamluk period which lasted from until during the reign of suleiman the magnificent the exterior of the dome of the rock was covered with tiles this work took seven

of jordan with funds supplied by arab governments and turkey the work included replacement of large numbers of tiles dating back to the reign of suleiman the magnificent which had become dislodged by heavy rain in as part of this restoration the dome was covered with a durable aluminium bronze alloy made in italy that replaced the lead exterior before the dome was covered in blackened lead in the course of substantial restoration carried out from to the lead was replaced by aluminum bronze plates covered with gold leaf a few hours after the israeli flag was hoisted over the dome of the rock in during the six day war israelis lowered it on the orders of moshe dayan and invested the muslim waqf religious trust with the authority to manage the temple mount in order to keep the peace in the golden dome covering was refurbished following a donation of us million by king hussein of jordan who sold one of his houses in london to fund the kilograms of gold required the dome of the rock has been depicted on the obverse and reverse of several middle east currencies reverse of a iranian rial banknote reverse of a jordanian dinar banknote since the dinar note bears the dome s depiction obverse of a saudi riyal banknote obverse of a palestinian pound banknote the dome is maintained by the ministry of awqaf in amman jordan until the mid th century non muslims were not permitted in the area since non muslims have been permitted limited access however non muslims are not permitted to pray on the temple mount bring prayer books or wear religious apparel the israeli police help enforce this israel restricted access for a short time during of palestinian residents of the west bank to the temple mount west bank palestinian men had to be over to be eligible for a permit palestinian residents of jerusalem who hold israeli residency cards and palestinians with israeli citizenship are permitted unrestricted access some orthodox rabbis encourage jews to visit the site while most forbid entry to the compound lest there be a violation of jewish law even rabbis who encourage entrance to the temple mount prohibit entrance to the actual dome of the rock the location of the dome of the rock is believed by many muslims to be the site mentioned in sura of the qur an which tells the story of the isra and mi raj the miraculous night journey of prophet muhammad from the great mosque of mecca to the masjid al aqsa the farthest place of prayer where he prayed and then to visit heaven where he leads prayers and rises to heaven to receive instructions from allah although the city of jerusalem is not mentioned by any of its names in the qur an it is mentioned in hadiths as the place of muhammad s night journey judging though by the early muslim sources this doesn t seem to have been yet a fully formulated part of the beliefs shared by muslims during the construction of the dome in the th century and the inscriptions inside the dome attributing the building to caliph abd al malik in the year do not refer at all to the night journey but contain only the quranic view on the nature of the prophet isa jesus instead the inscription is in a mosaic frieze that includes an explicit rejection of the divinity of christ so peace is upon me the day i was born and the day i die and the day i shall be raised alive such is jesus son of mary it is a statement of truth about which they doubt it is not befitting to the majesty of allah that he should take himself a child glory be to him when he determines a matter he only says to it be and it is according to goitein the inscriptions decorating the interior clearly display a spirit of polemic against christianity whilst stressing at the same time the qur anic doctrine that jesus was a true prophet the formula la sharika lahu god has no companion is repeated five times the verses from sura maryam which strongly reaffirm jesus prophethood to god are quoted together with the prayer allahumma salli ala rasulika wa abdika isa bin maryam o lord send your blessings to your prophet and servant jesus son of mary he believes that this shows that rivalry with christendom together with the spirit of muslim mission to the christians was at work at the time of construction at the beginning of the th century ibn ishaq codified the earliest arabic source pertaining to the jerusalem rock as part of his sirat al nabi a biography of the islamic prophet muhammad introducing the notion that right after the prophet s night journey from mecca to jerusalem isra he set off immediately and specifically from the rock in his ascension mi raj to heaven where god instructed him in the doctrines of the new religion today many muslims believe the dome serves for the commemoration of the prophet s ascension in accordance to the views shared by some islamic scholars that the rock is indeed the spot from which muhammad ascended to heaven accompanied by the angel gabriel further muhammad was taken here by gabriel to pray with abraham moses and jesus other islamic scholars believe that the prophet ascended to heaven from the masjid al aqsa of which the dome of the rock is a part in traditional jewish sources it is believed to be the place from which the creation of the world began moreover many jews believe the site to be where abraham prepared to sacrifice his son isaac the foundation stone and its surroundings which lie at the center of the dome are considered the holiest site in judaism citation needed jews traditionally regard the location of the stone as the holiest spot on earth the site of the holy of holies of the first and the second temple citation needed though muslims now pray towards the kaaba at mecca they once faced the temple mount as the jews do islamic tradition holds that muhammad led prayers towards jerusalem until the th or th month after his migration from mecca to medina when allah directed him to instead turn towards the kaaba in mecca the temple institute wishes to relocate the dome to another site and replace it with a third temple many israelis are ambivalent about the movement s wishes weasel words some religious jews following rabbinic teaching believe that the temple should only be rebuilt in the messianic era and that it would be presumptuous of people to force god s hand however some evangelical christians consider rebuilding of the temple to be a prerequisite to armageddon and the second coming jeremy gimpel a us born candidate for the jewish home political party in the israeli elections caused a controversy when he was recorded telling a fellowship church evangelical group in florida in to imagine the incredible experience that would follow were the dome to be destroyed and the construction of the third temple begun all evangelicals would immediately rush to go to israel he opined the dome of the rock has inspired the architecture of a number of buildings these include the octagonal church of st giacomo in italy the mausoleum of sultan suleiman the magnificent in istanbul the octagonal moorish revival style rumbach street synagogue in budapest and the new synagogue in berlin germany it was long believed by christians that the dome of the rock echoed the architecture of the temple in jerusalem as can be seen in raphael s the marriage of the virgin and in perugino s marriage of the virgin the interior of the dome the dome

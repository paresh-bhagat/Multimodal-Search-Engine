 the suez canal egyptian arabic qan t el sewes is an artificial sea level waterway in egypt connecting the mediterranean sea to the red sea through the isthmus of suez and dividing africa and asia the km mi long canal is a popular trade route between europe and asia in ferdinand de lesseps formed the suez canal company for the express purpose of building the canal construction of the canal lasted from to the canal officially opened on november it offers vessels a direct route between the north atlantic and northern indian oceans via the mediterranean sea and the red sea avoiding the south atlantic and southern indian oceans and reducing the journey distance from the arabian sea to london by approximately kilometres mi or days at knots km h mph to days at knots km h mph the canal extends from the northern terminus of port said to the southern terminus of port tewfik at the city of suez in more than vessels traversed the canal an average of per day the original canal featured a single lane waterway with passing locations in the ballah bypass and the great bitter lake it contained according to alois negrelli s plans no lock systems with seawater flowing freely through it in general the water in the canal north of the bitter lakes flows north in winter and south in summer south of the lakes the current changes with the tide at suez the canal was the property of the egyptian government but european shareholders mostly british and french owned the concessionary company which operated it until july when president gamal abdel nasser nationalised it an event which led to the suez crisis of october november the canal is operated and maintained by the state owned suez canal authority sca of egypt under the convention of constantinople it may be used in time of war as in time of peace by every vessel of commerce or of war without distinction of flag nevertheless the canal has played an important military strategic role as a naval short cut and choke point navies with coastlines and bases on both the mediterranean sea and the red sea egypt and israel have a particular interest in the suez canal after egypt closed the suez canal at the beginning of the six day war on june the canal remained closed for precisely eight years reopening on june the egyptian government launched construction in to expand and widen the ballah bypass for km mi to speed up the canal s transit time the expansion intended to nearly double the capacity of the suez canal from to ships per day at a cost of le billion us billion this project was funded with interest bearing investment certificates issued exclusively to egyptian entities and individuals the suez canal authority officially opened the new side channel in this side channel at the northern side of the east extension of the suez canal serves the east terminal for berthing and unberthing vessels from the terminal as the east container terminal is located on the canal itself before the construction of the new side channel it was not possible to berth or unberth vessels at the terminal while a convoy was running ancient west east canals were built to facilitate travel from the nile to the red sea one smaller canal is believed to have been constructed under the auspices of senusret ii or ramesses ii another canal probably incorporating a portion of the first was constructed under the reign of necho ii but the only fully functional canal was engineered and completed by darius i james henry breasted attributes the earliest known attempt to construct a canal to the first cataract near aswan to the sixth dynasty of egypt and its completion to senusret iii of the twelfth dynasty of egypt the legendary sesostris likely either pharaoh senusret ii or senusret iii of the twelfth dynasty of egypt may have constructed the ancient canal the canal of the pharaohs joining the nile with the red sea bc when an irrigation channel was constructed around bc that was navigable during the flood season leading into a dry river valley east of the nile river delta named wadi tumilat it is said that in ancient times the red sea reached northward to the bitter lakes and lake timsah in his meteorology aristotle bc wrote one of their kings tried to make a canal to it for it would have been of no little advantage to them for the whole region to have become navigable sesostris is said to have been the first of the ancient kings to try but he found that the sea was higher than the land so he first and darius afterwards stopped making the canal lest the sea should mix with the river water and spoil it strabo wrote that sesostris started to build a canal and pliny the elder ad wrote next comes the tyro tribe and the harbour of the daneoi from which sesostris king of egypt intended to carry a ship canal to where the nile flows into what is known as the delta this is a distance of over miles km later the persian king darius had the same idea and yet again ptolemy ii who made a trench feet m wide feet m deep and about miles km long as far as the bitter lakes in the th century the northward extension of the later darius i canal was discovered extending from lake timsah to the ballah lakes this was dated to the middle kingdom of egypt by extrapolating the dates of ancient sites along its course the reliefs of the punt expedition under hatshepsut bc depict seagoing vessels carrying the expeditionary force returning from punt this suggests that a navigable link existed between the red sea and the nile recent excavations in wadi gawasis may indicate that egypt s maritime trade started from the red sea and did not require a canal citation needed evidence seems to indicate its existence by the th century bc during the time of ramesses ii remnants of an ancient west east canal through the ancient egyptian cities of bubastis pi ramesses and pithom were discovered by napoleon bonaparte and his engineers and cartographers in according to the histories of the greek historian herodotus about bc necho ii undertook to dig a west east canal through the wadi tumilat between bubastis and heroopolis and perhaps continued it to the heroopolite gulf and the red sea regardless necho is reported as having never completed his project herodotus was told that men perished in this undertaking but this figure is doubtless exaggerated according to pliny the elder necho s extension to the canal was about kilometres statute miles equal to the total distance between bubastis and the great bitter lake allowing for winding through valleys the length that herodotus tells of over stadia i e over kilometres or miles must be understood to include the entire distance between the nile and the red sea at that time with necho s death work was discontinued herodotus tells that the reason the project was abandoned was because of a warning received from an oracle that others would benefit from its successful completion necho s war with nebuchadnezzar ii most probably prevented the canal s continuation necho s project was completed by darius i of persia who ruled over ancient egypt after it had been conquered by his predecessor cambyses ii it may be that by darius s time a natural waterway passage which had existed between the heroopolite gulf and the red sea in the vicinity of the egyptian town of shaluf alt chalouf or shaloof located just south of the great bitter lake had become so blocked with silt that darius needed to clear it out so as to allow navigation once again according to herodotus darius s canal was wide enough that two triremes could pass each other with oars extended and required four days to traverse darius commemorated his achievement with a number of granite stelae that he set up on the nile bank including one near kabret and a further one a few kilometres north of suez darius the great s suez inscriptions read king darius says i am a persian setting out from persia i conquered egypt i ordered to dig this canal from the river that is called nile and flows in egypt to the sea that begins in persia therefore when this canal had been dug as i had ordered ships went from egypt through this canal to persia as i had intendedthe canal left the nile at bubastis an inscription on a pillar at pithom records that in or bce it was again reopened by ptolemy ii philadelphus in arsinoe ptolemy constructed a navigable lock with sluices at the heroopolite gulf of the red sea which allowed the passage of vessels but prevented salt water from the red sea from mingling with the fresh water in the canal in the second half of the th century french cartographers discovered the remnants of an ancient north south canal past the east side of lake timsah and ending near the north end of the great bitter lake this proved to be the canal made by darius i as his stele commemorating its construction was found at the site this ancient second canal may have followed a course along the shoreline of the red sea when it once extended north to lake timsah the red sea is believed by some historians to have gradually receded over the centuries its coastline slowly moving southward away from lake timsah and the great bitter lake coupled with persistent accumulations of nile silt maintenance and repair of ptolemy s canal became increasingly cumbersome over each passing century two hundred years after the construction of ptolemy s canal cleopatra seems to have had no west east waterway passage because the pelusiac branch of the nile which fed ptolemy s west east canal had by that time dwindled being choked with silt in support of this contention one can note that in bce during a reversal of fortune in mark antony s and cleopatra s war against octavian she attempted to escape egypt with her fleet by raising the ships out of the mediterranean and dragging them across the isthmus of suez to the red sea then according to plutarch the arabs of petra attacked and burned the first wave of these ships and cleopatra abandoned the effort modern historians however maintain that her ships were burned by the enemy forces of malichus i by the th century a navigable canal existed between old cairo and the red sea but accounts vary as to who ordered its construction either trajan or amr ibn al as or umar this canal was reportedly linked to the river nile at old cairo and ended near modern suez a geography treatise de mensura orbis terrae written by the irish monk dicuil born late th century reports a conversation with another monk fidelis who had sailed on the canal from the nile to the red sea during a pilgrimage to the holy land in the first half of the th century the abbasid caliph al mansur is said to have ordered this canal closed in to prevent supplies from reaching arabian detractors al hakim bi amr allah is claimed to have repaired the cairo to red sea passageway but only briefly circa ce as it soon became choked with sand however parts of this canal still continued to fill in during the nile s annual inundations the successful navigation of southern africa by bartolomeu dias opened a direct maritime trading route to india and the spice islands and forever changed the balance of mediterranean trade one of the most prominent losers in the new order as former middlemen was the former spice trading center of venice venetian leaders driven to desperation contemplated digging a waterway between the red sea and the nile anticipating the suez canal by almost years to bring the luxury trade flooding to their doors again but this remained a dream despite entering negotiations with egypt s ruling mamelukes the venetian plan to build the canal was quickly put to rest by the ottoman conquest of egypt in led by sultan selim i during the th century the ottoman grand vizier sokollu mehmed pasha attempted to construct a canal connecting the red sea and the mediterranean this was motivated by a desire to connect constantinople to the pilgrimage and trade routes of the indian ocean as well as by strategic concerns as the european presence in the indian ocean was growing ottoman mercantile and strategic interests were increasingly challenged and the sublime porte was increasingly pressed to assert its position a navigable canal would allow the ottoman navy to connect its red sea black sea and mediterranean fleets however this project was deemed too expensive and was never completed during the french campaign in egypt and syria in late napoleon expressed interest in finding the remnants of an ancient waterway passage this culminated in a cadre of archaeologists scientists cartographers and engineers scouring northern egypt their findings recorded in the description de l gypte include detailed maps that depict the discovery of an ancient canal extending northward from the red sea and then westward toward the nile later napoleon who became the french emperor in contemplated the construction of a north south canal to connect the mediterranean with the red sea but the plan was abandoned because it incorrectly concluded that the waterway would require locks to operate the construction of which would be costly and time consuming the belief in the need for locks was based on the erroneous belief that the red sea was m ft higher than the mediterranean this was the result of using fragmentary survey measurements taken in wartime during napoleon s egyptian expedition as late as the unnavigable ancient route discovered by napoleon from bubastis to the red sea still channelled water as far east as kassassin despite the construction challenges that could have been the result of the alleged difference in sea levels the idea of finding a shorter route to the east remained alive in general francis chesney submitted a report to the british government that stated that there was no difference in elevation and that the suez canal was feasible but his report received no further attention lieutenant waghorn established his overland route which transported post and passengers to india via egypt linant de bellefonds a french explorer of egypt became chief engineer of egypt s public works in addition to his normal duties he surveyed the isthmus of suez and made plans for the suez canal french saint simonianists showed an interest in the canal and in barth lemy prosper enfantin tried to draw muhammad ali s attention to the canal but was unsuccessful alois negrelli the italian austrian railroad pioneer became interested in the idea in in prosper enfantin s soci t d tudes du canal de suez invited a number of experts among them robert stephenson negrelli and paul adrien bourdaloue to study the feasibility of the suez canal with the assistance of linant de bellefonds bourdaloue s survey of the isthmus was the first generally accepted evidence that there was no practical difference in altitude between the two seas britain however feared that a canal open to everyone might interfere with its india trade and therefore preferred a connection by train from alexandria via cairo to suez which stephenson eventually built in and ferdinand de lesseps obtained a concession from sa id pasha the khedive of egypt and sudan to create a company to construct a canal open to ships of all nations the company was to operate the canal for years from its opening de lesseps had used his friendly relationship with sa id which he had developed while he was a french diplomat in the s as stipulated in the concessions de lesseps convened the international commission for the piercing of the isthmus of suez commission internationale pour le percement de l isthme de suez consisting of experts from seven countries among them john robinson mcclean later president of the institution of civil engineers in london and again negrelli to examine the plans developed by linant de bellefonds and to advise on the feasibility of and the best route for the canal after surveys and analyses in egypt and discussions in paris on various aspects of the canal where many of negrelli s ideas prevailed the commission produced a unanimous report in december containing a detailed description of the canal complete with plans and profiles the suez canal company compagnie universelle du canal maritime de suez came into being on december the british government had opposed the project from the outset to its completion the british who controlled both the cape route and the overland route to india and the far east favored the status quo given that a canal might disrupt their commercial and maritime supremacy lord palmerston the project s most unwavering foe confessed in the mid s the real motive behind his opposition that britain s commercial and maritime relations would be overthrown by the opening of a new route open to all nations and thus deprive his country of its present exclusive advantages as one of the diplomatic moves against the project when it nevertheless went ahead it disapproved of the use of forced labour for construction of the canal involuntary labour on the project ceased and the viceroy condemned the corv e halting the project initially international opinion was sceptical and suez canal company shares did not sell well overseas britain austria and russia did not buy a significant number of shares with assistance from the cattaui banking family and their relationship with james de rothschild of the french house of rothschild bonds and shares were successfully promoted in france and other parts of europe all french shares were quickly sold in france a contemporary british skeptic claimed one thing is sure our local merchant community doesn t pay practical attention at all to this grand work and it is legitimate to doubt that the canal s receipts could ever be sufficient to recover its maintenance fee it will never become a large ship s accessible way in any case work started on the shore of the future port said on april the excavation took some years with forced labour corv e being employed until to dig out the canal some sources estimate that over people were working on the canal at any given period that more than million people from various countries were employed and that tens of thousands of labourers died many of them from cholera and similar epidemics estimates of the number of deaths vary widely with gamal abdel nasser citing deaths upon nationalisation of the canal in a july speech and the company s chief medical officer reporting no higher than deaths per thousand in doubling these estimates with a generous assumption of working staff per year over years would put a conservative estimate at fewer than deaths more closely relying on the limited reported data of the time the number would be fewer than the canal opened under french control in november the opening ceremonies began at port said on the evening of november with illuminations fireworks and a banquet on the yacht of the khedive isma il pasha of egypt and sudan the royal guests arrived the following morning the emperor franz joseph i the french empress eugenie in the imperial yacht l aigle the crown prince of prussia and prince louis of hesse other international guests included the american natural historian h w harkness in the afternoon there were blessings of the canal with both muslim and christian ceremonies a temporary mosque and church having been built side by side on the beach in the evening there were more illuminations and fireworks on the morning of november a procession of ships entered the canal headed by the l aigle among the ships following was hms newport captained by george nares which surveyed the canal on behalf of the admiralty a few months later the newport was involved in an incident that demonstrated some of the problems with the canal there were suggestions that the depth of parts of the canal at the time of the inauguration were not as great as promised and that the deepest part of the channel was not always clear leading to a risk of grounding the first day of the passage ended at lake timsah kilometres nmi south of port said the french ship p luse anchored close to the entrance then swung around and grounded the ship and its hawser blocking the way into the lake the following ships had to anchor in the canal itself until the p luse was hauled clear the next morning making it difficult for them to join that night s celebration in ismailia except for the newport nares sent out a boat to carry out soundings and was able to manoeuver around the p luse to enter the lake and anchor there for the night ismailia was the scene of more celebrations the following day including a military march past illuminations and fireworks and a ball at the governor s palace the convoy set off again on the morning of november for the remainder of the trip to suez after suez many of the participants headed for cairo and then to the pyramids where a new road had been built for the occasion an anchor line ship the s s dido became the first to pass through the canal from south to north although numerous technical political and financial problems had been overcome the final cost was more than double the original estimate the khedive in particular was able to overcome initial reservations held by both british and french creditors by enlisting the help of the sursock family whose deep connections proved invaluable in securing much international support for the project after the opening the suez canal company was in financial difficulties the remaining works were completed only in and traffic was below expectations in the first two years de lesseps therefore tried to increase revenues by interpreting the kind of net ton referred to in the second concession tonneau de capacit as meaning a ship s cargo capacity and not only the theoretical net tonnage of the moorsom system introduced in britain by the merchant shipping act in the ensuing commercial and diplomatic activities resulted in the international commission of constantinople establishing a specific kind of net tonnage and settling the question of tariffs in its protocol of december this was the origin of the suez canal net tonnage and the suez canal special tonnage certificate both of which are still in use today the canal had an immediate and dramatic effect on world trade combined with the american transcontinental railroad completed six months earlier it allowed the world to be circled in record time it played an important role in increasing european colonization of africa the construction of the canal was one of the reasons for the panic of in great britain because goods from the far east had until then been carried in sailing vessels around the cape of good hope and stored in british warehouses an inability to pay his bank debts led said pasha s successor isma il pasha in to sell his share in the canal for million equivalent to million to million million to million in to the government of the united kingdom french shareholders still held the majority local unrest caused the british to invade in and take full control although nominally egypt remained part of the ottoman empire the british representative from to was evelyn baring st earl of cromer who reorganized and modernized the government and suppressed rebellions and corruption thereby facilitating increased traffic on the canal the european mediterranean countries in particular benefited economically from the suez canal as they now had much faster connections to asia and east africa than the north and west european maritime trading nations such as great britain the netherlands or germany the biggest beneficiary in the mediterranean was austria hungary which had participated in the planning and construction of the canal the largest austrian maritime trading company sterreichischer lloyd experienced rapid expansion after the canal was completed as did the port city of trieste then an austrian possession the company was a partner in the compagnie universelle du canal de suez whose vice president was the lloyd co founder pasquale revoltella the convention of constantinople in declared the canal a neutral zone under the protection of the british who had occupied egypt and sudan at the request of khedive tewfiq to suppress the urabi revolt against his rule the revolt went on from to the british defended the strategically important passage against a major ottoman attack in during the first world war under the anglo egyptian treaty of the uk retained control over the canal with outbreak of world war ii the canal was again strategically important italo german attempts to capture it were repulsed during the north africa campaign which ensured the canal remained closed to axis shipping in egypt repudiated the treaty with great britain in october the uk tentatively agreed to remove its troops from the canal zone because of egyptian overtures towards the soviet union both the united kingdom and the united states withdrew their pledge to financially support construction of the aswan dam egyptian president gamal abdel nasser responded by nationalising the canal on july and transferring it to the suez canal authority intending to finance the dam project using revenue from the canal on the same day that the canal was nationalised nasser also closed the straits of tiran to all israeli ships this led to the suez crisis in which the uk france and israel invaded egypt according to the pre agreed war plans under the protocol of s vres israel invaded the sinai peninsula on october forcing egypt to engage them militarily and allowing the anglo french partnership to declare the resultant fighting a threat to stability in the middle east and enter the war officially to separate the two forces but in reality to regain the canal and bring down the nasser government to save the british from what he thought was a disastrous action and to stop the war from a possible escalation canadian secretary of state for external affairs lester b pearson proposed the creation of the first united nations peacekeeping force to ensure access to the canal for all and an israeli withdrawal from the sinai peninsula on november a majority at the united nations voted for pearson s peacekeeping resolution which mandated the un peacekeepers to stay in sinai unless both egypt and israel agreed to their withdrawal the united states backed this proposal by putting pressure on the british government through the selling of sterling which would cause it to depreciate britain then called a ceasefire and later agreed to withdraw its troops by the end of the year pearson was later awarded the nobel peace prize as a result of damage and ships sunk under orders from nasser the canal was closed until april when it was cleared with un assistance a un force unef was established to maintain the free navigability of the canal and peace in the sinai peninsula prior to the war egypt had repeatedly closed the canal to israeli shipping as a defensive measure refusing to open the canal in and during the suez crisis egypt did so despite un security council resolutions from and urging it not to claiming that hostilities had ended with the armistice agreement on may when nasser ordered the unef peacekeeping forces out of the sinai peninsula including the suez canal area egyptian troops were sent into sinai to take their place israel protested nasser s order to close the straits of tiran to israeli trade on may the same year this halted israeli shipping between the port of eilat and the red sea after the six day war israeli forces occupied the sinai peninsula including the entire east bank of the suez canal in the following years the tensions between egypt and israeli intensified and from march until august a war of attrition took place as the then egyptian president gamal abdel nasser tried to retake the territories occupied by israel during the conflict the fighting ceased after the death of nasser in after this conflict there were no changes in the distribution of territory but the underlying tensions persisted unwilling to allow the israelis to use the canal egypt immediately imposed a blockade which closed the canal to all shipping immediately after the beginning of the six day war the canal remained blocked for eight years there was no anticipation of this event and consequently fifteen cargo ships known as the yellow fleet were trapped in the canal and remained there until its reopening in on october during the yom kippur war the canal was the scene of the operation badr in which the egyptian military crossed the suez canal into israeli occupied sinai peninsula much wreckage from this conflict remains visible along the canal s edges arab oil exporters sympathetic to egypt pushed opec to raise the price of crude oil by around percent and eventually imposed an embargo against the united states and other israeli allies after the yom kippur war the united states initiated operation nimbus moon the amphibious assault ship uss inchon lph was sent to the canal carrying rh d minesweeping helicopters of helicopter mine countermeasures squadron these partly cleared the canal between may and december she was relieved by the lst uss barnstable county lst the british royal navy initiated operation rheostat and task group provided for operation rheostat one six months in the minehunters hms maxton hms bossington and hms wilton the fleet clearance diving team fcdt and hms abdiel a practice minelayer mcmv support ship and for operation rheostat two six months in the minehunters hms hubberston and hms sheraton and hms abdiel when the canal clearance operations were completed the canal and its lakes were considered clear of mines the canal was then reopened by egyptian president anwar sadat aboard an egyptian destroyer which led the first convoy northbound to port said in at his side stood the iranian crown prince reza pahlavi the unef mandate expired in despite the efforts of the united states israel egypt and others to obtain an extension of the un role in observing the peace between israel and egypt as called for under the egypt israel peace treaty of the mandate could not be extended because of the veto by the soviet union in the un security council at the request of syria accordingly negotiations for a new observer force in the sinai produced the multinational force and observers mfo stationed in sinai in in coordination with a phased israeli withdrawal the mfo remains active under agreements between the united states israel egypt and other nations in months after taking office as president of egypt abdel fattah el sisi ordered the expansion of the ballah bypass from metres ft wide to metres ft wide for kilometres mi the project was called the new suez canal as it allows ships to transit the canal in both directions simultaneously the project cost more than le billion us billion and was completed within a year sisi declared the expanded channel open to business in a ceremony on august on march at around utc local time the suez canal was blocked in both directions by the ultra large evergreen g class container ship ever given the ship operated by evergreen marine was en route from malaysia to the netherlands when it ran aground after strong winds allegedly blew the ship off course upon running aground ever given turned sideways completely blocking the canal although part of the length of the canal is paralleled by an older narrower channel which can be used to bypass obstructions this incident occurred south of that area in a section of the canal where there is only one channel the site was located at n e n e when the incident began many economists and trade experts commented on the effects of the obstruction if not resolved quickly citing how important the suez was to global trade the incident was likely to drastically affect the global economy because of the trapped goods scheduled to go through the canal among those goods oil shipments were the most affected in the immediate aftermath due to a significant number still blocked with no other way to reach their destination referring to the european and american market a few maritime experts have disputed the prediction of a drastic effect on trade saying this really isn t a substantial transit route for crude according to marshall steeves energy markets analyst at ihs markit and there are existing stocks according to camille egloff of boston consulting group and alternative sources of supply noting that traffic only slowed down and that it might only have impacted sectors with existing shortages such as the semiconductor industry the international chamber of shipping ics estimates that up to billion worth of cargo passes through the suez canal every day it was said the blockage would have an impact on cargo schedules around the world shipping companies were also considering whether to divert their ships along the much longer route around the cape of good hope the first container ship to do so was ever given s sister ship ever greet the ship was re floated on march within a few hours cargo traffic resumed slowly resolving the backlog of around ships the first ship to successfully pass through the canal after the ever given s recovery was the ym wish a hong kong based cargo ship on april usama rabie chairman of the suez canal authority of egypt said that the damage caused by the blockage of the canal could reach about billion rabie also revealed that after the suez canal resumed navigation as of noon on march cargo ships had passed through the canal smoothly he said that the remaining freighters waiting to pass through the canal would all pass by april after the incident the egyptian government announced that they would be widening the narrower parts of the canal on september the canal was briefly blocked again by the mv coral crystal however this ship was freed within minutes presenting minimal disruption to other convoys suez canal in february air photograph taken by swiss pilot and photographer walter mittelholzer uss america cv an american aircraft carrier in the suez canal container ship hanjin kaohsiung transiting the suez canal when built the canal was km mi long and m ft deep after several enlargements it is km mi long m ft deep and metres ft wide it consists of the northern access channel of km mi the canal itself of km mi and the southern access channel of km mi the so called new suez canal functional since august currently has a new parallel canal in the middle part with its length over km mi the current parameters of the suez canal including both individual canals of the parallel section are depth to metres to ft and width at least to metres to ft that width measured at metres ft of depth the canal allows passage of ships up to m ft draft or deadweight tons and up to a height of m ft above water level and a maximum beam of m ft under certain conditions the canal can handle more traffic and larger ships than the panama canal as suezmax dimensions are greater than both panamax and new panamax some supertankers are too large to traverse the canal others can offload part of their cargo onto a canal owned ship to reduce their draft transit and reload at the other end of the canal on april egyptian authorities announced that they would widen the southern section of the suez canal to improve the efficiency of the canal the plan mainly covers about kilometres mi from suez to the great bitter lake it will be widened by metres ft and the maximum depth will be increased from about metres ft to about metres ft ships approaching the canal from the sea are expected to radio the harbour when they are within nautical miles kilometres of the fairway buoy near port said the canal has no locks because of the flat terrain and the minor sea level difference between each end is inconsequential for shipping as the canal has no sea surge gates the ports at the ends would be subject to the sudden impact of tsunamis from the mediterranean sea and red sea according to a article in the journal of coastal research there is one shipping lane with passing areas in ballah bypass near el qantara and in the great bitter lake on a typical day three convoys transit the canal two southbound and one northbound the passage takes between and hours at a speed of around knots km h mph the low speed helps prevent erosion of the banks by ships wakes by about two thirds of europe s oil passed through the canal around of world sea trade is carried via the canal in vessels passed through the canal and the receipts totalled billion with an average cost per ship of new rules of navigation came into force on january passed by the board of directors of the suez canal authority sca to organise vessels transit the most important amendments include allowing vessels with metre ft draught to pass increasing the allowed breadth from to metres to ft following improvement operations and imposing a fine on vessels using pilots from outside the sca inside the canal boundaries without permission the amendments allow vessels loaded with dangerous cargo such as radioactive or flammable materials to pass if they conform with the latest amendments provided by international conventions the sca has the right to determine the number of tugs required to assist warships traversing the canal to achieve the highest degree of safety during transit ships moored at el ballah during transit predominant currents in the mediterranean sea for june before august the canal was too narrow for free two way traffic so ships had to pass in convoys and use bypasses the bypasses were km mi out of km mi from north to south they are port said bypass entrances km mi ballah bypass anchorage km mi timsah bypass km mi and the deversoir bypass northern end of the great bitter lake km mi the bypasses were completed in typically it would take a ship to hours to transit the canal the canal s hour capacity was about standard ships in august egypt chose a consortium that includes the egyptian army and global engineering firm dar al handasah to develop an international industrial and logistics hub in the suez canal area and began the construction of a new canal section from to km to mi combined with expansion and deep digging of the other kilometres mi of the canal this will allow navigation in both directions simultaneously in the kilometre long mi central section of the canal these extensions were formally opened on august by president al sisi post deepening a capesize bulk carrier approaches the friendship bridge northbound convoy waits in the great bitter lake as southbound convoy passes october since the canal does not cater to unregulated two way traffic all ships transit in convoys on regular times scheduled on a hour basis each day a single northbound convoy starts at from suez at dual lane sections the convoy uses the eastern route synchronised with this convoy s passage is the southbound convoy it starts at from port said and so passes the northbound convoy in the two lane section clarification needed from north to south the crossings are a railway on the west bank runs parallel to the canal for its entire length the five pontoon bridges were opened between and they are designed to be movable and can be completely rotated against the banks of the canal to allow shipping through or else individual sections can be moved to create a narrower channel six new tunnels for cars and trains are also planned across the canal currently the ahmed hamdi is the only tunnel connecting suez to the sinai economically after its completion the suez canal benefited primarily the sea trading powers of the mediterranean countries which now had much faster connections to the near and far east than the north and west european sea trading nations such as great britain or germany the main habsburg trading port of trieste with its direct connections to central europe experienced a meteoric rise at that time the time saved in the th century for an assumed steamship trip to bombay from brindisi and trieste was days from genoa from marseille from bordeaux liverpool london amsterdam and hamburg days at that time it was also necessary to consider whether the goods to be transported could bear the costly canal tariff this led to a rapid growth of mediterranean ports with their land routes to central and eastern europe according to today s information from the shipping companies the route from singapore to rotterdam through the suez canal will be shortened by kilometres mi and thus by nine days compared to the route around africa as a result liner services between asia and europe save percent co carbon dioxide thanks to this shorter route the suez canal has a correspondingly important role in the connection between east africa and the mediterranean region in the th century trade through the suez canal came to a standstill several times due to the two world wars and the suez canal crisis many trade flows were also shifted away from the mediterranean ports towards northern european terminals such as hamburg and rotterdam only after the end of the cold war the growth in european economic integration the consideration of co emission and the chinese silk road initiative are mediterranean ports such as piraeus and trieste again at the focus of growth and investment before the canal s opening in goods were sometimes offloaded from ships and carried overland between the mediterranean and the red sea the main alternative is around cape agulhas the southernmost point of africa commonly referred to as the cape of good hope route this was the only sea route before the canal was constructed and when the canal was closed it is still the only route for ships that are too large for the canal in the early st century the suez canal has suffered from diminished traffic due to piracy in somalia with many shipping companies choosing to take the long route instead between and it is estimated that the canal lost of traffic due to the threat of piracy and another due to the financial crisis an oil tanker going from saudi arabia to the united states has km mi farther to go when taking the route south of africa rather than the canal in recent years the shrinking arctic sea ice has made the northern sea route feasible for commercial cargo ships between europe and east asia during a six to eight week window in the summer months shortening the voyage by thousands of kilometres compared to that through the suez canal according to polar climate researchers as the extent of the arctic summer ice pack recedes the route will become passable without the help of icebreakers for a greater period each summer the bremen based beluga group claimed in to be the first western company to attempt using the northern sea route without assistance from icebreakers cutting kilometres mi off the journey between ulsan korea and rotterdam the netherlands sailing ships such as the windjammers in the heyday of the great grain race between australia and europe during the s often preferred the cape horn route when going to europe due to prevalent wind directions even though it is slightly longer from sydney to europe this way than past cape agulhas in february israel announced its intention to construct a railway between the mediterranean and eilat through the negev desert to compete with the canal by the project had been indefinitely frozen the opening of the canal created the first salt water passage between the mediterranean sea and the red sea although the red sea is about m ft higher than the eastern mediterranean the current between the mediterranean and the middle of the canal at the bitter lakes flows north in winter and south in summer the current south of the bitter lakes is tidal varying with the tide at suez the bitter lakes which were hypersaline natural lakes blocked the migration of red sea species into the mediterranean for many decades but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the red sea the barrier to migration was removed and plants and animals from the red sea have begun to colonise the eastern mediterranean citation needed the red sea is generally saltier and less nutrient rich than the mediterranean so that erythrean species will often do well in the milder eastern mediterranean environment to the contrary very few mediterranean species have been able to settle in the harsher conditions of the red sea the dominant south to north migratory passage across the canal is often called lessepsian migration after ferdinand de lesseps or erythrean invasion the recent construction by the egyptian government of a major canal extension allowing for two way traffic in the central section of the canal and finally implemented in raised concerns from marine biologists who fear that it will enhance the arrival of red sea species in the mediterranean exotic species from the indo pacific ocean and introduced into the mediterranean via the canal since the s have become a significant component of the mediterranean ecosystem they already impact its ecology endangering some local and endemic species since the piercing of the canal over a thousand species from the red sea plankton seaweeds invertebrates fishes have been recorded in the mediterranean and many others will clearly follow the resulting change in biodiversity is without precedent in human memory and is accelerating a long term cross basin survey engaged by the mediterranean science commission recently documented that in the first twenty years of this century more exotic fish species from the indian ocean had reached the mediterranean than during the entire th century historically the construction of the canal was preceded by cutting a small fresh water canal called sweet water canal from the nile delta along wadi tumilat to the future canal with a southern branch to suez and a northern branch to port said completed in these brought fresh water to a previously arid area initially for canal construction and subsequently facilitating growth of agriculture and settlements along the canal however the aswan high dam construction across the nile which started operating in much reduced the inflow of freshwater and cut all natural nutrient rich silt entering the eastern mediterranean at the nile delta the suez canal economic zone sometimes shortened to sczone describes the set of locations neighbouring the canal where customs rates have been reduced to zero in order to attract investment the zone comprises over km sq mi within the governorates of port said ismailia and suez projects in the zone are collectively described as the suez canal area development project scadp the plan focuses on development of east port said and the port of ain sokhna and hopes to extend to four more ports at west port said el adabiya arish and el tor the zone incorporates the four qualifying industrial zones at port said ismailia and suez a american initiative to encourage economic ties between israel and its neighbours

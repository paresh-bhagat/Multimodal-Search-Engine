maximum capacity of inmates with a current population as of june of inmates usp adx florence houses male inmates in the federal prison system deemed the most dangerous and in need of the tightest control including prisoners whose escape would pose a serious threat to national security the bop does not have a designated supermax facility for women women in the bop system classified as special management concerns due to violence or escape attempts are confined in the administrative unit of federal medical center carswell in fort worth texas in thomas silverstein and clayton fountain members of the aryan brotherhood fatally stabbed correctional officers merle clutts and robert hoffman at the united states penitentiary marion the stabbings took place only a few hours apart and were blamed on inadequate prison design federal bureau of prisons director norman carlson argued for the creation of a new type of facility where the most dangerous uncontrollable inmates could be isolated from correction officers and other prisoners for security and safety under his guidance the united states penitentiary marion was operated in permanent lockdown for the next two decades it became a model for the design of adx as a control unit prison carlson said that such a prison would hold criminals desperate enough to murder corrections officers or other inmates in the hopes of being sentenced to death he argued that as draconian as these measures were they were the only way to deal with inmates who have absolutely no concern for human life usp adx florence opened on january the county already had nine prisons but the lure of to permanent jobs plus temporary jobs during the prison s construction led residents to raise to purchase acres ha for the new prison hundreds of people attended the groundbreaking for the facility which was designed by two leading architecture firms in colorado springs and cost million to build the supermax unit at usp adx florence houses male inmates each assigned to one of six security levels it is designed for inmates but has never been at full capacity the facility is best known for housing inmates who have been deemed too dangerous too high profile or too great a security risk for even maximum security prisons for example joseph romano was sentenced to life in federal prison for plotting to murder the judge and federal prosecutor who helped sentence him to years in prison for masterminding a coin fraud operation while in prison he plotted to murder an undercover officer who had taken part in the investigation when this came to light romano was transferred to usp adx florence the majority of current inmates however have been placed there because each has an extensive history in other prisons of committing violent crimes including murder against corrections officers and fellow inmates these inmates are kept in administrative segregation they are confined in a single person cell for hours a day and are removed under restraint handcuffed shackled or both their one hour out of their cell may occur at any time of the day or night the hour outside of the cell is for exercise and a phone call if they have earned the privilege their diet is restricted to ensure that the food cannot be used to harm themselves or to create unhygienic conditions in their cell some cells have showers which further reduces the amount of handling of inmates that correctional officers have to perform after at least one year depending on their conduct inmates are gradually allowed out for longer periods the long term goal is to keep them at usp adx florence for no more than three years and then to transfer them to a less restrictive prison to serve the remainder of their sentences according to a report in the san francisco chronicle usp adx florence s main purpose is to try and extract reasonably peaceful behavior from extremely violent career prisoners one cell block at florence was once known as bombers row because four notable terrorists three of whom are domestic terrorists were held there terry nichols ramzi yousef eric rudolph and ted kaczynski despite the extreme security measures to deter disruptive violent and dangerous behavior among inmates there have been murders at adx silvestre rivera and richard santiago were both charged with the first degree murder of manuel torres a high level member of the mexican mafia left alone with no guard supervision in the prison yard on the morning of april rivera and santiago were videotaped brutally beating and stomping torres to death rivera pled not guilty due to self defense prosecutors intended to seek the death penalty against rivera and santiago but they were both given life sentences for the murders today santiago remains incarcerated at adx while rivera is currently serving his life sentence in usp hazleton in january a british judge ruled that julian assange could not be extradited to the us on the grounds that assange would likely be housed at adx where there was a high risk he would commit suicide due to the conditions at the facility this ruling was later overturned on appeal in december adx florence is a acre ha complex located at highway in

a television that shows recreational educational and religious programming the inch by foot cm m windows are designed to prevent inmates from knowing their specific location within the complex they

knowing their location in the facility the pit is large enough only for a prisoner to walk ten steps in a straight line or thirty one steps in a circle correctional officers generally deliver food to the cells inmates transferred to usp adx florence from other prisons may be allowed to eat in a shared dining room the prison as a whole contains a multitude of motion detectors cameras and remote controlled steel doors officers in the prison s control center monitor inmates twenty four hours a day and can activate a panic button which immediately closes every door in the facility should an escape attempt be suspected pressure pads and foot m razor wire fences surround the perimeter which is patrolled by heavily armed officers the facility houses inmates at six differing security levels general population units delta echo fox and golf units the special housing unit shu the special security unit h unit the control unit intermediate transitional units kilo and joker units and range

other inmates from there inmates will typically be transferred to the supermax step down unit in usp florence high the bureau of prisons allowed the media to take a guided tour of usp adx florence on

lawsuit at least six inmates had allegedly died by suicide a seventh did so after the original lawsuit was filed and an amended filing added him to the case critics claim that the use of extended confinement in solitary cells adversely affects prisoners mental health numerous studies support this conclusion citation needed as of march update settlement negotiations were underway with the help

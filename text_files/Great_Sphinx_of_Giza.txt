 the great sphinx of giza is a limestone statue of a reclining sphinx a mythical creature with the head of a human and the body of a lion facing directly from west to east it stands on the giza plateau on the west bank of the nile in giza egypt the face of the sphinx appears to represent the pharaoh khafre the original shape of the sphinx was cut from the bedrock and has since been restored with layers of limestone blocks it measures m ft long from paw to tail m ft high from the base to the top of the head and m ft wide at its rear haunches its nose was broken off for unknown reasons between the rd and th centuries ad the sphinx is the oldest known monumental sculpture in egypt and one of the most recognisable statues in the world the archaeological evidence suggests that it was created by ancient egyptians of the old kingdom during the reign of khafre c bc the original name the old kingdom creators gave the sphinx is unknown as the sphinx temple enclosure and possibly the sphinx itself was not completed at the time thus cultural material was limited in the new kingdom the sphinx was revered as the solar deity hor em akhet english horus of the horizon hellenized harmachis and the pharaoh thutmose iv or bc a specifically referred to it as such in his dream stele the commonly used name sphinx was given to it in classical antiquity about years after the commonly accepted date of its construction by reference to a greek mythological beast with the head of a woman a falcon a cat or a sheep and the body of a lion with the wings of an eagle although like most egyptian sphinxes the great sphinx has a man s head and no wings the english word sphinx comes from the ancient greek transliterated sphinx apparently from the verb transliterated sphingo english to squeeze after the greek sphinx who strangled anyone who failed to answer her riddle citation needed medieval arab writers including al maqr z call the sphinx by an arabized coptic name belhib arabic and belhawiyya arabic which in turn comes from ancient egyptian p wr a name of the canaanite god hauron with whom the sphinx was identified the modern egyptian arabic name is abu alh l abu alhawl ipa abulho l the terrifying one literally father of dread which is a phono semantic matching of the coptic name the archaeological evidence suggests that the great sphinx was created around bc for the pharaoh khafre the builder of the second pyramid at giza the sphinx is a monolith carved from the bedrock of the plateau which also served as the quarry for the pyramids and other monuments in the area egyptian geologist farouk el baz has suggested that the head of the sphinx may have been carved first out of a natural yardang i e a ridge of bedrock that had been sculpted by the wind these can sometimes achieve shapes which resemble animals el baz suggests that the moat or ditch around the sphinx may have been quarried out later to allow for the creation of the full body of the sculpture the stones cut from around the sphinx body were used to construct a temple in front of it however neither the enclosure nor the temple were ever completed and the relative scarcity of old kingdom cultural material suggests that a sphinx cult was not established at the time selim hassan writing in on recent excavations of the sphinx enclosure made note of this circumstance taking all things into consideration it seems that we must give the credit of erecting this the world s most wonderful statue to khafre but always with this reservation that there is not one single contemporary inscription which connects the sphinx with khafre so sound as it may appear we must treat the evidence as circumstantial until such time as a lucky turn of the spade of the excavator will reveal to the world a definite reference to the erection of the sphinx in order to construct the temple the northern perimeter wall of the khafre valley temple had to be deconstructed hence it follows that the khafre funerary complex preceded the creation of the sphinx and its temple furthermore the angle and location of the south wall of the enclosure suggests the causeway connecting khafre s pyramid and valley temple already existed before the sphinx was planned the lower base level of the sphinx temple also indicates that it doesn t pre date the valley temple some time around the first intermediate period the giza necropolis was abandoned and drifting sand eventually buried the sphinx up to its shoulders the first documented attempt at an excavation dates to c bc when the young thutmose iv or bc gathered a team and after much effort managed to dig out the front paws between which he erected a shrine that housed the dream stele an inscribed granite slab possibly a repurposed door lintel from one of khafre s temples when the stele was discovered its lines of text were already damaged and incomplete an excerpt reads the royal son thothmos being arrived while walking at midday and seating himself under the shadow of this mighty god was overcome by slumber and slept at the very moment when ra is at the summit of heaven he found that the majesty of this august god spoke to him with his own mouth as a father speaks to his son saying look upon me contemplate me o my son thothmos i am thy father harmakhis khopri ra tum i bestow upon thee the sovereignty over my domain the supremacy over the living behold my actual condition that thou mayest protect all my perfect limbs the sand of the desert whereon i am laid has covered me save me causing all that is in my heart to be executed the dream stele associates the sphinx with khafre however this part of the text is not entirely intact which we bring for him oxen and all the young vegetables and we shall give praise to wenofer khaf the statue made for atum hor em akhet egyptologist thomas young finding the khaf hieroglyphs in a damaged cartouche used to surround a royal name inserted the glyph ra to complete khafre s name when the stele was re excavated in the lines of text referring to khaf flaked off and were destroyed citation needed later ramesses ii the great bc may have undertaken a second excavation in the new kingdom the sphinx became more specifically associated with the sun god hor em akhet hellenized harmachis or horus at the horizon pharaoh amenhotep ii or bc built a temple to the northeast of the sphinx nearly years after its construction and dedicated it to the cult of hor em akhet in graeco roman times giza had become a tourist destination the monuments were regarded as antiquities and some roman emperors visited the sphinx out of curiosity and for political reasons the sphinx was cleared of sand again in the first century ad in honor of emperor nero and the governor of egypt tiberius claudius balbilus a monumental stairway more than metres ft wide was erected leading to a pavement in front of the paws of the sphinx at the top of the stairs a podium was positioned that allowed view into the sphinx sanctuary further back another podium neighbored several more steps the stairway was dismantled during the excavations by mile baraize pliny the elder describes the face of the sphinx being colored red and gives measurements for the statue a stela dated to ad commemorates the restoration of the retaining walls surrounding the sphinx the last emperor connected with the monument is septimius severus around ad with the downfall of roman power the sphinx was once more engulfed by the sands side view of the sphinx with the roman stairway on the right top of the roman stairway before dismantling in map of the area east of the sphinx by henry salt some ancient non egyptians saw it as a likeness of the god horon the cult of the sphinx continued into medieval times the sabians of harran saw it as the burial place of hermes trismegistus arab authors described the sphinx as a talisman which guarded the area from the desert al maqrizi describes it as the talisman of the nile of which the locals believed the flood cycle depended upon muhammad al idrisi stated that those wishing to obtain bureaucratic positions in the egyptian government gave incense offering to the monument over the centuries writers and scholars have recorded their impressions and reactions upon seeing the sphinx the vast majority were concerned with a general description often including a mixture of science romance and mystique citation needed a typical citation needed description of the sphinx by tourists and leisure travelers throughout the th and th century was made by john lawson stoddard it is the antiquity of the sphinx which thrills us as we look upon it for in itself it has no charms the desert s waves have risen to its breast as if to wrap the monster in a winding sheet of gold the face and head have been mutilated by moslem fanatics the mouth the beauty of whose lips was once admired is now expressionless yet grand in its loneliness veiled in the mystery of unnamed ages the relic of egyptian antiquity stands solemn and silent in the presence of the awful desert symbol of eternity here it disputes with time the empire of the past forever gazing on and on into a future which will still be distant when we like all who have preceded us and looked upon its face have lived our little lives and disappeared from the th th centuries european observers described the sphinx having the face neck and breast of a woman examples included johannes helferich george sandys johann michael vansleb beno t de maillet and elliot warburton most early western images were book illustrations in print form elaborated by a professional engraver from either previous images available or some original drawing or sketch supplied by an author and usually now lost seven years after

chest the paws the altar and plateau were all made visible flights of steps were unearthed and finally accurate measurements were taken of the great figures the height from the lowest of the steps was found to be one hundred feet and the space between the paws was found to be thirty five feet long and ten feet wide here there was formerly an altar and a stele of th tmosis iv was discovered recording a dream in which he was ordered to clear away the sand that even then was gathering round the site of the sphinx one of the people working on clearing the sands from around the great sphinx was eug ne gr baut a french director of the antiquities service early egyptologists and excavators were of divided opinion regarding the age of the sphinx and the associated temples in auguste mariette founder of the egyptian museum in cairo unearthed the much later inventory stela estimated to be from the twenty sixth dynasty c bc which tells how khufu came upon the sphinx already buried in sand although certain tracts on the stela are likely accurate this passage is contradicted by archaeological evidence thus considered to be late period historical revisionism a purposeful fake created by the local priests as an attempt to imbue the contemporary isis temple with an ancient history it never had such acts became common when religious institutions such as temples shrines and priests domains were fighting for political attention and for financial and economic donations flinders petrie wrote in regarding the state of opinion of the age of the khafre valley temple and by extension the sphinx the date of the granite temple has been so positively asserted to be earlier than the fourth dynasty that it may seem rash to dispute the point recent discoveries however strongly show that it was really not built before the reign of khafre in the fourth dynasty gaston maspero the french egyptologist and second director of the egyptian museum in cairo conducted a survey of the sphinx in he concluded that because the dream stela showed the cartouche of khafre in line it was he who was responsible for the excavation and therefore the sphinx must predate khafre and his predecessors possibly fourth dynasty c bc maspero believed the sphinx to be the most ancient monument in egypt ludwig borchardt attributed the sphinx to the middle kingdom arguing that the particular features seen on the sphinx are unique to the th dynasty and that the sphinx resembles amenemhat iii e a wallis budge agreed that the sphinx predated khafre s reign writing in the gods of the egyptians this marvelous object the great sphinx was in existence in the days of khafre or khephren b and it is probable that it is a very great deal older than his reign and that it dates from the end of the archaic period c bc selim hassan reasoned that the sphinx was erected after the completion of the khafre pyramid complex rainer stadelmann former director of the german archaeological institute in cairo examined the distinct iconography of the nemes headdress and the now detached beard of the sphinx and concluded the style is more indicative of the pharaoh khufu bc known to the greeks as cheops builder of the great pyramid of giza and khafre s father he supports this by suggesting khafre s causeway was built to conform to a pre existing structure which he concludes given its location could only have been the sphinx in vassil dobrev of the institut fran ais d arch ologie orientale in cairo announced he had uncovered new evidence that the great sphinx may have been the work of the little known pharaoh djedefre bc khafra s half brother and a son of khufu dobrev suggests djedefre built the sphinx in the image of his father khufu identifying him with the sun god ra in order to restore respect for their dynasty dobrev also says that the causeway connecting khafre s pyramid to the temples was built around the sphinx suggesting it was already in existence at the time egyptologist nigel strudwick responded to dobrev saying that it is not implausible but i would need more explanation such as why he thinks the pyramid at abu roash is a sun temple something i m sceptical about i have never heard anyone suggest that the name in the graffiti at zawiyet el aryan mentions djedefre i remain more convinced by the traditional argument of it being khafre or the more recent theory of it being khufu in engineers of the egyptian government repaired the head of the sphinx part of its headdress had fallen off in due to erosion which had also cut deeply into its neck this questionable repair was by the addition of a concrete collar between the headdress and the neck creating an altered profile many renovations to the stone base and raw rock body were done in the s and then redone in the s the nummulitic limestone of the area consists of layers which offer differing resistance to erosion mostly caused by wind and windblown sand leading to the uneven degradation apparent in the sphinx s body the lowest part of the body including the legs is solid rock the body of the animal up to its neck is fashioned from softer layers that have suffered considerable disintegration the layer in which the head was sculpted is much harder a number of dead end shafts are known to exist within and below the body of the great sphinx most likely dug by treasure hunters and tomb robbers examination of the sphinx s face shows that long rods or chisels were hammered into the nose area one down from the bridge and another beneath the nostril then used to pry the nose off towards the south resulting in the one metre wide nose still being lost to date mark lehner who performed an archaeological study concluded that it was intentionally broken with instruments at an unknown time between the rd and th centuries ad drawings of the sphinx by frederic louis norden in show the nose missing many folk tales exist regarding the destruction of its nose aiming to provide an answer as to where it went or what happened to it one tale erroneously attributes it to cannonballs fired by the army of napoleon bonaparte other tales ascribe it to being the work of mamluks since the th century some arab authors have claimed it to be a result of iconoclastic attacks the arab historian al maqr z writing in the th century attributes the loss of the nose to muhammad sa im al dahr a sufi muslim from the khanqah of sa id al su ada in who found the local peasants making offerings to the sphinx in the hope of increasing their harvest and therefore defaced the sphinx in an act of iconoclasm according to al maqr z many people living in the area believed that the increased sand covering the giza plateau was retribution for al dahr s act of defacement ibn qadi shuhba mentions his name as muhammad ibn sadiq ibn al muhammad al tibrizi al masri who died in he attributed the desecration of the sphinxes of qanatir al siba built by the sultan baybars to him and also said he might have desecrated the great sphinx al minufi stated that the alexandrian crusade in was divine punishment for a sufi sheikh of the khanqah of sa id breaking off the nose in addition to the lost nose a ceremonial pharaonic beard is thought to have been attached although this may have been added in later periods after the original construction egyptologist vassil dobrev has suggested that had the beard been an original part of the sphinx it would have damaged the chin of the statue upon falling the lack of visible damage supports his theory that the beard was a later addition citation needed residues of red pigment are visible on areas of the sphinx s face and traces of yellow and blue pigment have also been found elsewhere on the sphinx leading mark lehner to suggest that the monument was once decked out in gaudy comic book colours however as with the case of many ancient monuments the pigments and colours have since deteriorated resulting in the yellow beige appearance it has today johann helffrich visited the sphinx during his travels in he describes that a priest went into the head of the sphinx and when he spoke it was as if the sphinx itself was speaking many new kingdom stelae depict the sphinx wearing a crown if it in fact existed the hole could have been the anchoring point for it mile baraize closed the hole with a metal hatch in howard vyse directed perring in to drill a tunnel in the back of the sphinx just behind the head the boring rods became stuck at a depth of feet m attempts to blast the rods free caused further damage the hole was cleared in among the rubble was a fragment of the sphinx s nemes headdress a major natural fissure in the bedrock cuts through the waist of the sphinx first excavated by auguste mariette in at the top of the back it measures up to metres ft in width baraize in sealed the sides and roofed it with iron bars limestone and cement and installed an iron trap door at the top the sides of the fissure might have been artificially squared however the bottom is irregular bedrock about metre ft above the outside floor a very narrow crack continues deeper in the sphinx was cleared of sand under direction of baraize which revealed an opening to a tunnel at floor level at the north side of the rump it was subsequently closed by masonry veneer and nearly forgotten more than fifty years later the existence of the passage was recalled by three elderly men who had worked during the clearing as basket carriers this led to the rediscovery and excavation of the rump passage in the passage consists of an upper and a lower section which are angled roughly degrees to each other it is possible that the entire passage was cut top down beginning high up on the rump and that the current access point at floor level was made at a later date vyse noted in his diary february and that he was boring near the tail which indicates him as the creator of the passage as no other tunnel has been identified at this location another interpretation is that the shaft is of ancient origin perhaps an exploratory tunnel or an unfinished tomb shaft rump of the sphinx with passage entrance at floor level closeup of the entrance hole of the rump shaft inside the passage looking up seeing entrance stones and upper tunnel looking up the upper tunnel ceiling of upper tunnel looking down the upper part from chamber lower part of rump passage before excavation lower part after excavation a photograph shows a man standing below floor level in a niche in the sphinx s core body it was closed during the restorations another hole might have been at floor level in the large masonry box on the south side of the sphinx the space behind the dream stele between the paws of the sphinx was covered by an iron beam and cement roof which was fitted with an iron trap door at the ledge of the sphinx enclosure a square shaft is located opposite the northern hind paw it was cleared during excavation in by hawass and measures by metres by ft and about metres ft deep lehner interprets the shaft to be an unfinished tomb and named it keyhole shaft because a cuttings in the ledge above the shaft is shaped like the lower part of a keyhole upside down numerous ideas have been suggested to explain or reinterpret the origin and identity of the sphinx that lack sufficient evidential support and or are contradicted by such and are therefore considered part of pseudohistory and pseudoarchaeology until the early th century it was suggested that the face of the sphinx had negroid characteristics as part of now outdated historical race concepts geologist colin reader suggests that water runoff from the giza plateau is responsible for the differential erosion on the walls of the sphinx enclosure because the hydrological characteristics of the area were significantly changed by the quarries he contends this suggests that the sphinx likely predated the quarries and thus the pyramids he points towards the larger cyclopean stones in part of the sphinx temple as well as the causeway alignment with the pyramids and the break in the quarries as evidence that the pyramids took the alignment with some pre existing structure such as the sphinx into consideration when they were constructed and that the sphinx temple was built in two distinct phases he contends that such erosion could have occurred relatively rapidly and suggests that the sphinx was no more than a few centuries older than present archaeology would suggest suggesting an origin from the late pre dynastic or early dynastic era when

 the tower of london officially his majesty s royal palace and fortress of the tower of london is a historic castle on the north bank of the river thames in central london it lies within the london borough of tower hamlets which is separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the city of london by the open space known as tower hill it was founded towards the end of as part of the norman conquest the white tower which gives the entire castle its name was built by william the conqueror in and was a resented symbol of oppression inflicted upon london by the new norman ruling class the castle was also used as a prison from ranulf flambard until kray twins although that was not its primary purpose a grand palace early in its history it served as a royal residence as a whole the tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat there were several phases of expansion mainly under kings richard i henry iii and edward i in the th and th centuries the general layout established by the late th century remains despite later activity on the site the tower of london has played a prominent role in english history it was besieged several times and controlling it has been important to controlling the country the tower has served variously as an armoury a treasury a menagerie the home of the royal mint a public record office and the home of the crown jewels of england from the early th century until the reign of charles ii in the th century a procession would be led from the tower to westminster abbey on the coronation of a monarch in the absence of the monarch the constable of the tower is in charge of the castle this was a powerful and trusted position in the medieval period in the late th century the princes in the tower were housed at the castle when they mysteriously disappeared presumed murdered under the tudors the tower became used less as a royal residence and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery the zenith of the castle s use as a prison was the th and th centuries when many figures who had fallen into disgrace such as elizabeth i before she became queen sir walter raleigh and elizabeth throckmorton were held within its walls this use has led to the phrase sent to the tower despite its enduring reputation as a place of torture and death popularised by th century religious propagandists and th century writers only seven people were executed within the tower before the world wars of the th century executions were more commonly held on the notorious tower hill to the north of the castle with occurring there over a year period in the latter half of the th century institutions such as the royal mint moved out of the castle to other locations leaving many buildings empty anthony salvin and john taylor took the opportunity to restore the tower to what was felt to be its medieval appearance clearing out many of the vacant post medieval structures in the first and second world wars the tower was again used as a prison and witnessed the executions of men for espionage after the second world war damage caused during the blitz was repaired and the castle reopened to the public today the tower of london is one of the country s most popular tourist attractions under the ceremonial charge of the constable of the tower and operated by the resident governor of the tower of london and keeper of the jewel house the property is cared for by the charity historic royal palaces and is protected as a world heritage site the tower was oriented with its strongest and most impressive defences overlooking saxon london which archaeologist alan vince suggests was deliberate it would have visually dominated the surrounding area and stood out to traffic on the river thames the castle is made up of three wards or enclosures the innermost ward contains the white tower and is the earliest phase of the castle encircling it to the north east and west is the inner ward built during the reign of richard i finally there is the outer ward which encompasses the castle and was built under edward i although there were several phases of expansion after william the conqueror founded the tower of london the general layout has remained the same since edward i completed his rebuild in the castle encloses an area of almost acres hectares with a further acres ha around the tower of london constituting the tower liberties land under the direct influence of the castle and cleared for military reasons the precursor of the liberties was laid out in the th century when henry iii ordered that a strip of land adjacent to the castle be kept clear despite popular fiction the tower of london never had a permanent torture chamber although the basement of the white tower housed a rack in later periods tower wharf was built on the bank of the thames under edward i and was expanded to its current size during the reign of richard ii the white tower is a keep also known as a donjon which was often the strongest structure in a medieval castle and contained lodgings suitable for the lord in this case the king or his representative according to military historian allen brown the great tower white tower was also by virtue of its strength majesty and lordly accommodation the donjon par excellence as one of the largest keeps in the christian world the white tower has been described as the most complete eleventh century palace in europe the white tower not including its projecting corner towers measures by metres by ft at the base and is m ft high at the southern battlements the structure was originally three storeys high comprising a basement floor an entrance level and an upper floor the entrance as is usual in norman keeps was above ground in this case on the south face and accessed via a wooden staircase which could be removed in the event of an attack it was probably during henry ii s reign that a forebuilding was added to the south side of the tower to provide extra defences to the entrance but it has not survived each floor was divided into three chambers the largest in the west a smaller room in the north east and the chapel taking up the entrance and upper floors of the south east at the western corners of the building are square towers while to the north east a round tower houses a spiral staircase at the south east corner there is a larger semi circular projection which accommodates the apse of the chapel as the building was intended to be a comfortable residence as well as a stronghold latrines were built into the walls and four fireplaces provided warmth the main building material is kentish rag stone although some local mudstone was also used caen stone was imported from northern france to provide details in the tower s facing although little of the original material survives as it was replaced with portland stone in the th and th centuries reigate stone was also used as ashlar and for carved details its location in the lower courses of the building and at higher levels corresponding to a building break suggest it was readily available and may have been used when access to caen stone was restricted as most of the tower s windows were enlarged in the th century only two original albeit restored examples remain in the south wall at the gallery level the tower was terraced into the side of a mound so the northern side of the basement is partially below ground level as was typical of most keeps the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage one of the rooms contained a well although the layout has remained the same since the tower s construction the interior of the basement dates mostly from the th century when the floor was lowered and the pre existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts the basement is lit through small slits the entrance floor was probably intended for the use of the constable of the tower lieutenant of the tower of london and other important officials the south entrance was blocked during the th century and not reopened until those heading to the upper floor had to pass through a smaller chamber to the east also connected to the entrance floor the crypt of st john s chapel occupied the south east corner and was accessible only from the eastern chamber there is a recess in the north wall of the crypt according to geoffrey parnell keeper of the tower history at the royal armouries the windowless form and restricted access suggest that it was designed as a strong room for safekeeping of royal treasures and important documents the upper floor contained a grand hall in the west and residential chamber in the east both originally open to the roof and surrounded by a gallery built into the wall and st john s chapel in the south east the top floor was added in the th century along with the present roof st john s chapel was not part of the white tower s original design as the apsidal projection was built after the basement walls due to changes in function and design since the tower s construction except for the chapel little is left of the original interior the chapel s current bare and unadorned appearance is reminiscent of how it would have been in the norman period in the th century during henry iii s reign the chapel was decorated with such ornamentation as a gold painted cross and stained glass windows that depicted the virgin mary and the holy trinity the innermost ward encloses an area immediately south of the white tower stretching to what was once the edge of the river thames as was the case at other castles such as the th century hen domen the innermost ward was probably filled with timber buildings from the tower s foundation exactly when the royal lodgings began to encroach from the white tower into the innermost ward is uncertain although it had happened by the s the lodgings were renovated and elaborated during the s and s becoming comparable with other palatial residences such as windsor castle construction of wakefield and lanthorn towers located at the corners of the innermost ward s wall along the river began around nb they probably served as private residences for the queen and king respectively the earliest evidence for how the royal chambers were decorated comes from henry iii s reign the queen s chamber was whitewashed and painted with flowers and imitation stonework a great hall existed in the south of the ward between the two towers it was similar to although slightly smaller than that also built by henry iii at winchester castle near wakefield tower was a postern gate which allowed private access to the king s apartments the innermost ward was originally surrounded by a protective ditch which had been filled in by the s around this time a kitchen was built in the ward between and the innermost ward was transformed and the palace buildings removed the area around the white tower was cleared so that anyone approaching would have to cross open ground the jewel house was demolished and the crown jewels moved to martin tower the inner ward was created during richard the lionheart s reign when a moat was dug to the west of the innermost ward effectively doubling the castle s size henry iii created the ward s east and north walls and the ward s dimensions remain to this day most of henry s work survives and only two of the nine towers he constructed have been completely rebuilt between the wakefield and lanthorn towers the innermost ward s wall also serves as a curtain wall for the inner ward the main entrance to the inner ward would have been through a gatehouse most likely in the west wall on the site of what is now beauchamp tower the inner ward s western curtain wall was rebuilt by edward i the th century beauchamp tower marks the first large scale use of brick as a building material in britain since the th century departure of the romans the beauchamp tower is one of towers that stud the curtain wall clockwise from the south west corner they are bell beauchamp devereux flint bowyer brick martin constable broad arrow salt lanthorn wakefield and the bloody tower while these towers provided positions from which flanking fire could be deployed against a potential enemy they also contained accommodation as its name suggests bell tower housed a belfry its purpose to raise the alarm in the event of an attack the royal bow maker responsible for making longbows crossbows catapults and other siege and hand weapons had a workshop in the bowyer tower a turret at the top of lanthorn tower was used as a beacon by traffic approaching the tower at night as a result of henry s expansion st peter ad vincula a norman chapel which had previously stood outside the tower was incorporated into the castle henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows and stalls for himself and his queen it was rebuilt by edward i at a cost of over and again by henry viii in the current building dates from this period although the chapel was refurbished in the th century immediately west of wakefield tower the bloody tower was built at the same time as the inner ward s curtain wall and as a water gate provided access to the castle from the river thames it was a simple structure protected by a portcullis and gate the bloody tower acquired its name in the th century as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the princes in the tower between and a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between bell and salt towers during the tudor period a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward the castle buildings were remodelled during the stuart period mostly under the auspices of the office of ordnance in just over was spent building a new storehouse now known as the new armouries in the inner ward construction of the grand storehouse north of the white tower began in on the same site as the dilapidated tudor range of storehouses it was destroyed by fire in the waterloo block a former barracks in the castellated gothic revival style with domestic tudor details was built on the site and remains to this day housing the crown jewels on the ground floor a third ward was created during edward i s extension to the tower as the narrow enclosure completely surrounded the castle at the same time a bastion known as legge s mount was built at the castle s northwest corner brass mount the bastion in the northeast corner was a later addition the three rectangular towers along the east wall metres ft apart were dismantled in although the bastions have often been ascribed to the tudor period there is no evidence to support this archaeological investigations suggest that legge s mount dates from the reign of edward i blocked battlements also known as crenellations in the south side of legge s mount are the only surviving medieval battlements at the tower of london the rest are victorian replacements a new metre ft moat was dug beyond the castle s new limits it was originally metres ft deeper in the middle than it is today with the addition of a new curtain wall the old main entrance to the tower of london was obscured and made redundant a new entrance was created in the southwest corner of the external wall circuit the complex consisted of an inner and an outer gatehouse and a barbican which became known as the lion tower as it was associated with the animals as part of the royal menagerie since at least the s the lion tower itself no longer survives edward extended the south side of the tower of london onto land that had previously been submerged by the river thames in this wall he built st thomas s tower between and later known as traitors gate it replaced the bloody tower as the castle s water gate the building is unique in england and the closest parallel is the now demolished water gate at the louvre in paris the dock was covered with arrowslits in case of an attack on the castle from the river there was also a portcullis at the entrance to control who entered there were luxurious lodgings on the first floor edward also moved the royal mint into the tower its exact location early on is unknown although it was probably in either the outer ward or the lion tower by the mint was located in a building in the outer ward near salt tower between and a second water gate cradle tower was added east of st thomas s tower for the king s private use victorious at the battle of hastings on october the invading duke of normandy william the conqueror spent the rest of the year securing his holdings by fortifying key positions he founded several castles along the way but took a circuitous route toward london only when he reached canterbury did he turn towards england s largest city as the fortified bridge into london was held by saxon troops he decided instead to ravage southwark before continuing his journey around southern england a series of norman victories along the route cut the city s supply lines and in december isolated and intimidated its leaders yielded london without a fight between and william established castles although references in the domesday book indicate that many more were founded by his subordinates the normans undertook what has been described as the most extensive and concentrated programme of castle building in the whole history of feudal europe they were multi purpose buildings serving as fortifications used as a base of operations in enemy territory centres of administration and residences william sent an advance party to prepare the city for his entrance to celebrate his victory and found a castle in the words of william s biographer william of poitiers certain fortifications were completed in the city against the restlessness of the huge and brutal populace for he william realised that it was of the first importance to overawe the londoners at the time london was the largest town in england the foundation of westminster abbey and the old palace of westminster under edward the confessor had marked it as a centre of governance and with a prosperous port it was important for the normans to establish control over the settlement the other two castles in london baynard s castle and montfichet s castle were established at the same time the fortification that would later become known as the tower of london was built onto the south east corner of the roman town walls using them as prefabricated defences with the river thames providing additional protection from the south this earliest phase of the castle would have been enclosed by a ditch and defended by a timber palisade and probably had accommodation suitable for william most of the early norman castles were built from timber but by the end of the th century a few including the tower of london had been renovated or replaced with stone work on the white tower which gives the whole castle its name is usually considered to have begun in however the exact date is uncertain william made gundulf bishop of rochester responsible for its construction although it may not have been completed until after william s death in the white tower is the earliest stone keep in england and was the strongest point of the early castle it also contained grand accommodation for the king at the latest it was probably finished by when bishop ranulf flambard was imprisoned there nb flambard was loathed by the english for exacting harsh taxes although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the tower he was also the first person to escape from it using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine he was held in luxury and permitted servants but on february he hosted a banquet for his captors after plying them with drink when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber and out of the tower the escape came as such a surprise that one contemporary chronicler accused the bishop of witchcraft the anglo saxon chronicle records that in king william ii ordered a wall to be built around the tower of london it was probably built from stone and likely replaced the timber palisade that arced around the north and west sides of the castle between the roman wall to the east and the thames to the south the norman conquest of london manifested itself not only with a new ruling class but in the way the city was structured land was confiscated and redistributed amongst the normans who also brought over hundreds of jews for financial reasons the jews arrived under the direct protection of the crown as a result of which jewish communities were often found close to castles the jews used the tower as a retreat when threatened by anti jewish violence the death in of henry i left england with a disputed succession although the king had persuaded his most powerful barons to swear support for the empress matilda just a few days after henry s death stephen of blois arrived from france to lay claim to the throne the importance of the city and its tower is marked by the speed at which he secured london the castle which had not been used as a royal residence for some time was usually left in the charge of a constable a post held at this time by geoffrey de mandeville as the tower was considered an impregnable fortress in a strategically important position possession was highly valued mandeville exploited this selling his allegiance to matilda after stephen was captured in at the battle of lincoln once her support waned the following year he resold his loyalty to stephen through his role as constable of the tower mandeville became the richest and most powerful man in england when he tried the same ploy again this time holding secret talks with matilda stephen had him arrested forced him to cede control of his castles and replaced him with one of his most loyal supporters until then the position had been hereditary originally held by geoffrey de mandeville but the position s authority was such that from then on it remained in the hands of an appointee of the monarch the position was usually given to someone of great importance who might not always be at the castle due to other duties although the constable was still responsible for maintaining the castle and its garrison from an early stage he had a subordinate to help with this duty the lieutenant of the tower constables also had civic duties relating to the city usually they were given control of the city and were responsible for levying taxes enforcing the law and maintaining order the creation in of the position of lord mayor of london removed many of the constable s civic powers and at times led to friction between the two the castle probably retained its form as established by until the reign of richard i the castle was extended under william longchamp king richard s lord chancellor and the man in charge of england while he was on crusade the pipe rolls record s d spent at the tower of london between december and november from an estimated spent by richard on castle building in england according to the contemporary chronicler roger of howden longchamp dug a moat around the castle and tried in vain to fill it from the thames longchamp was also constable of the tower and undertook its expansion while preparing for war with king richard s younger brother prince john who in richard s absence arrived in england to try to seize power as longchamp s main fortress he made the tower as strong as possible the new fortifications were first tested in october when the tower was besieged for the first time in its history longchamp capitulated to john after just three days deciding he had more to gain from surrender than prolonging the siege john succeeded richard as king in but his rule proved unpopular with many of his barons who in response moved against him in while the king was at windsor castle robert fitzwalter led an army into london and laid siege to the tower although under garrisoned the tower resisted and the siege was lifted once john signed the magna carta the king reneged on his promises of reform leading to the outbreak of the first barons war even after the magna carta was signed fitzwalter maintained his control of london during the war the tower s garrison joined forces with the barons john was deposed in and the barons offered the english throne to prince louis the eldest son of the french king however after john s death in october many began to support the claim of his eldest son henry iii war continued between the factions supporting louis and henry with fitzwalter supporting louis fitzwalter was still in control of london and the tower both of which held out until it was clear that henry iii s supporters would prevail in the th century kings henry iii and edward i extended the castle essentially creating it as it stands today henry was disconnected from his barons and a mutual lack of understanding led to unrest and resentment towards his rule as a result he was eager to ensure the tower of london was a formidable fortification at the same time henry was an aesthete and wished to make the castle a comfortable place to live from to nearly was spent on the tower of london in this period only the work at windsor castle cost more most of the work was focused on the palatial buildings of the innermost ward the tradition of whitewashing the white tower from which it derives its name began in beginning around the castle was expanded to the east north and north west the work lasted through the reign of henry iii and into that of edward i interrupted occasionally by civil unrest new creations included a new defensive perimeter studded with towers while on the west north and east sides where the wall was not defended by the river a defensive ditch was dug the eastern extension took the castle beyond the bounds of the old roman settlement marked by the city wall which had been incorporated into the castle s defences the tower had long been a symbol of oppression despised by londoners and henry s building programme was unpopular so when the gatehouse collapsed in the locals celebrated the setback the expansion caused disruption locally and was paid to st katherine s hospital and the prior of holy trinity in compensation henry iii often held court at the tower of london and held parliament there on at least two occasions and when he felt that the barons were becoming dangerously unruly in the discontented barons led by simon de montfort forced the king to agree to reforms including the holding of regular parliaments relinquishing the tower of london was among the conditions henry iii resented losing power and sought permission from the pope to break his oath with the backing of mercenaries henry installed himself in the tower in while negotiations continued with the barons the king ensconced himself in the castle although no army moved to take it a truce was agreed with the condition that the king hand over control of the tower once again henry won a significant victory at the battle of evesham in allowing him to regain control of the country and the tower of london cardinal ottobuon came to england to excommunicate those who were still rebellious the act was deeply unpopular and the situation was exacerbated when the cardinal was granted custody of the tower gilbert de clare th earl of hertford marched on london in april and laid siege to the castle declaring that custody of the tower was not a post to be trusted in the hands of a foreigner much less of an ecclesiastic despite a large army and siege engines gilbert de clare was unable to take the castle the earl retreated allowing the king control of the capital and the tower experienced peace for the rest of henry s reign although he was rarely in london edward i undertook an expensive remodelling of the tower costing between and over double that spent on the castle during the whole of henry iii s reign edward i was a seasoned castle builder and used his experience of siege warfare during the crusades to bring innovations to castle building his programme of castle building in wales heralded the introduction of the widespread use of arrowslits in castle walls across europe drawing on eastern influences at the tower of london edward filled in the moat dug by henry iii and built a new curtain wall along its line creating a new enclosure a new moat was created in front of the new curtain wall the western part of henry iii s curtain wall was rebuilt with beauchamp tower replacing the castle s old gatehouse a new entrance was created with elaborate defences including two gatehouses and a barbican in an effort to make the castle self sufficient edward i also added two watermills six hundred jews were imprisoned in the tower of london in charged with coin clipping persecution of the country s jewish population under edward began in and culminated in when he issued the edict of expulsion forcing the jews out of the country in the country s numerous mints were unified under a single system whereby control was centralised to the mint within the tower of london while mints outside of london were reduced with only a few local and episcopal mints continuing to operate during edward ii s reign there was relatively little activity at the tower of london however it was during this period that the privy wardrobe was founded the institution was based at the tower and responsible for organising the state s arms in margaret de clare baroness badlesmere became the first woman imprisoned in the tower of london after she refused queen isabella admittance to leeds castle and ordered her archers to fire upon isabella killing six of the royal escort generally reserved for high ranking inmates the tower was the most important royal prison in the country however it was not necessarily very secure and throughout its history people bribed the guards to help them escape in roger mortimer baron mortimer was aided in his escape from the tower by the sub lieutenant of the tower who let mortimer s men inside they hacked a hole in his cell wall and mortimer escaped to a waiting boat he fled to france where he encountered edward s queen they began an affair and plotted to overthrow the king one of mortimer s first acts on entering england in was to capture the tower and release the prisoners held there for four years he ruled while edward iii was too young to do so himself in edward and his supporters captured mortimer and threw him into the tower under edward iii s rule england experienced renewed success in warfare after his father s reign had put the realm on the backfoot against the scots and french amongst edward s successes were the battles of cr cy and poitiers where king john ii of france was taken prisoner and the capture of the king david ii of scotland at neville s cross during this period the tower of london held many noble prisoners of war edward ii had allowed the tower of london to fall into a state of disrepair and by the reign of edward iii the castle was an uncomfortable place the nobility held captive within its walls were unable to engage in activities such as hunting which were permissible at other royal castles used as prisons for instance windsor edward iii ordered that the castle should be renovated when richard ii was crowned in he led a procession from the tower to westminster abbey this tradition began in at least the early th century and lasted until during the peasants revolt of the tower of london was besieged with the king inside when richard rode out to meet with wat tyler the rebel leader a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the jewel house the archbishop of canterbury simon sudbury took refuge in st john s chapel hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary however he was taken away and beheaded on tower hill six years later there was again civil unrest and richard spent christmas in the security of the tower rather than windsor as was more usual when henry bolingbroke returned from exile in richard was imprisoned in the white tower he abdicated and was replaced on the throne by bolingbroke who became king henry iv in the th century there was little building work at the tower of london yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge when supporters of the late richard ii attempted a coup henry iv found safety in the tower of london during this period the castle also held many distinguished prisoners the heir to the scottish throne later king james i of scotland was kidnapped while journeying to france in and held in the tower the reign of henry v renewed england s fortune in the hundred years war against france as a result of henry s victories such as the battle of agincourt many high status prisoners were held in the tower of london until they were ransomed much of the latter half of the th century was occupied by the wars of the roses between the claimants to the throne the houses of lancaster and york the castle was once again besieged in this time by a yorkist force the tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when henry vi was captured at the battle of northampton with the help of richard neville th earl of warwick nicknamed the kingmaker henry recaptured the throne for a short time in however edward iv soon regained control and henry vi was imprisoned in the tower of london where he was probably murdered in during the siege of london the tower s yorkist garrison exchanged fire with lancastrians holding southwark and sallied from the fortress to take part in a pincer movement to attack lancastrians who were assaulting aldgate on london s defensive wall during the wars the tower was fortified to withstand gunfire and provided with loopholes for cannons and handguns an enclosure called the bulwark was created for this purpose to the south of tower hill although it no longer survives shortly after the death of edward iv in the notorious murder of the princes in the tower is traditionally believed to have taken place the incident is one of the most infamous events associated with the tower of london edward v s uncle richard duke of gloucester was declared lord protector while the prince was too young to rule traditional accounts have held that the year old edward was confined to the tower of london along with his younger brother richard the duke of gloucester was proclaimed king richard iii in june the princes were last seen in public in june it has traditionally been thought that the most likely reason for their disappearance is that they were murdered late in the summer of bones thought to belong to them were discovered in when the th century forebuilding at the entrance to the white tower was demolished however the reputed level at which the bones were found ft or m would put the bones at a depth similar to that of the roman graveyard found in ft m underneath the minories a few hundred yards to the north opposition to richard escalated until he was defeated at the battle of bosworth field in by the lancastrian henry tudor who ascended to the throne as henry vii as king henry vii built a tower for a library next to the king s tower the beginning of the tudor period marked the start of the decline of the tower of london s use as a royal residence as th century chronicler raphael holinshed said the tower became used more as an armouries and house of munition and thereunto a place for the safekeeping of offenders than a palace roiall for a king or queen to sojourne in henry vii visited the tower on fourteen occasions between and usually staying for less than a week at a time the yeoman warders have been the royal bodyguard since at least in the tower fired its cannon at city crowds engaged in the xenophobic evil may day riots in which the properties of foreign residents were ransacked it is not thought that any rioters were hurt by the gunfire which was probably meant to merely intimidate the mob during the reign of henry viii the tower was assessed as needing considerable work on its defences in thomas cromwell spent on repairs and imported nearly tons of caen stone for the work even so this was not sufficient to bring the castle up to the standard of contemporary military fortifications which were designed to withstand powerful artillery although the defences were repaired the palace buildings were left in a state of neglect after henry s death their condition was so poor that they were virtually uninhabitable from onwards the tower of london was only used as a royal residence when its political and historic symbolism was considered useful for instance each of edward vi mary i and elizabeth i briefly stayed at the tower before their coronations in the th century the tower acquired an enduring reputation as a grim forbidding prison this had not always been the case as a royal castle it was used by the monarch to imprison people for various reasons however these were usually high status individuals for short periods rather than common citizenry as there were plenty of prisons elsewhere for such people contrary to the popular image of the tower prisoners were able to make their life easier by purchasing amenities such as better food or tapestries through the lieutenant of the tower as holding prisoners was originally an incidental role of the tower as would have been the case for any castle there was no purpose built accommodation for prisoners until when a brick shed a prison for soldiers was built to the north west of the white tower the tower s reputation for torture and imprisonment derives largely from th century religious propagandists and th century romanticists although much of the tower s reputation is exaggerated the th and th centuries marked the castle s zenith as a prison with many religious and political undesirables locked away the privy council had to sanction the use of torture so it was not often used between and the peak of imprisonment at the tower there were recorded cases of the use of torture the three most common forms used were the infamous rack the scavenger s daughter and manacles the rack was introduced to england in by the duke of exeter the constable of the tower consequentially it was also known as the duke of exeter s daughter one of those tortured at the tower was guy fawkes who was brought there on november after torture he signed a full confession to the gunpowder plot among those held and executed at the tower was anne boleyn although the yeoman warders were once the royal bodyguard by the th and th centuries their main duty had become to look after the prisoners the tower was often a safer place than other prisons in london such as the fleet where disease was rife high status prisoners could live in conditions comparable to those they might expect outside one such example was that while walter raleigh was held in the tower his rooms were altered to accommodate his family including his son who was born there in executions were usually carried out on tower hill rather than in the tower of london itself and people were executed on the hill over years before the th century there had been seven executions within the castle on tower green as was the case with lady jane grey this was reserved for prisoners for whom public execution was considered dangerous after lady jane grey s execution on february queen mary i imprisoned her sister elizabeth later queen elizabeth i in the tower under suspicion of causing rebellion as sir thomas wyatt had led a revolt against mary in elizabeth s name the office of ordnance and armoury office were founded in the th century taking over the privy wardrobe s duties of looking after the monarch s arsenal and valuables as there was no standing army before the importance of the royal armoury at the tower of london was that it provided a professional basis for procuring supplies and equipment in times of war the two bodies were resident at the tower from at least and by the th century they had moved to a position in the inner ward the board of ordnance successor to these offices had its headquarters in the white tower and used surrounding buildings for storage in the board was abolished its successor the military store department of the war office was also based there until after which its headquarters staff were relocated to the royal arsenal in woolwich where the recently closed woolwich dockyard was converted into a vast ordnance store political tensions between charles i and parliament in the second quarter of the th century led to an attempt by forces loyal to the king to secure the tower and its valuable contents including money and munitions london s trained bands a militia force were moved into the castle in plans for defence were drawn up and gun platforms were built readying the tower for war the preparations were never put to the test in charles i attempted to arrest five members of parliament when this failed he fled the city and parliament retaliated by removing sir john byron the lieutenant of the tower the trained bands had switched sides and now supported parliament together with the london citizenry they blockaded the tower with permission from the king byron relinquished control of the tower parliament replaced byron with a man of their own choosing sir john conyers by the time the english civil war broke out in november the tower of london was already in parliament s control the last monarch to uphold the tradition of taking a procession from the tower to westminster to be crowned was charles ii in at the time the castle s accommodation was in such poor condition that he did not stay there the night before his coronation under the stuart kings the tower s buildings were remodelled mostly under the auspices of the office of ordnance just over was spent in on building a new storehouse now known as the new armouries in the inner ward in the th century there were plans to enhance the tower s defences in the style of the trace italienne however they were never acted on although the facilities for the garrison were improved with the addition of the first purpose built quarters for soldiers the irish barracks in the general accommodations were still in poor condition when the hanoverian dynasty ascended the throne their situation was uncertain and with a possible scottish rebellion in mind the tower of london was repaired most of the work in this period to was done by the king s master mason john deval gun platforms added under the stuarts had decayed the number of guns at the tower was reduced from to and one contemporary commentator noted that the castle would not hold out four and twenty hours against an army prepared for a siege for the most part the th century work on the defences was spasmodic and piecemeal although a new gateway in the southern curtain wall permitting access from the wharf to the outer ward was added in the moat surrounding the castle had become silted over the centuries since it was created despite attempts at clearing it it was still an integral part of the castle s defences so in the constable of the tower the duke of wellington ordered a large scale clearance of several feet of silt however this did not prevent an outbreak of disease in the garrison in caused by poor water supply resulting in several deaths to prevent the festering ditch posing further health problems it was ordered that the moat should be drained and filled with earth the work began in and was mostly complete two years later the construction of the waterloo barracks in the inner ward began in when the duke of wellington laid the foundation stone the building could accommodate men at the same time separate quarters for the officers were built to the north east of the white tower the building is now the headquarters of the royal regiment of fusiliers the popularity of the chartist movement between and led to a desire to refortify the tower of london in the event of civil unrest it was the last major programme of fortification at the castle most of the surviving installations for the use of artillery and firearms date from this period during the first world war eleven men were tried in private and shot by firing squad at the tower for espionage during the second world war the tower was once again used to hold prisoners of war one such person was rudolf hess adolf hitler s deputy albeit just for four days in he was the last state prisoner to be held at the castle the last person to be executed at the tower was german spy josef jakobs who was shot on august the executions for espionage during the wars took place in a prefabricated miniature rifle range which stood in the outer ward and was demolished in the second world war also saw the last use of the tower as a fortification in the event of a german invasion the tower together with the royal mint and nearby warehouses was to have formed one of three keeps or complexes of defended buildings which formed the last ditch defences of the capital the tower of london has become established as one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country it has been a tourist attraction since at least the elizabethan period when it was one of the sights of london that foreign visitors wrote about its most popular attractions were the royal menagerie and displays of armour the crown jewels also garner much interest and have been on public display since the tower steadily gained popularity with tourists through the th century despite the opposition of the duke of wellington to visitors numbers became so high that by a purpose built ticket office was erected by the end of the century over were visiting the castle every year over the th and th centuries the palatial buildings were slowly adapted for other uses and demolished only the wakefield and st thomas s towers survived the th century marked an increasing interest in england s medieval past one of the effects was the emergence of gothic revival architecture in the tower s architecture this was manifest when the new horse armoury was built in against the south face of the white tower it featured elements of gothic revival architecture such as battlements other buildings were remodelled to match the style and the waterloo barracks were described as castellated gothic of the th century between and institutions such as the mint which had inhabited the castle for centuries moved to other sites many of the post medieval structures left vacant were demolished in the war office took over responsibility for manufacture and storage of weapons from the ordnance office which was gradually phased out of the castle at the same time there was greater interest in the history of the tower of london public interest was partly fuelled by contemporary writers of whom the work of william harrison ainsworth was particularly influential in the tower of london a historical romance he created a vivid image of underground torture chambers and devices for extracting confessions that stuck in the public imagination ainsworth also played another role in the tower s history as he suggested that beauchamp tower should be opened to the public so they could see the inscriptions of th and th century prisoners working on the suggestion anthony salvin refurbished the tower and led a further programme for a comprehensive restoration at the behest of prince albert salvin was succeeded in the work by john taylor when a feature did not meet his expectations of medieval architecture taylor would ruthlessly remove it as a result several important buildings within the castle were pulled down and in some cases post medieval internal decoration removed although only one bomb fell on the tower of london in the first world war it landed harmlessly in the moat the second world war left a greater mark on september during the blitz high explosive bombs damaged the castle destroying several buildings and narrowly missing the white tower after the war the damage was repaired and the tower of london was reopened to the public a bombing in the white tower mortar room left one person dead and injured no one claimed responsibility for the blast but the police investigated suspicions that the ira was behind it in the st century tourism is the tower s primary role with the remaining routine military activities under the royal logistic corps having wound down in the latter half of the th century and moved out of the castle however the tower is still home to the regimental headquarters of the royal regiment of fusiliers and the museum dedicated to it and its predecessor the royal fusiliers also a detachment of the unit providing the king s guard at buckingham palace still mounts a guard at the tower and with the yeomen warders takes part in the ceremony of the keys each day on several occasions through the year gun salutes are fired from the tower by the honourable artillery company these consist of rounds for royal occasions and on other occasions since the tower of london has been cared for by an independent charity historic royal palaces which receives no funding from the government or the crown in the tower of london was added to the unesco list of world heritage sites in recognition of its global importance and to help conserve and protect the site however recent developments such as the construction of skyscrapers nearby have pushed the tower towards being added to the united nations heritage in danger list the remains of the medieval palace have been open to the public since where visitors can explore the restored chambers although the position of constable of the tower remains the highest position held at the tower the responsibility of day to day administration is delegated to the resident governor the constable is appointed for a five year term this is primarily a ceremonial post today but the constable is also a trustee of historic royal palaces and of the royal armouries general sir gordon messenger was appointed constable in at least six ravens are kept at the tower at all times in accordance with the belief that if they are absent the kingdom will fall they are under the care of the ravenmaster one of the yeoman warders as well as having ceremonial duties the yeoman warders provide guided tours around the tower the yeomen warders provided the permanent garrison of the tower but the constable of the tower could call upon the men of the tower hamlets to supplement them when necessary the tower hamlets aka tower division of middlesex s ossulstone hundred was an area significantly larger than the modern london borough of the same name which owed military service to the constable in his ex officio role as lord lieutenant of the tower hamlets the earliest surviving reference to the inhabitants of the tower hamlets having a duty to provide a guard for the tower of london is from during the reign of mary i but the relationship is thought to go back much further some believe the connection goes back to the time of the conqueror the duty is likely to have had its origin in the rights and obligations of the manor of stepney which covered most or all of the hamlets area the tradition of housing the crown jewels in the tower of london probably dates from the reign of henry iii the jewel house was built specifically to house the royal regalia including jewels plate and symbols of royalty such as the crown sceptre and sword when money needed to be raised the treasure could be pawned by the monarch the treasure allowed the monarch independence from the aristocracy and consequently was closely guarded a new position for keeper of the jewels armouries and other things was created which was well rewarded in the reign of edward iii the holder was paid d a day the position grew to include other duties including purchasing royal jewels gold and silver and appointing royal goldsmiths and jewellers in during the english commonwealth following charles i s execution the contents of the jewel house were disposed of along with other royal properties as decreed by cromwell metal items were sent to the mint to be melted down and re used and the crowns were totallie broken and defaced when the monarchy was restored in the only surviving items of the coronation regalia were a th century spoon and three ceremonial swords some pieces that had been sold were later returned to the crown detailed records of old regalia survived and replacements were made for the coronation of charles ii in based on drawings from the time of charles i for the coronation of charles ii gems were rented because the treasury could not afford to replace them in the jewel house was demolished and the crown jewels moved into martin tower until they were displayed here for viewing by the paying public this was exploited two years later when colonel thomas blood attempted to steal them blood and his accomplices bound and gagged the jewel house keeper although they laid their hands on the imperial state crown sceptre and orb they were foiled when the keeper s son turned up unexpectedly and raised the alarm since the crown jewels have been on display in the jewel house in the waterloo block some of the pieces were once regularly used by queen elizabeth ii the display includes gemstones the year old coronation spoon st edward s crown traditionally placed on a monarch s head at the moment of crowning and the imperial state crown there is evidence that king john first started keeping wild animals at the tower records of show payments to lion keepers the royal menagerie is frequently referenced during the reign of henry iii holy roman emperor frederick ii presented henry with three leopards circa which were kept in the tower in the sheriffs were ordered to pay fourpence a day towards the upkeep of the king s polar bear a gift from haakon iv of norway in the same year the bear attracted a great deal of attention from londoners when it went fishing in the thames while tied to the land by a chain in or henry iii received an african elephant from louis ix of france depicted by matthew paris in his chronica majora a wooden structure was built to house the elephant m ft long by m ft wide the animal died in possibly because it was given red wine but also perhaps because of the cold climate of england in edward i added a lion and a lynx and appointed the first official keeper of the animals edward iii added other types of animals two lions a leopard and two wildcats under subsequent kings the number of animals grew to include additional cats of various types jackals hyenas and an old brown bear max gifted to henry viii by emperor maximilian in during the time of henry vi all the lions died and the employment of keeper william kerby was terminated historical records indicate that a semi circular structure or barbican was built by edward i in this area was later named the lion tower to the immediate west of the middle tower records from indicate the purchase of a lock and key for the lions and leopards also suggesting they were located near the western entrance of the tower by the s that area was called the menagerie between and the menagerie was extensively refurbished and an exercise yard was created in the moat area beside the lion tower an overhead platform was added for viewing of the lions by the royals during lion baiting for example in the time of james i reports from include mention of six lions increasing to by in addition to other types of cats eagles owls and a jackal by the th century the menagerie was open to the public admission cost three half pence or a cat or dog to be fed to the lions by the end of the century that had increased to pence a particularly famous inhabitant was old martin a large grizzly bear given to george iii by the hudson s bay company in an inventory also listed a tiger leopards a hyena a large baboon various types of monkeys wolves and other animals by however the collection included only a grizzly bear an elephant and some birds additional animals were then introduced in there were over representing at least species as the new keeper alfred copps was actively acquiring animals after the death of george iv in a decision was made to close down the menagerie on the orders of the duke of wellington in most of the stock was moved to the london zoo which had opened in this decision was made after an incident although sources vary as to the specifics either a lion was accused of biting a soldier or a sailor ensign seymour had been bitten by a monkey the last of the animals left in relocated to regent s park the menagerie buildings were removed in but the keeper of the royal menagerie was entitled to use the lion tower as a house for life consequently even though the animals had long since left the building the tower was not demolished until the death of copps the last keeper in in physical evidence of lion cages was found one being x metres x feet in size very small for a lion that can grow to be meters approximately feet long in the skulls of two male barbary lions now extinct in the wild from northwest africa were found in the moat area of the tower radiocarbon tests dated them from to and in an exhibition was hosted at the tower with fine wire sculptures by kendra haste the tower of london has been represented in popular culture in many ways as a result of th and th century writers the tower has a reputation as a grim fortress a place of torture and execution one of the earliest traditions associated with the tower was that it was built by julius caesar the story was popular amongst writers and antiquaries the earliest recorded attribution of the tower to the roman ruler dates to the mid th century in a poem by sir thomas gray the origin of the myth is uncertain although it may be related to the fact that the tower was built in the corner of london s roman walls another possibility is that someone misread a passage from gervase of tilbury in which he says caesar built a tower at odnea in france gervase wrote odnea as dodres which is close to the french for london londres today the story survives in william shakespeare s richard ii and richard iii and as late as the th century some still regarded the tower as built by caesar anne boleyn was beheaded in for treason against henry viii her ghost supposedly haunts the church of st peter ad vincula in the tower where she is buried and has been said to walk around the white tower carrying her head under her arm this haunting is commemorated in the comic song with her head tucked underneath her arm other reported ghosts include henry vi lady jane grey margaret pole and the princes in the tower in january a sentry on guard outside the jewel house claimed to have witnessed an apparition of a bear advancing towards him and reportedly died of fright a few days later in october a tubular glowing apparition was claimed to have been seen in the jewel house by the keeper of the crown jewels edmund lenthal swifte he said that the apparition hovered over the shoulder of his wife leading her to exclaim oh christ it has seized me other

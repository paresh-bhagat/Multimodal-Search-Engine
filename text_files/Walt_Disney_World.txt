travels and camp david on april florida governor ron desantis signed a bill into law which would officially strip the walt disney company of its longtime self governing status in the area around walt

gay bill by critics in walt disney productions began looking for land to house a second resort to supplement disneyland in anaheim california which had opened in market surveys at the time revealed that only of disneyland s visitors came from east of the mississippi river where of the population of the united states lived additionally walt disney disliked the businesses that had sprung up around disneyland and wanted more control over a larger area of land in the next project walt disney took a flight over a potential site in orlando florida one of many in november after witnessing the well developed network of roads and taking the planned construction of both interstate and florida s turnpike into account with mccoy air force base later orlando international airport to the east disney selected a centrally located site near bay lake the development was referred to in house as the florida project to avoid a burst of land speculation walt disney productions used various dummy corporations to acquire acres sq mi km of land in may some of these major land transactions were recorded a few miles southwest of orlando in osceola county in addition two large tracts totaling million were sold and smaller tracts of flatlands and cattle pastures were purchased by exotically named companies such as the ayefour corporation latin american development and management corporation and the reedy creek ranch corporation some are now memorialized on a window above main street u s a in the magic kingdom the smaller parcels of land acquired were called outs they were five acre ha lots platted in by the munger land company and sold to investors most of the owners in the s were happy to get rid of the land which was mostly swamp at the time another issue was the mineral rights to the land which were owned by tufts university without the transfer of these rights tufts could come in at any time and demand the removal of buildings to obtain minerals eventually disney s team negotiated a deal with tufts to buy the mineral rights for working strictly in secrecy real estate agents unaware of their client s identity began making offers to landowners in april in parts of southwest orange and northwest osceola counties the agents were careful not to reveal the extent of their intentions and they were able to negotiate numerous land contracts with some landowners including large tracts of land for as little as an acre with the understanding that the recording of the first deeds would trigger intense public scrutiny disney delayed the filing of paperwork until a large portion of the land was under contract early rumors and speculation about the land purchases assumed possible development by nasa in support of the nearby kennedy space center as well as references to other famous investors such as ford the rockefellers and howard hughes an orlando sentinel news article published weeks later on may acknowledged a popular rumor that disney was building an east coast version of disneyland however the publication denied its accuracy based on an earlier interview with disney at kennedy space center in which he claimed a million investment was in the works for disneyland and that he had no interest in building a new park in october editor emily bavar from the sentinel visited disneyland during the park s th anniversary celebration in an interview with disney she asked him if he was behind recent land purchases in central florida bavar later described that disney looked like i had thrown a bucket of water in his face before denying the story his reaction combined with other research obtained during her anaheim visit led bavar to author a story on october where she predicted that disney was building a second theme park in florida three days later after gathering more information from various sources the sentinel published another article headlined we say mystery industry is disney walt disney had originally planned to publicly reveal disney world on november but in light of the sentinel story disney asked florida governor haydon burns to confirm the story on october his announcement called the new theme park the greatest attraction in the history of florida the official reveal was kept on the previously planned november date and disney joined burns in orlando for the event walt disney died from circulatory collapse caused by smoking related lung cancer on december before his vision was realized his brother and business partner roy o disney postponed his retirement to oversee construction of the resort s first phase on february roy o disney held a press conference at the park theatres in winter park florida the role of epcot was emphasized in the film that was played after the film it was explained that for disney world including epcot to succeed a special district would have to be formed the reedy creek improvement district with two cities inside it bay lake and reedy creek now lake buena vista in addition to the standard powers of an incorporated city which include issuance of tax free bonds the district would have immunity from any current or future county or state land use laws the only areas where the district had to submit to the county and state would be property taxes and elevator inspections the legislation forming the district and the two cities one of which was the reedy creek improvement act was signed into law by florida governor claude r kirk jr on may the supreme court of florida then ruled in that the district was allowed to issue tax exempt bonds for public projects within the district despite the sole beneficiary being walt disney productions the district soon began construction of drainage canals and disney built the first roads and the magic kingdom the contemporary resort hotel and the polynesian village resort were also completed in time for the park s opening on october the palm and magnolia golf courses near the magic kingdom had opened a few weeks before while fort wilderness opened one month later twenty four days after the park opened roy o disney dedicated the property and declared that it would be known as walt disney world in his brother s honor in his own words everyone has heard of ford cars but have they all heard of henry ford who started it all walt disney world is in memory of the man who started it all so people will know his name as long as walt disney world is here after the dedication roy disney asked walt s widow lillian what she thought of walt disney world according to biographer bob thomas she responded i think walt would have approved roy disney died at age on december less than three months after the property opened admission prices in were for adults for juniors under age and one dollar for children under twelve much of walt disney s plans for his progress city concept were abandoned after his death and after the company board decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city the concept evolved into the resort s second theme park epcot center which opened in renamed epcot in while still emulating walt disney s original idea of showcasing new technology the park is closer to a world s fair than a community of tomorrow one of epcot s main attractions is the world showcase which highlights countries across the globe some of the urban planning concepts from the original idea of epcot would instead be integrated into the community of celebration florida much later the resort s third theme park disney mgm studios renamed disney s hollywood studios in opened in and is

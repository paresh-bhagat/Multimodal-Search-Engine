 the brooklyn bridge is a hybrid cable stayed suspension bridge in new york city spanning the east river between the boroughs of manhattan and brooklyn opened on may the brooklyn bridge was the first fixed crossing of the east river it was also the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time of its opening with a main span of feet m and a deck ft m above mean high water the span was originally called the new york and brooklyn bridge or the east river bridge but was officially renamed the brooklyn bridge in proposals for a bridge connecting manhattan and brooklyn were first made in the early th century which eventually led to the construction of the current span designed by john a roebling the project s chief engineer his son washington roebling contributed further design work assisted by the latter s wife emily warren roebling construction started in with the tammany hall controlled new york bridge company overseeing construction although numerous controversies and the novelty of the design prolonged the project over thirteen years since opening the brooklyn bridge has undergone several reconfigurations having carried horse drawn vehicles and elevated railway lines until to alleviate increasing traffic flows additional bridges and tunnels were built across the east river following gradual deterioration the brooklyn bridge has been renovated several times including in the s s and s the brooklyn bridge is the southernmost of the four toll free vehicular bridges connecting manhattan island and long island with the manhattan bridge the williamsburg bridge and the queensboro bridge to the north only passenger vehicles and pedestrian and bicycle traffic are permitted a major tourist attraction since its opening the brooklyn bridge has become an icon of new york city over the years the bridge has been used as the location of various stunts and performances as well as several crimes and attacks the brooklyn bridge has been designated a national historic landmark a new york city landmark and a national historic civil engineering landmark the brooklyn bridge an early example of a steel wire suspension bridge b uses a hybrid cable stayed suspension bridge design with both vertical and diagonal suspender cables its stone towers are neo gothic with characteristic pointed arches the new york city department of transportation nycdot which maintains the bridge says that its original paint scheme was brooklyn bridge tan and silver although a writer for the new york post states that it was originally entirely rawlins red to provide sufficient clearance for shipping in the east river the brooklyn bridge incorporates long approach viaducts on either end to raise it from low ground on both shores including approaches the brooklyn bridge is a total of feet m long when measured between the curbs at park row in manhattan and sands street in brooklyn a separate measurement of feet m is sometimes given this is the distance from the curb at centre street in manhattan the main span between the two suspension towers is feet m long and feet m wide the bridge elongates and contracts between the extremes of temperature from to inches navigational clearance is ft m above mean high water mhw a engineering magazine article said that at the center of the span the height above mhw could fluctuate by more than feet m due to temperature and traffic loads while more rigid spans had a lower maximum deflection the side spans between each suspension tower and each side s suspension anchorages are feet m long at the time of construction engineers had not yet discovered the aerodynamics of bridge construction and bridge designs were not tested in wind tunnels it was coincidental that the open truss structure supporting the deck is by its nature subject to fewer aerodynamic problems this is because john roebling designed the brooklyn bridge s truss system to be six to eight times as strong as he thought it needed to be however due to a supplier s fraudulent substitution of inferior quality cable in the initial construction the bridge was reappraised at the time as being only four times as strong as necessary the main span and side spans are supported by a structure containing six trusses running parallel to the roadway each of which is feet m deep the trusses allow the brooklyn bridge to hold a total load of short tons long tons a design consideration from when it originally carried heavier elevated trains these trusses are held up by suspender ropes which hang downward from each of the four main cables crossbeams run between the trusses at the top and diagonal and vertical stiffening beams run on the outside and inside of each roadway an elevated pedestrian only promenade runs in between the two roadways and feet m above them it typically runs feet m below the level of the crossbeams except at the areas surrounding each tower here the promenade rises to just above the level of the crossbeams connecting to a balcony that slightly overhangs the two roadways the path is generally to feet to m wide the iron railings were produced by janes kirtland a bronx iron foundry that also made the united states capitol dome and the bow bridge in central park each of the side spans is reached by an approach ramp the foot m approach ramp from the brooklyn side is shorter than the foot m approach ramp from the manhattan side the approaches are supported by renaissance style arches made of masonry the arch openings themselves were filled with brick walls with small windows within the approach ramp contains nine arch or iron girder bridges across side streets in manhattan and brooklyn underneath the manhattan approach a series of brick slopes or banks was developed into a skate park the brooklyn banks in the late s the park uses the approach s support pillars as obstacles in the mid s the brooklyn banks were closed to the public because the area was being used as a storage site during the bridge s renovation the skateboarding community has attempted to save the banks on multiple occasions after the city destroyed the smaller banks in the s the city government agreed to keep the larger banks for skateboarding when the nycdot removed the bricks from the banks in skateboarders started an online petition the brooklyn bridge contains four main cables which descend from the tops of the suspension towers and help support the deck two are located to the outside of the bridge s roadways while two are in the median of the roadways each main cable measures inches cm in diameter and contains parallel galvanized steel wires wrapped closely together in a cylindrical shape these wires are bundled in individual strands with wires to a strand this was the first use of bundling in a suspension bridge and took several months for workers to tie together since the s the main cables have also supported a series of watt led lighting fixtures referred to as necklace lights due to their shape in addition galvanized steel wire suspender cables hang downward from the main cables and another cable stays extend diagonally from the towers these wires hold up the truss structure around the bridge deck each side of the bridge contains an anchorage for the main cables the anchorages are trapezoidal limestone structures located slightly inland of the shore measuring by feet by m at the base and by feet by m at the top each anchorage weighs short tons long tons t the manhattan anchorage rests on a foundation of bedrock while the brooklyn anchorage rests on clay the anchorages both have four anchor plates one for each of the main cables which are located near ground level and parallel to the ground the anchor plates measure by feet by m with a thickness of feet m and weigh pounds kg each each anchor plate is connected to the respective main cable by two sets of nine eyebars each of which is about feet m long and up to by inches by mm thick the chains of eyebars curve downward from the cables toward the anchor plates and the eyebars vary in size depending on their position c the anchorages also contain numerous passageways and compartments starting in in order to fund the bridge s maintenance the new york city government made the large vaults under the bridge s manhattan anchorage available for rent and they were in constant use during the early th century the vaults were used to store wine as they were kept at a consistent f c temperature due to a lack of air circulation the manhattan vault was called the blue grotto because of a shrine to the virgin mary next to an opening at the entrance the vaults were closed for public use in the late s and s during world war i and prohibition but were reopened thereafter when new york magazine visited one of the cellars in it discovered a fading inscription on a wall reading who loveth not wine women and song he remaineth a fool his whole life long leaks found within the vault s spaces necessitated repairs during the late s and early s by the late s the chambers were being used to store maintenance equipment the bridge s two suspension towers are feet m tall with a footprint of by feet by m at the high water line they are built of limestone granite and rosendale cement the limestone was quarried at the clark quarry in essex county new york the granite blocks were quarried and shaped on vinalhaven island maine under a contract with the bodwell granite company and delivered from maine to new york by schooner the manhattan tower contains cubic yards m of masonry while the brooklyn tower has cubic yards m of masonry each tower contains a pair of gothic revival pointed arches through which the roadways run the arch openings are feet m tall and feet m wide the tops of the towers are located feet m above the floor of each arch opening while the floors of the openings are feet m above mean water level giving the towers a total height of feet m above mean high water the towers rest on underwater caissons made of southern yellow pine both caissons contain interior spaces that were used by construction workers the manhattan side s caisson is slightly larger measuring by feet by m and located feet m below high water while the brooklyn side s caisson measures by feet by m and is located feet m below high water the caissons were designed to hold at least the weight of the towers which would exert a pressure of short tons per square foot t m when fully built but the caissons were over engineered for safety during an accident on the brooklyn side when air pressure was lost and the partially built towers dropped full force down the caisson sustained an estimated pressure of short tons per square foot t m with only minor damage most of the timber used in the bridge s construction including in the caissons came from mills at gascoigne bluff on st simons island georgia the brooklyn side s caisson which was built first originally had a height of feet m and a ceiling composed of five layers of timber each layer foot m tall ten more layers of timber were later added atop the ceiling and the entire caisson was wrapped in tin and wood for further protection against flooding the thickness of the caisson s sides was feet m at both the bottom and the top the caisson had six chambers two each for dredging supply shafts and airlocks the caisson on the manhattan side was slightly different because it had to be installed at a greater depth to protect against the increased air pressure at that depth the manhattan caisson had layers of timber on its roof seven more than its brooklyn counterpart had the manhattan caisson also had fifty inch cm diameter pipes for sand removal a fireproof iron boilerplate interior and different airlocks and communication systems proposals for a bridge between the then separate cities of brooklyn and new york had been suggested as early as at the time the only travel between the two cities was by a number of ferry lines engineers presented various designs such as chain or link bridges though these were never built because of the difficulties of constructing a high enough fixed span bridge across the extremely busy east river there were also proposals for tunnels under the east river but these were considered prohibitively expensive the current brooklyn bridge was conceived by german immigrant john augustus roebling in he had previously designed and constructed shorter suspension bridges such as roebling s delaware aqueduct in lackawaxen pennsylvania and the john a roebling suspension bridge between cincinnati ohio and covington kentucky in february the new york state senate passed a bill that allowed the construction of a suspension bridge from brooklyn to manhattan two months later the new york and brooklyn bridge company was incorporated with a board of directors later converted to a board of trustees there were twenty trustees in total eight each appointed by the mayors of new york and brooklyn as well as the mayors of each city and the auditor and comptroller of brooklyn the company was tasked with constructing what was then known as the new york and brooklyn bridge alternatively the span was just referred to as the brooklyn bridge a name originating in a january letter to the editor sent to the brooklyn daily eagle the act of incorporation which became law on april authorized the cities of new york now manhattan and brooklyn to subscribe to million in capital stock which would fund the bridge s construction roebling was subsequently named the main engineer of the work and by september had presented a master plan according to it the bridge would be longer and taller than any suspension bridge previously built it would incorporate roadways and elevated rail tracks whose tolls and fares would provide the means to pay for the bridge s construction it would also include a raised promenade that served as a leisurely pathway the proposal received much acclaim in both cities and residents predicted that the new york and brooklyn bridge s opening would have as much of an impact as the suez canal the first transatlantic telegraph cable or the first transcontinental railroad by early however some individuals started to criticize the project saying either that the bridge was too expensive or that the construction process was too difficult to allay concerns about the design of the new york and brooklyn bridge roebling set up a bridge party in march where he invited engineers and members of u s congress to see his other spans following the bridge party in april roebling and several engineers conducted final surveys during the process it was determined that the main span would have to be raised from to feet to m above mhw requiring several changes to the overall design in june while conducting these surveys roebling sustained a crush injury to his foot when a ferry pinned it against a piling after amputation of his crushed toes he developed a tetanus infection that left him incapacitated and resulted in his death the following month washington roebling john roebling s year old son was then hired to fill his father s role when the younger roebling was hired tammany hall leader william m tweed also became involved in the bridge s construction because as a major landowner in new york city he had an interest in the project s completion the new york and brooklyn bridge company later known simply as the new york bridge company was actually overseen by tammany hall and it approved roebling s plans and designated him as chief engineer of the project construction of the brooklyn bridge began on january the first work entailed the construction of two caissons upon which the suspension towers would be built the brooklyn side s caisson was built at the webb bell shipyard in greenpoint brooklyn and was launched into the river on march compressed air was pumped into the caisson and workers entered the space to dig the sediment until it sank to the bedrock as one sixteen year old from ireland frank harris described the fearful experience the six of us were working naked to the waist in the small iron chamber with the temperature of about degrees fahrenheit in five minutes the sweat was pouring from us and all the while we were standing in icy water that was only kept from rising by the terrific pressure no wonder the headaches were blinding once the caisson had reached the desired depth it was to be filled in with vertical brick piers and concrete however due to the unexpectedly high concentration of large boulders atop the riverbed the brooklyn caisson took several months to sink to the desired depth furthermore in december its timber roof caught fire delaying construction further the great blowout as the fire was called delayed construction for several months since the holes in the caisson had to be repaired on march the repairs were finished and the caisson had reached its final depth of feet m it was filled with concrete five days later overall about individuals were estimated to have worked in the caisson every day but because of high worker turnover the final total was thought to be about men in total in spite of this only a few workers were paralyzed at its final depth the caisson s air pressure was pounds per square inch kpa the manhattan side s caisson was the next structure to be built to ensure that it would not catch fire like its counterpart had the manhattan caisson was lined with fireproof plate iron it was launched from webb bell s shipyard on may and maneuvered into place that september due to the extreme underwater air pressure inside the much deeper manhattan caisson many workers became sick with the bends decompression sickness during this work despite the incorporation of airlocks which were believed to help with decompression sickness at the time this condition was unknown at the time and was first called caisson disease by the project physician andrew smith between january and may smith treated cases of decompression sickness while three workers died from the disease when iron probes underneath the manhattan caisson found the bedrock to be even deeper than expected washington roebling halted construction due to the increased risk of decompression sickness after the manhattan caisson reached a depth of feet m with an air pressure of pounds per square inch kpa washington deemed the sandy subsoil overlying the bedrock feet m beneath to be sufficiently firm and subsequently infilled the caisson with concrete in july washington roebling himself suffered a paralyzing injury as a result of caisson disease shortly after ground was broken for the brooklyn tower foundation his debilitating condition left him unable to supervise the construction in person so he designed the caissons and other equipment from his apartment directing the completion of the bridge through a telescope from his bedroom his wife emily warren roebling not only provided written communications between her husband and the engineers on site but also understood mathematics calculations of catenary curves strengths of materials bridge specifications and the intricacies of cable construction she spent the next years helping supervise the bridge s construction taking over much of the chief engineer s duties including day to day supervision and project management after the caissons were completed piers were constructed on top of each of them upon which masonry towers would be built the towers construction was a complex process that took four years since the masonry blocks were heavy the builders transported them to the base of the towers using a pulley system with a continuous inch cm diameter steel wire rope operated by steam engines at ground level the blocks were then carried up on a timber track alongside each tower and maneuvered into the proper position using a derrick atop the towers the blocks sometimes vibrated the ropes because of their weight but only once did a block fall construction on the suspension towers started in mid and by the time work was halted for the winter in late parts of each tower had already been built by mid there was substantial progress on the towers construction the brooklyn side s tower had reached a height of feet m above mean high water while the tower on the manhattan side had reached feet m above mhw the arches of the brooklyn tower were completed by august the tower was substantially finished by december with the erection of saddle plates for the main cables at the top of the tower however the ornamentation on the brooklyn tower could not be completed until the manhattan tower was finished the last stone on the brooklyn tower was raised in june and the manhattan tower was completed in july the saddle plates atop both towers were also raised in july the work was dangerous by three workers had died having fallen from the towers while nine other workers were killed in other accidents in while the towers were being constructed the project had depleted its original million budget two bridge commissioners one each from brooklyn and manhattan petitioned new york state lawmakers to allot another million for construction ultimately the legislators passed a law authorizing the allotment with the condition that the cities would buy the stock of brooklyn bridge s private stockholders work proceeded concurrently on the anchorages on each side the brooklyn anchorage broke ground in january and was subsequently substantially completed in august the manhattan anchorage was built in less time having started in may it was mostly completed in july the anchorages could not be fully completed until the main cables were spun at which point another feet m would be added to the height of each foot m anchorage the first temporary wire was stretched between the towers on august using chrome steel provided by the chrome steel company of brooklyn the wire was then stretched back across the river and the two ends were spliced to form a traveler a lengthy loop of wire connecting the towers which was driven by a horsepower kw steam hoisting engine at ground level the wire was one of two that were used to create a temporary footbridge for workers while cable spinning was ongoing the next step was to send an engineer across the completed traveler wire in a boatswain s chair slung from the wire to ensure it was safe enough the bridge s master mechanic e f farrington was selected for this task and an estimated crowd of people on both shores watched him cross a second traveler wire was then stretched across the span a task that was completed by august the temporary footbridge located some feet m above the elevation of the future deck was completed in february by december a steel contract for the permanent cables still had not been awarded there was disagreement over whether the bridge s cables should use the as yet untested bessemer steel or the well proven crucible steel until a permanent contract was awarded the builders ordered short tons long tons of wire in the interim tons each from three companies including washington roebling s own steel mill in brooklyn in the end it was decided to use number birmingham gauge approximately mm or inches in diameter crucible steel and a request for bids was distributed to which eight companies responded in january a contract for crucible steel was awarded to j lloyd haigh who was associated with bridge trustee abram hewitt whom roebling distrusted the spinning of the wires required the manufacture of large coils of it which were galvanized but not oiled when they left the factory the coils were delivered to a yard near the brooklyn anchorage there they were dipped in linseed oil hoisted to the top of the anchorage dried out and spliced into a single wire and finally coated with red zinc for further galvanizing there were thirty two drums at the anchorage yard eight for each of the four main cables each drum had a capacity of feet m of wire the first experimental wire for the main cables was stretched between the towers on may and spinning began two weeks later all four main cables were being strung by that july during that time the temporary footbridge was unofficially opened to members of the public who could receive a visitor s pass by august several thousand visitors from around the world had used the footbridge the visitor passes ceased that september after a visitor had an epileptic seizure and nearly fell off as the wires were being spun work also commenced on the demolition of buildings on either side of the river for the brooklyn bridge s approaches this work was mostly complete by september the following month initial contracts were awarded for the suspender wires which would hang down from the main cables and support the deck by may the main cables were more than two thirds complete however the following month one of the wires slipped killing two people and injuring three others in hewitt wrote a letter urging against the use of bessemer steel in the bridge s construction bids had been submitted for both crucible steel and bessemer steel john a roebling s sons submitted the lowest bid for bessemer steel but at hewitt s direction the contract was awarded to haigh a subsequent investigation discovered that haigh had substituted inferior quality wire in the cables of eighty rings of wire that were tested only five met standards and it was estimated that haigh had earned from the deception at this point it was too late to replace the cables that had already been constructed roebling determined that the poorer wire would leave the bridge only four times as strong as necessary rather than six to eight times as strong the inferior quality wire was allowed to remain and extra wires were added to each cable to avoid public controversy haigh was not fired but instead was required to personally pay for higher quality wire d the contract for the remaining wire was awarded to the john a roebling s sons and by october the last of the main cables wires went over the river after the suspender wires had been placed workers began erecting steel crossbeams to support the roadway as part of the bridge s overall superstructure construction on the bridge s superstructure started in march but as with the cables the trustees initially disagreed on whether the steel superstructure should be made of bessemer or crucible steel that july the trustees decided to award a contract for short tons long tons of bessemer steel to the edgemoor or edge moor iron works based in philadelphia to be delivered by the trustees later passed another resolution for another short tons long tons of bessemer steel however by february the steel deliveries had not started that october the bridge trustees questioned edgemoor s president about the delay in steel deliveries despite edgemoor s assurances that the contract would be fulfilled the deliveries still had not been completed by november brooklyn mayor seth low who became part of the board of trustees in became the chairman of a committee tasked to investigate edgemoor s failure to fulfill the contract when questioned edgemoor s president stated that the delays were the fault of another contractor the cambria iron company who was manufacturing the eyebars for the bridge trusses at that point the contract was supposed to be complete by october further complicating the situation washington roebling had failed to appear at the trustees meeting in june since he had gone to newport rhode island after the news media discovered this most of the newspapers called for roebling to be fired as chief engineer except for the daily state gazette of trenton new jersey and the brooklyn daily eagle some of the longstanding trustees including henry c murphy james s t stranahan and william c kingsley were willing to vouch for roebling since construction progress on the brooklyn bridge was still ongoing however roebling s behavior was considered suspect among the younger trustees who had joined the board more recently construction on the bridge itself was noted in formal reports that murphy presented each month to the mayors of new york and brooklyn for example murphy s report in august noted that the month s progress included intermediate cords erected within a week as well as diagonal stays posts and numerous floor beams bridging trusses and stay bars by early the brooklyn bridge was considered mostly completed and was projected to open that june contracts for bridge lighting were awarded by february and a toll scheme was approved that march there was substantial opposition to the bridge s construction from shipbuilders and merchants located to the north who argued that the bridge would not provide sufficient clearance underneath for ships in may these groups led by abraham miller filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against the cities of new york and brooklyn in an assembly sub committee on commerce and navigation began an investigation into the brooklyn bridge a seaman who had been hired to determine the height of the span testified to the committee about the difficulties that ship masters would experience in bringing their ships under the bridge when it was completed another witness edward wellman serrell a civil engineer said that the calculations of the bridge s assumed strength were incorrect the supreme court decided in that the brooklyn bridge was a lawful structure the new york and brooklyn bridge was opened for use on may thousands of people attended the opening ceremony and many ships were present in the east river for the occasion officially emily warren roebling was the first to cross the bridge the bridge opening was also attended by u s president chester a arthur and new york mayor franklin edson who crossed the bridge and shook hands with brooklyn mayor seth low at the brooklyn end abram hewitt gave the principal address it is not the work of any one man or of any one age it is the result of the study of the experience and of the knowledge of many men in many ages it is not merely a creation it is a growth it stands before us today as the sum and epitome of human knowledge as the very heir of the ages as the latest glory of centuries of patient observation profound study and accumulated skill gained step by step in the never ending struggle of man to subdue the forces of nature to his control and use though washington roebling was unable to attend the ceremony and rarely visited the site again he held a celebratory banquet at his house on the day of the bridge opening further festivity included the performance by a band gunfire from ships and a fireworks display on that first day a total of vehicles and people crossed the span less than a week after the brooklyn bridge opened ferry crews reported a sharp drop in patronage while the bridge s toll operators were processing over a hundred people a minute however cross river ferries continued to operate until the bridge had cost us million in dollars about us in to build of which brooklyn paid two thirds the bonds to fund the construction would not be paid off until an estimated men died during its construction since the new york and brooklyn bridge was the only bridge across the east river at that time it was also called the east river bridge until the construction of the nearby williamsburg bridge in the new york and brooklyn bridge was the longest suspension bridge in the world longer than any built previously at the time of opening the brooklyn bridge was not complete the proposed public transit across the bridge was still being tested while the brooklyn approach was being completed on may six days after the opening a woman falling down a stairway at the brooklyn approach caused a stampede which resulted in at least twelve people being crushed and killed in subsequent lawsuits the brooklyn bridge company was acquitted of negligence however the company did install emergency phone boxes and additional railings and the trustees approved a fireproofing plan for the bridge public transit service began with the opening of the new york and brooklyn bridge railway a cable car service on september on may one of the circus master p t barnum s most famous attractions jumbo the elephant led a parade of elephants over the brooklyn bridge this helped to lessen doubts about the bridge s stability while also promoting barnum s circus patronage across the brooklyn bridge increased in the years after it opened a million people paid to cross in the six first months the bridge carried million people in its first full year of operation this number doubled to million in and again to million in many of these people were cable car passengers additionally about million pedestrians a year were crossing the bridge for free by the first proposal to make changes to the bridge was sent in only two and a half years after it opened when linda gilbert suggested glass steam powered elevators and an observatory be added to the bridge and a fee charged for use which would in part fund the bridge s upkeep and in part fund her prison reform charity this proposal was considered but not acted upon numerous other proposals were made during the first fifty years of the bridge s life trolley tracks were added in the center lanes of both roadways in allowing trolleys to use the bridge as well that year the formerly separate city of brooklyn was unified with new york city and the brooklyn bridge fell under city control concerns about the brooklyn bridge s safety were raised during the turn of the century in traffic backups due to a dead horse caused one of the truss cords to buckle there were more significant worries after twelve suspender cables snapped in though a thorough investigation found no other defects after the incident five inspectors were hired to examine the bridge each day a service that cost a year the brooklyn rapid transit company which operated routes across the brooklyn bridge issued a notice in saying that the bridge had reached its transit capacity by due to the popularity of the brooklyn bridge there were proposals to construct other bridges across the east river between manhattan and long island although a second deck for the brooklyn bridge was proposed it was thought to be infeasible because doing so would overload the bridge s structural capacity the first new bridge across the east river the williamsburg bridge opened upstream in and connected williamsburg brooklyn with the lower east side of manhattan this was followed by the queensboro bridge between queens and manhattan in march and the manhattan bridge between brooklyn and manhattan in december several subway railroad and road tunnels were also constructed which helped to accelerate the development of manhattan brooklyn and queens though tolls had been instituted for carriages and cable car customers since the bridge s opening pedestrians were spared from the tolls originally however by the first decade of the th century pedestrians were also paying tolls tolls on all four bridges across the east river the brooklyn bridge as well as the manhattan williamsburg and queensboro bridges to the north were abolished in july as part of a populist policy initiative headed by new york city mayor william jay gaynor the city government passed a bill to officially name the structure the brooklyn bridge in january ostensibly in an attempt to reduce traffic on nearby city streets grover whalen the commissioner of plant and structures banned motor vehicles from the brooklyn bridge in the real reason for the ban was an incident the same year where two cables slipped due to high traffic loads both whalen and roebling called for the renovation of the brooklyn bridge and the construction of a parallel bridge though the parallel bridge was never built the first major upgrade to the brooklyn bridge commenced in when a contract for redesigning the roadways were awarded to david b steinman the renovation was expected to double the capacity of the bridge s roadways to nearly cars per hour at a projected cost of million the renovation included the demolition of both the elevated and the trolley tracks on the roadways the removal of trusses separating the inner elevated tracks from the existing vehicle lanes and the widening of each roadway from two to three lanes as well as the construction of a new steel and concrete floor in addition new ramps were added to adams street cadman plaza and the brooklyn queens expressway bqe on the brooklyn side and to park row on the manhattan side the trolley tracks closed in march to allow for the widening work to occur during the construction project one roadway at a time was closed allowing reduced traffic flows to cross the bridge in one direction only the widened south roadway was completed in may followed by the north roadway in october the restoration was finished in may with the completion of the reconstructed elevated promenade while the rebuilding of the span was ongoing a fallout shelter was constructed beneath the manhattan approach in anticipation of the cold war the abandoned space in one of the masonry arches was stocked with emergency survival supplies for a potential nuclear attack by the soviet union these supplies remained in place half a century later in addition defensive barriers were added to the bridge as a safeguard against sabotage simultaneous with the rebuilding of the brooklyn bridge a double decked viaduct for the bqe was being built through an existing steel overpass of the bridge s brooklyn approach ramp the segment of the bqe from brooklyn bridge south to atlantic avenue opened in june but the direct ramp from the northbound bqe to the manhattan bound brooklyn bridge did not open until the city also widened the adams street approach in brooklyn between the bridge and fulton street from to feet to m between and subsequently boerum place from fulton street south to atlantic avenue was also widened this required the demolition of the old kings county courthouse the towers were cleaned in and the brooklyn anchorage was repaired the next year on the manhattan side the city approved a controversial rebuilding of the manhattan entrance plaza in the project which would add a grade separated junction over park row was hotly contested because it would require the demolition of structures including the old new york world building the reconstruction also necessitated the relocation of families on park row in december the city started a two year renovation of the plaza this required the closure of one roadway at a time as was done during the rebuilding of the bridge itself work on redeveloping the area around the manhattan approach started in the mid s at the same time plans were announced for direct ramps to the fdr drive elevated highway to alleviate congestion at the approach the ramp from the fdr drive to the brooklyn bridge was opened in followed by the ramp from the bridge to the fdr drive the next year a single ramp from the manhattan bound brooklyn bridge to northbound park row was constructed in a repainting of the bridge was announced two years later in advance of its th anniversary the brooklyn bridge gradually deteriorated due to age and neglect while it had full time dedicated maintenance workers before world war ii that number dropped to five by the late th century and the city as a whole only had bridge maintenance workers in heavy vehicles such as vans and buses were banned from the bridge to prevent further erosion of the concrete roadway a report in the new york times four years later noted that the cables were visibly fraying and the pedestrian promenade had holes in it the city began planning to replace all the brooklyn bridge s cables at a cost of million as part of a larger project to renovate all four toll free east river spans by the brooklyn bridge was in such dire condition that it faced imminent closure in some places half of the strands in the cables were broken in june two of the diagonal stay cables snapped seriously injuring a pedestrian who later died subsequently the anchorages were found to have developed rust and an emergency cable repair was necessitated less than a month later after another cable developed slack following the incident the city accelerated the timetable of its proposed cable replacement and it commenced a million rehabilitation of the brooklyn bridge in advance of the th anniversary as part of the project the bridge s original suspender cables installed by j lloyd haigh were replaced by bethlehem steel in marking the cables first replacement since construction in addition the staircase at washington street in brooklyn was renovated the stairs from tillary and adams streets were replaced with a ramp and the short flights of steps from the promenade to each tower s balcony were removed in a smaller project the bridge was floodlit at night starting in to highlight its architectural features additional problems persisted and in high levels of lead were discovered near the bridge s towers further emergency repairs were undertaken in mid after small concrete shards began falling from the bridge into the east river the concrete deck had been installed during the s renovations and had a lifespan of about years the park row exit from the bridge s westbound lanes was closed as a safety measure after the september attacks on the nearby world trade center that section of park row had been closed off since it ran right underneath police plaza the headquarters of the new york city police department nypd in early to save money on electricity the nycdot turned off the bridge s necklace lights at night they were turned back on later that year after several private entities made donations to fund the lights after the collapse of the i w bridge in minneapolis public attention focused on the condition of bridges across the u s the new york times reported that the brooklyn bridge approach ramps had received a poor rating during an inspection in however a nycdot spokesman said that the poor rating did not indicate a dangerous state but rather implied it required renovation in the nycdot began renovating the approaches and deck as well as repainting the suspension span work included widening two approach ramps from one to two lanes by re striping a new prefabricated ramp raising clearance over the eastbound bqe at york street seismic retrofitting replacement of rusted railings and safety barriers and road deck resurfacing the work necessitated detours for four years at the time the project was scheduled to be completed in but completion was later delayed to then again to the project s cost also increased from million in to million in in august after the renovation had been completed the nycdot announced that it would conduct a seven month study to verify if the bridge could support a heavier upper deck that consisted of an expanded bicycle and pedestrian path as of update about pedestrians and cyclists use the pathway on an average weekday work on the pedestrian entrance on the brooklyn side was underway by the nycdot also indicated in that it planned to reinforce the brooklyn bridge s foundations to prevent it from sinking as well as repair the masonry arches on the approach ramps which had been damaged by hurricane sandy in in july the new york city landmarks preservation commission approved a further renovation of the brooklyn bridge s suspension towers and approach ramps that december the federal government gave the city million in funding which would pay for a million rehabilitation of the bridge approaches and the suspension towers work started in late and was scheduled to be completed in in early city council speaker corey johnson and the nonprofit van alen institute hosted an international contest to solicit plans for the redesign of the bridge s walkway ultimately in january the city decided to install a two way protected bike path on the manhattan bound roadway replacing the leftmost vehicular lane the bike lane would allow the existing promenade to be used exclusively by pedestrians work on the bike lane started in june and the new path was completed on september horse drawn carriages have been allowed to use the brooklyn bridge s roadways since its opening originally each of the two roadways carried two lanes of a different direction of traffic the lanes were relatively narrow at only feet m wide in motor vehicles were banned from the bridge while horse drawn carriages were restricted from the manhattan bridge thereafter the only vehicles allowed on the brooklyn bridge were horse drawn after the main roadway carried six lanes of automobile traffic three in each direction it was then reduced to five lanes with the addition of a two way bike lane on the manhattan bound side in because of the roadway s height ft m posted and weight lb kg posted restrictions commercial vehicles and buses are prohibited from using the brooklyn bridge the weight restrictions prohibit heavy passenger vehicles such as pickup trucks and suvs from using the bridge though this is not often enforced in practice on the brooklyn side vehicles can enter the bridge from tillary adams streets to the south sands pearl streets to the west and exit b of the eastbound brooklyn queens expressway in manhattan cars can enter from both the northbound and southbound fdr drive as well as park row to the west chambers centre streets to the north and pearl street to the south however the exit from the bridge to northbound park row was closed after the september attacks because of increased security concerns that section of park row ran under one police plaza the nypd headquarters vehicular access to the bridge is provided by a complex series of ramps on both sides of the bridge there are two entrances to the bridge s pedestrian promenade on either side formerly rail traffic operated on the brooklyn bridge as well cable cars and elevated railroads used the bridge until while trolleys ran until the new york and brooklyn bridge railway a cable car service began operating on september it ran on the inner lanes of the bridge between terminals at the manhattan and brooklyn ends since washington roebling believed that steam locomotives would put excessive loads upon the structure of the brooklyn bridge the cable car line was designed as a steam cable hauled hybrid they were powered from a generating station under the brooklyn approach the cable cars could not only regulate their speed on the upward and downward approaches but also maintain a constant interval between each other there were cable cars in total initially the service ran with single car trains but patronage soon grew so much that by october two car trains were in use the line carried three million people in the first six months nine million in and nearly million in following the opening of the brooklyn union elevated railroad accordingly the track layout was rearranged and more trains were ordered at the same time there were highly controversial plans to extend the elevated railroads onto the brooklyn bridge under the pretext of extending the bridge itself after disputes the trustees agreed to build two elevated routes to the bridge on the brooklyn side patronage continued to increase and in the tracks were lengthened and even more cars were constructed to allow for four car cable car trains electric wires for the trolleys were added by allowing for the potential future decommissioning of the steam cable system the terminals were rebuilt once more in july and following the implementation of new electric cars in late the steam engines were dismantled and sold following the unification of the cities of new york and brooklyn in the new york and brooklyn bridge railway ceased to be a separate entity that june and the brooklyn rapid transit company brt assumed control of the line the brt started running through services of elevated trains which ran from park row terminal in manhattan to points in brooklyn via the sands street station on the brooklyn side before reaching sands street at tillary street for fulton street line trains and at bridge street for fifth avenue line and myrtle avenue line trains elevated trains bound for manhattan were uncoupled from their steam locomotives the elevated trains were then coupled to the cable cars which would pull the passenger carriages across the bridge the brt did not run any elevated train through services from to due to increased patronage after the opening of the interborough rapid transit company irt s first subway line the park row station was rebuilt in in the early th century there were plans for brooklyn bridge elevated trains to run underground to the brt s proposed chambers street station in manhattan though the connection was never opened the overpass across william street was closed in to make way for the proposed connection in the overpass was reopened after it became clear that the connection would not be built after the irt s joralemon street tunnel and the williamsburg bridge tracks opened in the brooklyn bridge no longer held a monopoly on rail service between manhattan and brooklyn and cable service ceased new subway lines from the irt and from the brt s successor brooklyn manhattan transit corporation bmt built in the s and s posed significant competition to the brooklyn bridge rail services with the opening of the independent subway system in and the subsequent unification of all three companies into a single entity in the elevated services started to decline and the park row and sands street stations were greatly reduced in size the fifth avenue and fulton street services across the brooklyn bridge were discontinued in and respectively and the elevated tracks were abandoned permanently with the withdrawal of myrtle avenue services in a plan for trolley service across the brooklyn bridge was presented in two years later the brooklyn bridge trustees agreed to a plan where trolleys could run across the bridge under ten year contracts trolley service which began in ran on what are now the two middle lanes of each roadway shared with other traffic when cable service was withdrawn in the trolley tracks on the brooklyn side were rebuilt to alleviate congestion trolley service on the middle lanes continued until the elevated lines stopped using the bridge in when they moved to the protected center tracks on march the streetcars also stopped running and the bridge was redesigned exclusively for automobile traffic the brooklyn bridge has an elevated promenade open to pedestrians in the center of the bridge located feet m above the automobile lanes the promenade is usually located feet m below the height of the girders except at the approach ramps leading to each tower s balcony the path is generally to feet to m wide though this is constrained by obstacles such as protruding cables benches and stairways which create pinch points at certain locations the path narrows to feet m at the locations where the main cables descend to the level of the promenade further exacerbating the situation these pinch points are some of the most popular places to take pictures as a result in the nycdot announced that it planned to double the promenade s width a center line was painted to separate cyclists from pedestrians in creating one of the city s first dedicated bike lanes initially the northern side of the promenade was used by pedestrians and the southern side by cyclists in these were swapped with cyclists taking the northern side and pedestrians taking the southern side on september the dot closed off the inner most car lane on the manhattan bound side with protective barriers and fencing to create a new bike path cyclists are now prohibited from the upper pedestrian lane pedestrian access to the bridge from the brooklyn side is from either the median of adams street at its intersection with tillary street or a staircase near prospect street between cadman plaza east and west in manhattan the pedestrian walkway is accessible from crosswalks at the intersection of the bridge and centre street or through a staircase leading to park row while the bridge has always permitted the passage of pedestrians the promenade facilitates movement when other means of crossing the east river have become unavailable during transit strikes by the transport workers union in and people commuting to work used the bridge they were joined by mayors ed koch and michael bloomberg who crossed as a gesture to the affected public pedestrians also walked across the bridge as an alternative to suspended subway services following the and blackouts and after the september attacks on the world trade center during the blackouts many crossing the bridge reported a swaying motion the higher than usual pedestrian load caused this swaying which was amplified by the tendency of pedestrians to synchronize their footfalls with a sway several engineers expressed concern about how this would affect the bridge although others noted that the bridge did withstand the event and that the redundancies in its design the inclusion of the three support systems suspension system diagonal stay system and stiffening truss make it probably the best secured bridge against such movements going out of control in designing the bridge john roebling had stated that the bridge would sag but not fall even if one of these structural systems were to fail altogether there have been several notable jumpers from the brooklyn bridge the first person was robert emmet odlum brother of women s rights activist charlotte odlum smith on may he struck the water at an angle and died shortly afterwards from internal injuries steve brodie supposedly dropped from underneath the bridge in july and was briefly arrested for it though there is some doubt about whether he actually jumped larry donovan made a slightly higher jump from the railing a month afterward the first person to jump from the bridge with the intention of suicide was francis mccarey in a lesser known early jumper was james duffy of county cavan ireland who on april asked several men to watch him jump from the bridge duffy jumped and was not seen again additionally the cartoonist otto eppers jumped and survived in and was then tried and acquitted for attempted suicide the brooklyn bridge has since developed a reputation as a suicide bridge due to the number of jumpers who do so intending to kill themselves though exact statistics are difficult to find other notable feats have taken place on or near the bridge in giorgio pessi piloted what was then one of the world s largest airplanes the caproni ca under the bridge in bridge jumper thierry devaux illegally performed eight acrobatic bungee jumps above the east river close to the brooklyn tower on march lebanese born rashid baz opened fire on a van carrying members of the chabad lubavitch orthodox jewish movement striking year old student ari halberstam and three others traveling on the bridge halberstam died five days later from his wounds and baz was later convicted of murder he was apparently acting out of revenge for the hebron massacre of palestinian muslims a few days prior to the incident after initially classifying the killing as one committed out of road rage the justice department reclassified the case in as a terrorist attack the entrance ramp to the bridge on the manhattan side was subsequently dedicated as the ari halberstam memorial ramp several potential attacks or disasters have also been averted in police disarmed a stick of dynamite placed under the brooklyn approach and an artist in manhattan was later arrested for the act in truck driver iyman faris was sentenced to about years in prison for providing material support to al qaeda after an earlier plot to destroy the bridge by cutting through its support wires with blowtorches was thwarted at a m on may artist jack bashkow climbed one of the towers for bridging a media sculpture by the performance group art corporation of america inc seven artists climbed the largest bridges connected to manhattan to replace violence and fear in mass media for one day when each of the artists had reached the tops of the bridges they ignited bright yellow flares at the same moment resulting in rush hour traffic disruption media attention and the arrest of the climbers though the charges were later dropped called the first social sculpture to use mass media as art by conceptual artist joseph beuys the event was on the cover of the new york post received international attention and received abc eyewitness news best news of the year award john halpern documented the incident in the film bridging halpern attempted another bridging social sculpture in when he planted a radio receiver gunpowder and fireworks in a bucket atop one of the towers the piece was later discovered by police leading to his arrest for possessing a bomb on october more than protesters with the occupy wall street movement were arrested while attempting to march across the bridge on the roadway protesters disputed the police account of the events and claimed that the arrests were the result of being trapped on the bridge by the nypd the majority of the arrests were subsequently dismissed on july the two american flags on the flagpoles atop each tower were found to have been replaced by bleached white american flags initially cannabis activism was suspected as a motive but on august two berlin artists claimed responsibility for hoisting the two white flags having switched out the original flags with their replicas the artists said that the flags were meant to celebrate the beauty of public space and the anniversary of the death of german born john roebling and they denied that it was an anti american statement the th anniversary celebrations on may included a ceremony featuring an airplane show ships and fireworks as well as a banquet during the centennial celebrations on may president ronald reagan led a cavalcade of cars across the bridge a flotilla of ships visited the harbor officials held parades and grucci fireworks held a fireworks display that evening for the centennial the brooklyn museum exhibited a selection of the original drawings made for the bridge s construction including those by washington roebling media coverage of the centennial was declared the public relations triumph of by inc the th anniversary of the bridge s opening was celebrated by a five day event on may which included a live performance by the brooklyn philharmonic a special lighting of the bridge s towers and a fireworks display other events included a film series historical walking tours information tents a series of lectures and readings a bicycle tour of brooklyn a miniature golf course featuring brooklyn icons and other musical and dance performances just before the anniversary celebrations artist paul st george installed the telectroscope a video link on the brooklyn side of the bridge that connected to a matching device on london s tower bridge a renovated pedestrian connection to dumbo brooklyn was also reopened before the anniversary celebrations at the time of construction contemporaries marveled at what technology was capable of and the bridge became a symbol of the era s optimism john perry barlow wrote in the late th century of the literal and genuinely religious leap of faith embodied in the bridge s construction saying that the brooklyn bridge required of its builders faith in their ability to control technology the brooklyn bridge has been listed as a national historic landmark since january and was subsequently added to the national register of historic places on october the bridge has also been a new york city designated landmark since august and was designated a national historic civil engineering landmark in in addition it was placed on unesco s list of tentative world heritage sites in a bronze plaque is attached to the manhattan anchorage which was constructed on the site of the samuel osgood house at cherry street in manhattan named after samuel osgood a massachusetts politician and lawyer it was built in and served as the first u s presidential mansion the osgood house was demolished in another plaque on the manhattan side of the pedestrian promenade installed by the city in indicates the bridge s status as a city landmark the brooklyn bridge has had an impact on idiomatic american english for example references to selling the brooklyn bridge abound in american culture sometimes as examples of rural gullibility but more often in connection with an idea that strains credulity george c parker and william mccloundy were two early th century con men who may have perpetrated this scam successfully on unwitting tourists although the author of the brooklyn bridge a cultural history wrote no evidence exists that the bridge has ever been sold to a gullible outlander as a tourist attraction the brooklyn bridge is a popular site for clusters of love locks wherein a couple inscribes a date and their initials onto a lock attach it to the bridge and throw the key into the water as a sign of their love the practice is officially illegal in new york city and the nypd can give violators a fine nycdot workers periodically remove the love locks from the bridge at a cost of per year to highlight the brooklyn bridge s cultural status the city proposed building a brooklyn bridge museum near the bridge s brooklyn end in the s though the museum was ultimately not constructed the plans had been established after numerous original planning documents were found in williamsburg these documents were given to the new york city municipal archives where they are normally located though the documents were briefly displayed at the whitney museum of american art in the bridge is often featured in wide shots of the new york city skyline in television and film and has been depicted in numerous works of art fictional works have used the brooklyn bridge as a setting for instance the dedication of a portion of the bridge and the bridge itself were key components in the film kate leopold furthermore the brooklyn bridge has also served as an icon of america with mentions in numerous songs books and poems among the most notable of these works is that of american modernist poet hart crane who used the brooklyn bridge as a central metaphor and organizing structure for his second book of poetry the bridge the brooklyn bridge has also been lauded for its architecture one of the first positive reviews was the bridge as a monument a harper s weekly piece written by architecture critic montgomery schuyler and published a week after the bridge s opening in the piece schuyler wrote it so happens that the work which is likely to be our most durable monument and to convey some knowledge of us to the most remote posterity is a work of bare utility not a shrine not a fortress not a palace but a bridge architecture critic lewis mumford cited the piece as the impetus for serious architectural criticism in the u s he wrote that in the s the bridge was a source of joy and inspiration in his childhood and that it was a profound influence in his adolescence later critics would regard the brooklyn bridge as a work of art as opposed to an engineering feat or a means of transport not all critics appreciated the bridge however henry james writing in the early th century cited the bridge as an ominous symbol of the city s transformation into a steel souled machine room the construction of the brooklyn bridge is detailed in numerous media sources including david mccullough s book the great bridge and ken burns s documentary brooklyn bridge it is also described in seven wonders of the industrial world a bbc docudrama series with an accompanying book as well as chief engineer washington roebling the man who built the brooklyn bridge a biography published in wikisource items

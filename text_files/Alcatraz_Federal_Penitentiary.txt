the san francisco police department tested the new radio equipment final checks and assessments were made on the first two days of august alcatraz was intended for prisoners who continuously caused trouble at other federal prisons it would be a last resort prison to hold the worst of the worst who had no hope of rehabilitation on august the first batch of prisoners arrived at alcatraz from the united states penitentiary in leavenworth kansas having traveled by rail to santa venetia california before being escorted to alcatraz they were handcuffed in high security coaches and guarded by some federal bureau of investigation fbi special agents u s marshals and railway security officials most of the prisoners were notorious bank robbers counterfeiters or murderers among the first inmates were also men from mcneil island washington on august prisoners arrived from atlanta penitentiary and from north eastern penitentiary lewisburg pennsylvania on september one prisoner arrived from washington asylum and jail and seven from the district of columbia reformatory in virginia and on september another batch of prisoners arrived by train from leavenworth prisoners continued to arrive mainly from leavenworth and atlanta into and by june the penitentiary s first anniversary it had a population of prisoners although some inmates such as verrill rapp had already been transferred from alcatraz some months earlier on alcatraz s first anniversary the bureau of prisons wrote the establishment of this institution not only provided a secure place for the detention of the more difficult type of criminal but has had a good effect upon discipline in our other penitentiaries also no serious disturbance of any kind has been reported during the year the metal detectors often overheated and had to be turned off after the teletouch corporation failed to address the problem their contract was terminated in and they were charged over for three new detectors supplied by federal laboratories on january a severe storm caused a landslide on alcatraz causing the model industries building to slide this prompted a series of changes to the structures on the island a riprap was built around the model industries building it was strengthened and a guard tower added to the roof in june that same month the barracks building was remodeled into new apartments and nine single rooms for bachelors by this time there were families living on alcatraz including women and children the problems with the model industries building and continuing utility problems with some of the old buildings and systems led to extensive updates in including new tool proof grills on the ventilators of the cell house roof two new boilers installed in the power house and a new pump for salt water sanitation and guardrails added to stairways in a million redevelopment was begun including construction of the new industries building a complete overhaul of the power house with a new diesel engine the building of a new water tower to solve the water storage problem new apartment blocks for officers improvements to the dock and the conversion of d block into isolation cells the changes were completed in july the workshops of the new industries building became highly productive making army uniforms cargo nets and other items in high demand during world war ii in june it was reported that the federal penitentiaries had made nets alcatraz gained notoriety from its inception as the toughest prison in america considered by many the world s most fearsome prison of the day former prisoners reported brutality and inhumane conditions which severely tested their sanity ed wutke was the first prisoner to commit suicide in alcatraz rufe persful chopped off his fingers after grabbing an axe from the firetruck begging another inmate to do the same to his other hand one writer described alcatraz as the great garbage can of san francisco bay into which every federal prison dumped its most rotten apples in the new u s attorney general frank murphy attacked the penitentiary saying the whole institution is conductive to psychology that builds up a sinister ambitious attitude among prisoners the prison s reputation was not helped by the arrival of more of america s most dangerous felons including robert stroud the birdman of alcatraz in he entered the prison system at age and never left spending years at alcatraz stroud killed a guard tangled with other inmates and spent of his years in prison in solitary confinement despite its reputation with many former inmates calling it hellcatraz some prisoners reported that the living conditions there were much better than most other prisons in the country especially the food and many volunteered to come to alcatraz on december henri young murdered fellow inmate rufus mccain running downstairs from the furniture shop to the tailor s shop where mccain worked young violently stabbed mccain in the neck mccain died five hours later young had been sent to alcatraz for murder in and was later involved in an escape attempt during which gangster doc barker was shot to death he spent nearly months in solitary confinement as a result but was eventually permitted to work in the furniture shop young went to trial in with his attorneys claiming that their client could not be held responsible for the murder since he had allegedly been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment by prison guards prior to the act the trial brought alcatraz into further disrepute ultimately young was convicted of manslaughter and his prison sentence was only extended by a few years by the s conditions at alcatraz had improved and inmates were gradually permitted more privileges such as playing musical instruments watching movies on weekends painting and radio use the strict code of silence became more relaxed and prisoners were permitted to talk quietly however it was by far the most expensive prison in the united states and many still perceived it as america s most extreme jail in his annual report for bureau of prisons director james v bennett called for a more centralized institution to replace alcatraz a report indicated that the facility was over three times more expensive to run than the average american prison per prisoner per day compared to in most other prisons the problem was made worse by the buildings structural deterioration from exposure to salt spray which would require million to fix major repairs began in but by engineers considered the prison a lost cause attorney general robert f kennedy submitted plans for a new maximum security institution at marion illinois the june escape from alcatraz led to acrimonious investigations combined with the major structural problems and expensive operation this led to its closure on march the final bureau of prisons report said of alcatraz the institution served an important purpose in taking the strain off the older and greatly overcrowded institutions in atlanta leavenworth and mcneil island since it enabled us to move to the smaller closely guarded institution for the escape artists the big time racketeers the inveterate connivers and those who needed protection from other groups the former prison and island are now a museum it is one of san francisco s major tourist attractions drawing in some million visitors annually visitors arrive by boat and are given a tour of the cellhouse and island and a slide show and audio narration with anecdotes from former inmates guards and rangers on alcatraz the atmosphere of the former penitentiary is still considered to be eerie ghostly and chilling protected by the national park service and the national register of historic places the salt damaged buildings of the former prison are now being restored and maintained according to the prison s correctional officers once a convict arrived on the alcatraz wharf his first thoughts were on how to leave during its years of operation the penitentiary claimed that no prisoner successfully escaped a total of prisoners made escape attempts two men trying twice were caught six were shot and killed during their escape two drowned and five are listed as missing and presumed drowned the first escape attempt was made on april by joseph bowers who was assigned to burn trash at the incinerator he was scaling a chain link fence at the edge of the island when noticed when he refused orders of the correctional officer located at the west road guard tower to come down he was shot he was seriously injured in the fall from over m ft and consequently died the second escape attempt was on december by theodore cole and ralph roe during their work assignment in one of the workshops they cut the flat iron bars of the window and climbed into the bay it was a stormy day and the sea was rough they were thought dead by the prison authorities who believed that they drowned in the bay and their bodies were swept out to sea the most violent escape attempt occurred on may when a failed attempt by six prisoners led to the battle of alcatraz also known as the alcatraz blast out bernard coy joseph cretzer sam shockley clarence carnes marvin hubbard and miran thompson took control of the cell house by overpowering correctional officers and were able to enter the weapons room where they then demanded keys to the outside recreation door a quick thinking guard william miller turned over all but the key to the outer door which he pocketed the prisoners aim was to escape by boat from the dock but when they were unable to open the outside door they decided to battle it out they held miller and a second guard hostage prompted by shockley and thompson cretzer shot the hostages at very close range miller succumbed to his injuries while the second guard harold stites was also killed at the cell house although shockley thompson and carnes returned to their cells the other three coy cretzer and hubbard persisted with their fight the u s marines intervened and killed the three prisoners in this battle apart from the guards and prisoners killed other guards and one prisoner were also injured shockley thompson and carnes were tried for the killing of the correctional officers shockley and thompson were sentenced to death in the gas chamber which was carried out at san quentin in december however carnes who was only years of age was given a second life sentence on june frank morris john anglin and clarence anglin attempted to escape using careful planning behind their cells in cell block b was a foot m wide unguarded utility corridor the prisoners chiseled away the salt damaged concrete from around an air vent leading to this corridor using tools such as a metal spoon soldered with silver from a dime and an electric drill improvised from a stolen vacuum cleaner motor the noise was disguised by accordions played during music hour and the progress was concealed by false walls which in the dark recesses of the cells fooled the guards the escape route led up through a fan vent the prisoners removed the fan and motor replacing them with a steel grill and leaving a shaft large enough for a prisoner to enter stealing a carborundum abrasive cord from the prison workshop the prisoners then removed the rivets from the grill in their beds they placed papier m ch dummies made with human hair stolen from the barbershop over many weeks the escapees also made an inflatable raft from over stolen raincoats which they prepared on the top of the cell block concealed from the guards by sheets which had been put up over the sides they escaped through a vent in the roof and departed alcatraz the fbi investigation was aided by another prisoner allen west who was part of the escapees group but was left behind west s false wall kept slipping so he held it in place with cement which set when morris and the anglins accelerated the schedule west desperately chipped away at the wall but by the time he got out his companions were gone hundreds of leads and theories have been pursued by the fbi and local law enforcement officials in the ensuing years but no conclusive evidence has ever surfaced favoring the success or failure of the attempt the fbi s investigation was eventually closed in december the official report on the escape concludes that the prisoners drowned in the cold waters of the bay while trying to reach the mainland it being unlikely that they made the miles km to shore due to the strong ocean currents and the cold sea water temperatures ranging between to f to c the u s marshals service case file remains open and active morris and the anglin brothers remain on its wanted list circumstantial evidence uncovered in the early s seemed to suggest that the men had survived and that contrary to the official fbi report of the escapee s raft never being recovered and no car thefts being reported a raft was discovered on nearby angel island with footprints leading away and a blue chevrolet had been stolen on the night of the escape by three men who could have been morris and the anglins and that officials then engaged in a cover up relatives of the anglin brothers presented further circumstantial evidence in the mid s in support of a longstanding rumor that the anglin brothers had fled to brazil following the escape a facial recognition analyst concluded that the one piece of physical evidence a photograph of two men resembling john and clarence anglin did support that conclusion the prison initially had a staff of including the first warden james a johnston and associate warden cecil j shuttleworth both considered to be iron men none of the staff were trained in rehabilitation but were highly trained in security the guards and staff s salaries varied a new guard arriving in december was offered per year but there was a deduction for retirement taxes a year amounting to the guards typically worked hour weeks with five hour shifts guards who worked between pm and am were given a increase and guards doing overtime had to be reported and authorized by the warden officers generally had to pay cents for meals and were charged to rent an apartment on the island to include laundry service although larger families were charged anything from a month for larger quarters and charged additional for laundry in a bureau of prisons booklet revealed that the average prison population between and was the highest recorded was in and the lowest recorded was in the main administration center was at the entrance to the prison which included the warden s office the office contained a desk with radio and telegraph equipment typewriter and a telephone the administrative office section also had the offices of the associate warden and secretary mail desk captain s desk a business office a clerk s office an accounting office a control room which was added with modern technology in the officer s lounge armory and vault and a visiting area and restrooms the basement of alcatraz prison contained dungeons and the showers the main stairway to the dungeon lay along sunrise alley at the side of a block but the dungeons were also accessible by a staircase in a trapdoor along the corridor of d block all visits to alcatraz required prior written approval from the warden a hospital had originally been installed at alcatraz during its time as a military prison in the late th century during its time as a federal penitentiary it was located above the dining hall on the second floor hospital staff were u s public health service employees assigned to the federal prison service at alcatraz doctors often lasted fewer than several days or months at alcatraz because few of them could tolerate the violent inmates who would often terrify them if they failed to be given certain drugs prisoners in ill health were often kept in the hospital most famously stroud and al capone who spent years in it when the bureau of prisons established the federal penitentiary on january they took measures to strengthen the security of the prison cells to make alcatraz escape proof and also to improve living conditions for their own staff up to date technologies for enhancing security and comfort were added to the buildings guard towers were built outside at four strategic locations cells were rebuilt and fitted with tool proof steel cell fronts and locking devices operated from control boxes and windows were made covered with iron grills electromagnetic metal detectors were placed at the entrances of the dining hall and workshops with remote controlled tear gas canisters at appropriate locations remote controlled gun galleries with machine gun armed guards were installed to patrol along the corridors improvements were made to the toilet and electricity facilities old tunnels were sealed up with concrete to avoid hiding and escape by prisoners and substantial changes and improvements were made to the housing facilities of guards wardens and captain to live with their families with quality relative to rank warden johnston u s attorney general homer cummings and sanford bates first director of the bureau of prisons collaborated very closely to create a legendary prison suited to the times which resulted in the alcatraz island federal penitentiary being nicknamed uncle sam s devil s island despite alcatraz being designed to house the worst of the worst of criminals who caused problems at other prisons under the guidelines and regulations set by the strict prison administrators courts could not direct a prisoner to be directly sent to alcatraz however notorious they were for misbehavior and attempted escape from other prisons prisoners entering alcatraz would undergo vigorous research and assessments prior to their arrival security in the prison was very tight with constant checking of bars doors locks electrical fixtures and other physical security prisoners were normally counted times daily and the ratio of prisoners to guards was the lowest of any american prison of the time the front door was made of solid steel virtually impossible for any prisoners to escape through the island had many guard towers most of which have since been demolished which were heavily guarded at various points in the day at times when security may have been breached for instance there were guard towers on each of the industry buildings to ensure that inmates didn t attempt to escape during the work day shifts the recreation yard and other parts of the prison had a foot fence around it topped with barbed wire should any inmates attempt to escape during exercise one former employee of the jail likened his prison job to being a zoo keeper or his old farm job due to the fact that prisoners were treated like animals sending them out to plow the fields when some of them worked during the day and then counting them up and feeding them and so on he referred to those four years of his life working in the prison as a total waste of his life the corridors were regularly patrolled by the guards with passing gates along them the most heavily trafficked corridor was broadway between b and c block due to its being the central corridor of the prison and passed not only by guards but other prison workers at the end of each minute meal in the dining hall the forks spoons and knives were laid out on the table and carefully counted to ensure that nothing had been taken as a potential weapon in the earlier years as a prison prisoners were forbidden from talking while eating but this was later relaxed provided that the prisoners communicated quietly the gun gallery was situated in the recreation yard and mounted on one of the dining hall s exterior walls there was a metal detector outside of the dining hall for security purposes the dining hall had tear gas canisters attached to the rafters of the ceiling which could be activated by remote control should prisoners riot or attempt to escape the first warden james a johnston always entered the dining hall alone and unarmed due to heavy guarding around him several riots did break out in the dining hall during alcatraz s history those prisoners who were not involved in the fighting hid under the dining hall tables to escape possible gunfire paul joseph madigan was the third warden of alcatraz he had earlier served as the last associate warden during the term of james a johnston he was the only warden who had worked his way up from the bottom of the ranks of the prison staff hierarchy having worked originally as a correctional officer on alcatraz from the s on may madigan was the key to quashing an escape attempt after being held hostage in the model industries building which later led to his promotion as associate warden he was a stout ruddy faced pipe smoking devout irish catholic unlike his predecessors madigan was known for being more lenient and softer in his approach to administering the prison and was better liked by the prison staff olin guy blackwell was the fourth and final warden of alcatraz associate warden to paul j madigan from april blackwell served as warden of alcatraz at its most difficult time from to when it was facing closure as a decaying prison with financing problems coinciding with the timing of the infamous june escape from alcatraz at the time of the escape he was on vacation in lake berryessa in napa county and he did not believe the men could have survived the waters and made it to shore blackwell was considered to have been the least strict warden of alcatraz perhaps in part due to him having been a heavy drinker and smoker nicknamed gypsy and known as blackie to his friends he was said to have been an excellent marksman who had earlier served as associate warden of lewisburg federal penitentiary an inmate register reveals that there were prisoners in total held at alcatraz during its time as a federal penitentiary although figures reported have varied and some have stated the prison cells purposefully designed so that none adjoined an outside wall typically measured feet m by feet m and feet m high the cells were primitive with a bed a desk and a washbasin and toilet on the back wall and few furnishings except a blanket an air vent measuring inches mm by inches mm covered by a metal grill lay at the back of the cells which led into the utility corridors prisoners had no privacy in going to the toilet and the toilets would emit a strong stench because they were flushed with salt water hot water taps were not installed until the early s shortly before closure the penitentiary established a very strict regimen of rules and regulations under the title the rules and regulations for the government and discipline of the united states penal and correctional institutions and also a daily routine of work and counts to be followed by the prisoners and also the guards copies of these were provided to the prisoners to read and follow inmates were basically entitled to food clothing shelter and medical attention anything else was seen as a privilege inmates were given a blue shirt grey pants blue and white in later years cotton long underwear socks and a blue handkerchief the wearing of caps was forbidden in the cellhouse cells were expected to be kept tidy and in good order any dangerous article found in the cells or on inmates such as money narcotics intoxicating substances or tools which had the potential to inflict injury or assist in an escape attempt was considered contraband and made the prisoners eligible for disciplinary action it was compulsory for prisoners to shave in their cells three times a week attempting to bribe intimidate or assault prison officers was seen as a very serious offense african americans were segregated from the rest in cell designation due to racial abuse being prevalent toilet paper matches soap and cleanser were issued to the cells on tuesdays and saturdays and inmates could request hot water and a mop to clean their cells the bars windows and floors of the prison were cleaned on a daily basis in earlier years there was a strict code of silence but by the s this had relaxed and talking was permitted in the cellhouse and dining hall provided conversations were quiet and there was no shouting loud talking whistling or singing prisoners would be woken at am and sent to breakfast at am after returning to the cell inmates then had to tidy their cell and place the waste basket outside at am work started in the shifts for those privileged enough to do so punctuated by a whistle and prisoners would have to go through a metal detector during work shifts if assigned a job prisoners had to accept that line of work prisoners were not permitted to have money in their possessions but earnings went into a prisoner s trust fund some of the prisoners were assigned duties with the guards and foremen in the laundry tailor shop cobblers shop model shop etc and in gardening and labor smoking a privilege was permitted in the workplace providing that it would not be hazardous but inmates were not permitted to smoke between the recreation yard and work lunch was served at am followed by a minute rest in the cell before returning to work until dinner was served at and the prisoners would then retire to their cells to be locked in for the night at lights went off at after being locked in for the night guards usually patrolled the four cell blocks many prisoners have compared their duration at alcatraz to hell and would have preferred death to continued incarceration better source needed alcatraz library was located at the end of d block upon entering alcatraz every inmate was given a library card and a catalog of books found in the library inmates could place orders by putting a slip with their card in a box at the entrance to the dining hall before breakfast and the books would be delivered to and from their cell by a librarian the library which utilized a closed stack paging system had a collection of to books mainly left over from the army days inmates were permitted a maximum of three books in addition of up to twelve text books a bible and a dictionary they were permitted to subscribe to magazines but crime related pages were torn out and newspapers were prohibited sex crime and violence were censored from all books and magazines and the library was governed by a chaplain who regulated the censorship and the nature of the reading material to ensure that the material was wholesome failure to return books by the date given made the inmate liable to removal of privileges the average prisoner read to books a year every evening inmates would generally read books loaned from the library and usually an hour or minutes was allocated to the practicing of musical instruments from the guitar to the accordion a prison band often practiced in the dining room or auditorium above it al capone famously practiced the banjo in the shower block although most prisoners were limited to playing in their cells alone alcatraz cellhouse had a corridor naming system named after major american streets and landmarks michigan avenue was the corridor to the side of a block broadway was the central corridor in which the inmates would assemble as they massed through times square an area with a clock on the wall before entering the dining hall for their meals broadway separated block b and block c and prisoners kept along it had the least privacy in the prison the corridor between block c and the library was called park avenue the corridor in d block was named sunset strip gun galleries lay at the end of each block including the west and east gun galleries a block was never modernized so retained its flat strap iron bars key locks and spiral staircases from the original military prison no inmates were permanently held there during the years alcatraz was a federal penitentiary several inmates however were held briefly in a block before a hearing or transfer in the later years a block was mainly used for storage a law library was set up at some point where inmates could type legal documents a small barber s shop was located at the end of a block where inmates would have a monthly haircut most new inmates at alcatraz were assigned to the second tier of b block they had quarantine status for their first three months in confinement in alcatraz and were not permitted visitors for a minimum of days inmates were permitted one visitor a month although anybody likely to cause trouble such as registered criminals were barred from visiting letters received by inmates were checked by prison staff first to see if they could decipher any secret messages frank morris and his fellow escapees escaped alcatraz during the june escape from alcatraz by entering a utility corridor behind b block d block gained notoriety as a treatment block for some of the worst inmates with varying degrees of punishment including isolation solitary and strip prisoners usually spent anywhere from to days in solitary prisoners held here would be given their meals in their cells were not permitted to work and could only shower twice a week after a escape attempt in which arthur doc barker was killed the bureau of prisons tightened security in the d block the birdman of alcatraz inhabited cell in d block in solitary confinement for years the worst cells for confinement as a punishment for inmates who stepped out of line were located at the end of d block in cells known as the hole inmates held in the hole were limited to just one minute shower and an hour of exercise in the yard a week the five cells of the hole had nothing but a sink and toilet the very worst cell was the final cell nicknamed the oriental or strip cell which contained nothing but a hole in the floor as a toilet and in which prisoners would often be confined naked with nothing else for two days the guards controlled the flushing of the toilet in the final cell after completing the punishment in the hole the prisoner could then return to his cell but would be tagged a red tag third grade denoted a prisoner who was restricted from leaving his cell for perhaps months at second grade the prisoners could receive letters and if after days they remained well behaved they would then be restored full prison privileges its size was approximately that of a regular cell feet by feet by about feet high i could just touch the ceiling by stretching out my arm you are stripped nude and pushed into the cell guards take your clothes and go over them minutely for what few grains of tobacco may have fallen into the cuffs or pockets there is no soap no tobacco no toothbrush the smell well you can describe it only by the word stink it is like stepping into a sewer it is nauseating after they have searched your clothing they throw it at you for bedding you get two blankets around in the evening you have no shoes no bed no mattress nothing but the four damp walls and two blankets the walls are painted black once a day i got three slices of bread no that is an error some days i got four slices i got one meal in five days and nothing but bread in between in the entire thirteen days i was there i got two meals i have seen but one man get a bath in solitary confinement in all the time that i have been there that man had a bucket of cold water thrown over him alcatraz dining hall often referred to as the mess hall is the dining hall where the prisoners and staff ate their meals it is a long wing on the west end of the main cellhouse of alcatraz situated in the center of the island it is connected to the block by a corridor known as times square as it passes beneath a large clock approaching the entrance way to the dining hall this wing includes the dining hall and the kitchen beyond it on the second floor was the hospital and the auditorium which was where movies were screened to the inmates at weekends dining hall protocol was a scripted process including a whistle system to indicate which block and tier of men would move into and out of the hall at any given time who sat where where to place hands and when to start eating prisoners would be awakened at am and sent to breakfast at am a breakfast menu is still preserved on the hallway board dated march the breakfast menu included assorted dry cereals steamed whole wheat a scrambled egg milk stewed fruit toast bread and butter lunch was served in the dining hall at am followed by a minute rest in the cell before returning to work until dinner was served at and the prisoners would then go to their cells at to be locked in for the night inmates were permitted to eat as much as they liked within minutes provided they left no waste waste would be reported and may make the prisoner subject to removal of privileges if they made a habit of it each dining table had benches which held up to six men although smaller tables and chairs later replaced these which seated four all of the prison population including the guards and officials would dine together thus seating over people the food served at alcatraz was reportedly the best in the united states prison system the recreation yard was the yard used by inmates of the prison between and it is located opposite the dining hall south of the end of d block facing the mainland on a raised level surrounded by a high wall and fence above it guard tower lay just to the west of the yard the gun gallery was situated in the yard mounted on one of the dining hall s exterior walls in the previously dirt covered yard was paved the yard was part of the most violent escape attempt from alcatraz in may when a group of inmates hatched a plot to obtain the key into the recreation yard kill the tower guards take hostages and use them as shields to reach the dock inmates were permitted out into the yard on saturdays and sundays and on holidays for a maximum of hours inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends the prisoners of alcatraz were permitted to play games such as baseball softball and other sports at these times and intellectual games such as chess because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it inmates were provided gloves bats and balls but no sport uniforms in there were four amateur teams the bees oaks oilers and seals named after minor league clubs and four league teams named after major league clubs the cardinals cubs giants and tigers many of the inmates used weekends in the yards to converse with each other and discuss crime the only real opportunities they had during the week for a durable conversation the warden s house is located at the northeastern end of the main cellblock next to alcatraz lighthouse the floor room mansion was built in according to the golden gate national recreational area signpost although some sources say it was built in or and had or rooms between and the four wardens of alcatraz resided here including the first warden james a johnston a house of luxury in stark contrast to the jail next to it the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here the signpost at the spot shows a photograph of a trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse the mansion had tall windows providing fine views of san francisco bay today the house is a ruin burned down by native americans during the occupation of alcatraz on june building residential apartments was the first building constructed on the island of alcatraz intended entirely for the purpose of accommodating the military officers and their families living on the island located next to the dock on the southeastern side of the island below the warden s house the three story apartment block was built in on the site of a u s army barracks which had been there from the s it functioned as the military guard barracks from until one of its largest apartments in the southwest corner was known as the cow palace and a nearby alleyway was known as chinatown the social hall also known as the officers club was a social club located on the northwestern side of the island located in proximity to the power house water tower and former military chapel bachelor quarters it formerly housed

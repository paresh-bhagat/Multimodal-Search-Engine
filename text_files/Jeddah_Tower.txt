 jeddah tower arabic previously known as kingdom tower is a skyscraper construction project currently on hold located on the north side of jeddah saudi arabia it is planned to be the first km ft tall building and the centrepiece and first phase of a development and tourist attraction known as jeddah economic city there was steady progress but in january building owner jec halted structural concrete work with the tower about one third completed due to labor issues with a contractor following the saudi arabian purge the design created by american architect adrian smith who also designed the burj khalifa incorporates many unique structural and aesthetic features the creator and leader of the project is saudi arabian prince al waleed bin talal a grandson of ibn saud and nephew of the kings of saudi arabia after ibn saud al waleed is the chairman of kingdom holding company khc which is a partner in the jeddah economic company jec which was formed in for the development of jeddah tower and city the building has been designed to a height of at least metres ft the exact height is being kept private while in development similar to the burj khalifa a at about one kilometre jeddah tower would be the tallest building or structure in the world to date standing m ft taller than the burj khalifa in dubai united arab emirates jeddah tower s hectare acre plot along with surrounding buildings will be the first of a three phase jeddah economic city development the three phase project was proposed for a large area of undeveloped waterfront land with an area of km sq mi the area is located roughly km mi north of the port city of jeddah jeddah economic city was designed by hok architects and is estimated to cost at least sr billion us billion and take around ten years to build the development is envisioned to grow into a new district of jeddah the second phase of the project will be the infrastructure development needed to support the city and the third phase has not yet been revealed the focal point of the development and jeddah tower s primary use will be to house a four seasons hotel four seasons serviced apartments class a office space and luxury condominiums the tower will also have the world s highest observatory although the jeddah economic city plot is nearly isolated from the current urban core of jeddah no land tracts of such size were available closer to the city northward is generally considered the direction in which the city will spread in the future the primary designer of jeddah tower is chicago based architect adrian smith of adrian smith gordon gill architecture as gg the same architect who designed the burj khalifa while he was working for skidmore owings merrill som for which he worked almost years as gg was formed in by adrian smith gordon gill and robert forest the development of the tower is being managed by emaar properties pjsc thornton tomasetti has been selected as the structural engineering firm and environmental systems design inc esd is a part of the as gg design team that serves as the building services engineering consultants on august it was publicly announced by kingdom holding the investment company that a contract had been signed by saudi binladin group sbg that construction was going to start soon and that the tower was expected to take months to complete while the official construction estimate is five years and three months months others calculate that it will take significantly longer over seven years based on the duration of burj khalifa s construction which was over six years with the help of cqc department besix group belgian six construct which constructed the burj khalifa was previously considered for the contract but did not win partially because sbg invested in jeddah economic company jec contributing sr billion us million towards the development of the project besix admitted in that they expected binladin group to win the contract jeddah economic company is a closed joint stock company pjsc formed in as a financial entity for jeddah tower and jeddah economic city it is made up primarily of financiers stakeholders kingdom holding company abrar holding company which is owned by samaual bakhsh and businessman abdulrahman hassan sharbately as well as the tower s own contractor saudi binladin group jec s assets have a book value of nearly sr billion broken down between a land bank of over m sq ft the jeddah economic city plot with a value of sr billion that will be used as collateral to attain bank loans and sr billion in cash kingdom holding is an investment company founded in and owned by al waleed bin talal that has assets valued at over billion with interests in many major companies such as walt disney pepsico kodak apple hewlett packard motorola time warner newscorp pinnacle infotech solutions and citigroup as well as real estate in london through its songbird estates division in may soil testing in the area cast doubt over whether the proposed location could support a skyscraper of the proposed one kilometer height and meed reported that the project had been scaled back making it up to metres ft shorter work on the foundation was scheduled to begin towards the end of statements that construction would soon begin were made starting in in august the start of construction was slated as no later than december this meant the tower was expected to be completed in though at that time it was also possible that it could still have been completed by the date the media continued to publish which was the prior estimate of late only if construction had begun promptly and gone smoothly could a late completion have been achieved reports in suggested that the project had been put on hold due to the global financial crisis of and that bechtel the former engineering firm was in the process of ending its involvement with the project kingdom holding company quickly criticized the news reports insisting that the project had not been shelved in march adrian smith of adrian smith gordon gill architecture as gg was selected as the preliminary architect though they deny involvement in the earlier mile high designs later when the proposal was more serious they won a design competition between eight leading architectural firms including kohn pedersen fox pickard chilton pelli clarke pelli and foster partners as well as the firm smith formerly worked for skidmore owings and merrill which was the final competitor in the competition before as gg was chosen in addition to burj khalifa adrian smith has designed several other recent towers the zifeng tower in nanjing china the trump international hotel tower in chicago and the jin mao tower in shanghai as well as the pearl river tower in guangzhou china the four buildings are all among the top eleven tallest in the world furthermore the pearl river tower is a unique tower that was originally designed to use zero net energy by drawing all its needed power from wind sunlight and geothermal mass though this design goal was not fully achieved in october the owners kingdom holding company signed a development agreement with emaar properties pjsc the final height of the building was questionable but it was still listed to be over kilometre kingdom holding said construction was progressing designs for the foundation were in place by early august and the contract for the piling was tendered on august langan international officially announced their involvement and that the foundation and piling had to be uniquely designed to overcome subsurface issues such as soft bedrock and porous coral rock which normally could not support a skyscraper without settling the foundation is similar to that of the burj khalifa but larger it is expected to average around m ft deep with a concrete pad of area around m sq ft the concrete must have low permeability to keep out corrosive salt water from the red sea its depth and size are also considered to be an indicator of what the tower s final height will be the piles will be up to m ft deep and the pad over m ft across yet the building which will weigh over tonnes long tons short tons is expected to settle the idea is that it settles evenly enough so that the building doesn t tip or put undue stress on the superstructure computer modelling programmes performed tests at the site to confirm that the foundation design would work a later design for the foundation to be constructed by bauer in calls for bored piles up to m ft deep which have to be installed into the difficult ground conditions some materials needed for the structure are m cu ft of concrete and t long tons short tons of steel in march and april several news agencies reported that the mile high tower design had been approved at that height and that the building would cost almost us billion sr billion this design was going to be drastically larger than the current design with a floor area of m sq ft and would have used futuristic wind aversion and energy producing technology for sustainability it and the surrounding city would have had the ability to accommodate residents and one million visitors according to ria novosti adrian smith denied that he was a part of any of the earlier designs which had been purported in the media one source even corrected its article and clarified the misunderstanding in early august the binladin group was chosen as the main construction contractor with the signing of an sr billion us billion contract which is less than it cost to build the burj khalifa us billion new renderings were revealed and on august it was widely reported that the project was a go at the m ft height a with a building area of square metres sq ft b and will take months to complete the announcement of the main construction contract signing caused kingdom holding company s stock to jump in one day in addition to khc already having reported a rise in second quarter net profit also for the first time architects gordon gill and adrian smith officially announced their involvement in the project on august it was announced that the landscaping contract for the jeddah tower was to be awarded to landtech designs a us based company who will be responsible for irrigating hectares acres of green space by using the latest technology in sustainable irrigation the supply of water to irrigate the green space would be collected through rainwater on september it was announced that financing for the jeddah tower was complete talal al maiman chief executive officer and managing director of kingdom real estate development co said in an interview we have all the investors all the finance all the money we need al maiman said it took us beyond months to convince investors working every detail and aspect of financing on october kingdom holding awarded contracts totalling million kingdom holding co has signed a deal with subul development company for the sale of land in the kingdom riyadh land project for million the kingdom riyadh land project a mixed use commercial and residential development will generate more than billion of total investment and will house up to people the final master plan contract was awarded to omrania associates and barton willmore bauer a german foundations equipment manufacturer and contractor was awarded a us million contract to support the initial phases of construction of the jeddah tower this includes the installation of bored piles with diameters of metres and metres the enabling works are expected to begin before the end of and take about months to complete on february the jeddah economic company jec announced that it had appointed an ec harris mace joint venture team to project manage the iconic jeddah tower project the team will be providing project commercial and design management for the jeddah tower development ceo of jec waleed abduljaleel batterjee said that the reason mace was hired is to use the same team that worked for the shard in london on the other hand ec harris also has a long list of projects in the region including the grand millenium al wahda hotel abu dhabi s largest hotel complex on april news was reported that the saudi water company had signed a billion riyal million supply deal with jeddah economic co for the jeddah tower project the year agreement to supply cubic metres of treated and drinking water a day enough for olympic size pools was signed by the chief executive of the jeddah based developer waleed batraji and loay al musallam head of national water company construction started on april piling was completed in december above ground construction commenced in september in late the owner of kingdom holding co which owns of the tower and the chairman of the saudi binladen group which owns and is the primary contractor were arrested as part of the saudi arabian purge construction of the tower continued although some senior managers at kingdom holding were redirected to other projects in february mounib hammoud ceo of jeddah economic city said that construction is continuing and that they hoped to open the tower by in october the central core of the tower was at floors and the walls were m ft high as of end of a reported height was m ft in march kingdom holding company signed a deal with orange business services to provide information and communication technology ict infrastructure to jeddah tower on march construction of the tower moved forward after the delay there was steady progress but in january building owner jec halted structural concrete work with the tower about one third completed due to labour issues with a contractor following the saudi arabian purge since then construction work has been stalled partially due to the covid pandemic and as of december it is uncertain if or when the tower will be finished sustainability of such a tall building would include issues such as vertical transportation limitations with elevators only being able to go so far building sway caused by wind and super column settling which occurs because concrete tends to shrink as it hydrates and settles under load whereas steel is dimensionally stable thereby causing the floors to become uneven additionally a very large core size is required in very tall buildings to support the structure as well as to house the large number of elevators needed the core size consumes a significant amount of the space on the lower and middle floors one of the ways jeddah tower attempts to overcome these issues is with its smooth sloped exterior design which although more expensive to build offers superior aerodynamic performance over stepped designs such as the burj khalifa allowing it to have a more conservative core overall this was determined by wind tunnel tests performed at burj khalifa jeddah tower will also use copious stiffening materials to prevent the excessive sway that would otherwise make the occupants of upper floors nauseated on windy days including very high strength concrete that will be up to several metres thick in certain parts of the core this along with the highly integrated steel frame and shear walls is also intended to prevent catastrophic failure of the structure in the event of a terrorist attack traditionally the space consumed by elevators was considered to make a building become increasingly less profitable past floors or so more recently it has been the advent of truly mixed use design such as shanghai tower and burj khalifa as well as improved building technology that have outdated this rule of thumb which generally applied to single use buildings like burj khalifa jeddah employs a similar y shaped triangular footprint which promotes stability and increases window views as well as a tapering form with the sheer height and wind being the biggest structural design challenge the smooth sloped fa ade of jeddah tower particularly induces a beneficial phenomenon known as wind vortex shedding normally when wind swirls around the leeward side of a building rushing in from both sides to fill the low pressure zone it would create tornado like vortices which would rock the building from side to side due to variations in pressure direction and velocity the dynamic fa ade of jeddah tower however creates an infinite timing differential whereas burj khalifa is limited by the number of steps in air pressure exertion in any one particular direction thus creating a more stable structure as there is no broad area of outstanding pressure or depression at any given time put simply a smooth taper is more aerodynamic than an irregular or jagged taper while both are advantageous over rectangular geometries at jeddah tower s height it is considered essentially unfeasible to use a traditional square design the triangular footprint and sloped exterior of jeddah tower is designed to reduce wind loads its high surface area also makes it ideal for residential use the overall design of the tower which will be located near both the red sea and the mouth of the obhur creek sharm ob hur where it widens as it meets the red sea as well as having frontage on a man made waterway and harbour that will be built around it is intended to look like a desert plant shooting upwards as a symbol of saudi arabia s growth and future as well as to add prominence to jeddah s status as the gateway into the holy city of mecca the designer s vision was one that represents the new spirit in saudi arabia smith the hectare acre area around jeddah tower will contain public space and a shopping mall as well as other residential and commercial developments and be known as the jeddah tower water front district of which the tower s site alone will take up m sq ft as with many other very tall skyscrapers including the kingdom centre in riyadh which is generally considered to have sparked the recent significant commercial developments around it in the district of olaya much of the intention of jeddah tower is to be symbolic as well as to raise the surrounding land value rather than its own profitability to that effect the tower s architect adrian smith said that the tower evokes a bundle of leaves shooting up from the ground a burst of new life that heralds more growth all around it smith states that the tower will create a landmark in which it and the surrounding jeddah economic city are interdependent talal al maiman a board member of jeddah economic company said jeddah tower will be a landmark structure that will greatly increase the value of the hundreds of other properties around it in jeddah economic city and indeed throughout north jeddah the concept of profitability derived from building high density developments and malls around such a landmark was taken from the burj khalifa where it has proven successful as its surrounding malls hotels and condominiums in the area known as downtown dubai have generated the most considerable revenue out of that project as a whole while the burj khalifa itself made little or no profit the building will have a total of elevators five of which will be double deck elevators as well as escalators the elevators are made by the finnish company kone it will also have the highest observation deck in the world to which high speed elevators will travel at up to metres feet per second km h or mph in both directions the elevators cannot go faster because the change in air pressure at such a rapid speed could cause nausea at m ft the air pressure is over kpa psi lower than at ground level a reduction in air pressure they must also be efficient so the cables are not unbearably heavy jeddah tower will have three sky lobbies where elevator transfers can be made and no elevator will go from the bottom to the highest occupied floor no official floor count has been given however smith stated in a television interview that it will be about floors more than the burj khalifa which has occupied floors leading to the inference that jeddah tower will have over floors e the tower will also feature a large roughly m ft diameter outdoor balcony known as the sky terrace on one side of the building for private use by the penthouse floor at level it is not the observation deck it was originally intended to be a helipad but it was revealed to be an unsuitable landing environment by helicopter pilots the lower air density exacerbated by the thin desert atmosphere will cause the outdoor air temperature towards the top of the tower to be lower than the ground level air which will provide natural cooling there is also significantly more air flow wind at heights which is very strong at one kilometre and had a large impact on the structural design of the tower the burj khalifa actually takes in the cooler cleaner air from the top floors and uses it to air condition the building jeddah tower will be oriented such that no fa ade directly faces the sun it will also use the condensate water from the air conditioning system for irrigation and other purposes throughout the building to overcome elevator issues the tower will use its large number of efficient elevators as well as its three sky lobbies which allows transfers to be made between elevators serving a specific area with no elevator being overburdened much was learned from burj khalifa that helped with the design of jeddah tower not only structurally but in methods for designing practical mechanical electrical and plumbing mep systems as well as adhering to local regulations and international building codes despite all the physical challenges adrian smith states that practicality is still the greater challenge over structural durability even in such super tall designs and that as with all buildings jeddah tower s form was primarily derived respective of what the building s uses would be then in accordance with the structural factors that would have to be considered to deliver it orange s a are designing the information and communications infrastructure of the building chicago based environmental systems design inc will provide mechanical plumbing electrical and fire protection engineering as well as teledata audio visual security systems and acoustics langan international will be responsible for geotechnical engineering as well as some ground level site work such as transportation engineering and parking including the design of the proposed car underground parking garage that will be located near but not under the tower to prevent terrorism langan also designed the tower s foundation which has to be able to support the tower despite the less than optimal subsurface conditions such as soft rock and permeable coral which could cause the piles to settle thornton tomasetti has provided the structural engineering for two of the previous world s tallest building title holders the petronas towers in kuala lumpur and the taipei in taiwan as well as the under construction ping an finance centre in shenzhen which will be the second tallest building in china after completion saudi binladin group is the largest construction firm in the middle east with over workers and hundreds of projects they recently constructed the topped out m ft abraj al bait clock tower in mecca which is the tallest building in saudi arabia and third tallest in the world as well as the largest skyscraper in the world by floor area and volume aside from buildings the firm has also constructed many major infrastructure projects such as the king abdulaziz jeddah international airport expansion and the km mi six lane al qassim expressway through saudi arabia saudi binladin group is owned by the family of the late al qaeda leader osama bin laden as a result it has sparked some minor media buzz when asked his thoughts about this in an interview adrian smith simply stated that they are the largest construction firm in the middle east most significant work in saudi arabia was done by them and that it is a very large family that shouldn t be stereotyped by one of its members furthermore in january new york city judge george b daniels ruled that no charges could be filed against sbg to repay the victims of as there is no evidence of the construction firm financially supporting bin laden after he was removed as a shareholder following the world trade center bombing in addition to its primary functions the building is slated to include a significant amount of retail as well as a wide variety of other unique amenities with the intention that it functions as a nearly self sustaining entity approaching the concept of a vertical city the building s design has been applauded as simple and feasible yet bold brilliantly sculpted and high tech with as gg describing it as an elegant cost efficient and highly constructible design the estimated construction cost of us billion which is less than that of the burj khalifa us billion can be attributed to cheap labour in the middle east particularly saudi arabia and that three shifts will work around the clock to expedite the process construction costs have also declined since the global financial crisis in july a report by consultancy ec harris found that saudi arabia is the cheapest country in the middle east to build in half as expensive as bahrain and cheaper than the united arab emirates where burj khalifa is located the future towers site is located in very close proximity to king abdulaziz jeddah international airport whose runways nearly align with the towers site which will have an effect on the airspace while skyscraper experts have stated that towers well over one kilometre even two kilometres feet high are technically feasible physical sustainability and practicality issues come into play in towers of this height as for physical restraints bart leclercq head of structures for wsp middle east recently said i truly believe that mile kilometres is within range over that it may be possible if there are improvements in concrete quality but km is too big a figure it s just a step too far at the moment there is an impending real estate bubble in saudi arabia with increasing demand and rising prices due to high population growth and a short supply of housing which may include a demand for high end luxury units such as those in jeddah tower to boost growth the saudi arabian government is going to invest us billion sr billion in building homes throughout the country according to saudi officials about new homes are needed a day to meet the demand of the rapidly growing population which has nearly quadrupled in the past four decades just as the jeddah tower will complement the jeddah economic city development that will be built around it there are many infrastructure and revitalisation projects underway and planned throughout saudi arabia such as the us billion sr billion new airport terminal under construction at king abdulaziz jeddah international airport that will complement the jeddah economic city as well as develop saudi arabia which has been likened to a third world country with crumbling infrastructure and widespread disasters including severe flooding such as the flash floods in early that damaged of the roads and over buildings in jeddah according to a representative of standard chartered which invested us million in saudi binladin group saudi arabia is going to spend over us billion sr trillion on infrastructure over the next few years according to reports by citi investment research analysis billion worth of development accounting for of all construction spending in the mena region will be directly or indirectly beneficial to jeddah tower jeddah tower and city themselves are intended to set an example of green development using modern technology and having a low carbon footprint relative to the number of people they will support however there is also an increasing problem of poor education levels in arab countries due to a lack of spending in research and education which it is argued should be invested in rather than building skyscrapers and that the tower is nothing more than a symbol of hubris it has even been likened to the tower of babel furthermore economists have found large new skyscrapers to be a negative economic indicator with several instances of new tallest buildings being finished and opening into a bad economy as they generally start during a financial boom when money is easy and investment is strong but do not finish until the bubble has burst examples include the singer building and metropolitan life insurance building after the panic of wall street the chrysler building and the empire state building built during the great depression the world trade center and sears tower built during the s economic downturn the petronas towers built during the asian crisis of the late s and the burj khalifa built during the great recession much of the study on this phenomenon was done in by andrew lawrence a research director at deutsche bank who created the skyscraper index originally as a joke however it illustrated the observation that many of the world s tallest buildings have been built on the eve of financial collapse the developers theory is that the international attention gained through large developments and having the world s tallest building will incur gentrification of the country and even be a financial success in the long run architect adrian smith the designer of the tower states this tower symbolizes the kingdom as an important global business and cultural leader and demonstrates the strength and creative vision of its people it represents new growth and high performance technology fused into one powerful iconic form however bob sinn principal engineer at thornton tomasetti stated that the practical challenges of building very tall buildings are greater than the structural challenges we intend jeddah tower to become both an economic engine and a proud symbol of the kingdom s economic and cultural stature in the world community said talal al maiman a board member of both kingdom holding company and jeddah economic company the project s primary proponent prince al waleed said building this tower in jeddah sends a financial and economic message that should not be ignored it has a political depth to it to tell the world that we saudis invest in our country th floor january rd floor june th floor july at night th floor july th floor december as of june as of august it is estimated that the jeddah tower will have just over floors e

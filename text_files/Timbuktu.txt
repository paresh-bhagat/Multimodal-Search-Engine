 timbuktu t mb k tu tim buk too french tombouctou tuareg romanized tin buqt koyra chiini tumbutu is a city in mali situated twenty kilometres mi north of the niger river the town is the capital of the tombouctou region one of the eight administrative regions of mali it had a population of in the census timbuktu began as a seasonal settlement and became a permanent settlement early in the th century after a shift in trading routes particularly after the visit by mansa musa around timbuktu flourished from the trade in salt gold ivory and slaves it gradually expanded as an important islamic city on the saharan trade route and attracted many scholars and traders it became part of the mali empire early in the th century in the first half of the th century the tuareg people took control of the city for a short period until the expanding songhai empire absorbed the city in a moroccan army defeated the songhai in and made timbuktu rather than gao their capital the invaders established a new ruling class the arma who after became virtually independent of morocco the golden age of the city as a major learning and cultural centre of the mali empire was over and it entered a long period of decline different tribes governed until the french took over in a situation that lasted until it became part of the republic of mali in timbuktu is impoverished and suffers from desertification in its golden age the town s numerous islamic scholars and extensive trading network supported an important book trade together with the campuses of the sankore madrasah an islamic university this established timbuktu as a scholarly centre in africa several notable historic writers such as shabeni and leo africanus wrote about the city these stories fuelled speculation in europe where the city s reputation shifted from being extremely rich to being mysterious over the centuries the spelling of timbuktu has varied a great deal from tenbuch on the catalan atlas to traveller antonio malfante s thambet used in a letter he wrote in and also adopted by alvise cadamosto in his voyages of cadamosto to heinrich barth s timb ktu and timbu ktu french spelling often appears in international reference as tombouctou the german spelling timbuktu and its variant timbucktu have passed into english and the former has become widely used in recent years major english language works have employed the spelling timbuctoo and this is considered the correct english form by scholars timbuctou and timbuctu are sometimes used as well the french continue to use the spelling tombouctou as they have for over a century variants include temboctou used by explorer ren cailli and tombouktou but they are seldom seen variant spellings exist for other places as well such as jenne djenn and segu s gou as well as its spelling timbuktu s toponymy is still open to discussion a at least four possible origins of the name of timbuktu have been described the validity of these theories depends on the identity of the original founders of the city as recently as archaeological research has not found remains dating from the th th century within the limits of the modern city given the difficulty of excavating through metres of sand that have buried the remains over the past centuries without consensus the etymology of timbuktu remains unclear like other important medieval west african towns such as djenn jenn jeno gao and dia iron age settlements have been discovered near timbuktu that predate the traditional foundation date of the town although the accumulation of thick layers of sand has thwarted archaeological excavations in the town itself some of the surrounding landscape is deflating and exposing pottery shards on the surface a survey of the area by susan and roderick mcintosh in identified several iron age sites along the el ahmar an ancient wadi system that passes a few kilometers to the east of the modern town an iron age tell complex located nine kilometres mi southeast of the timbuktu near the wadi el ahmar was excavated between and by archaeologists from yale university and the mission culturelle de tombouctou the results suggest that the site was first occupied during the th century bc thrived throughout the second half of the st millennium ad and eventually collapsed sometime during the late th or early th century ad timbuktu was a regional trade center in medieval times where caravans met to exchange salt from the sahara desert for gold ivory and slaves from the sahel which could be reached via the nearby niger river the population population swelled from in the th century to about in the th century after the establishment of a major islamic university university of timbuktu which attracted scholars from throughout the muslim world the moroccans invaded the songhai empire in and after the battle of tondibi occupied timbuktu in most of the university faculty was executed or exiled for disloyalty to the new rulers and this along with a decline in trade caused by increased competition from newly available trans atlantic sailing routes caused the city to decline the first european to reach timbuktu alexander gordon laing did not arrive until and it was not until the s that timbuktu was formally incorporated into the french colony of mali today the city is still inhabited however the city is not as geopolitically relevant as it once was timbuktu is located on the southern edge of the sahara km mi north of the main channel of the river niger the town is surrounded by sand dunes and the streets are covered in sand the port of kabara is km mi to the south of the town and is connected to an arm of the river by a km mi canal the canal had become heavily silted but in it was dredged as part of a libyan financed project the annual flood of the niger river is a result of the heavy rainfall in the headwaters of the niger and bani rivers in guinea and northern ivory coast the rainfall in these areas peaks in august but the floodwater takes time to pass down the river system and through the inner niger delta at koulikoro km mi downstream from bamako the flood peaks in september while in timbuktu the flood lasts longer and usually reaches a maximum at the end of december in the past the area flooded by the river was more extensive and in years with high rainfall floodwater would reach the western outskirts of timbuktu itself a small navigable creek to the west of the town is shown on the maps published by heinrich barth in and f lix dubois in between and during the colonial period the french used slave labour to dig a narrow canal linking timbuktu with kabara over the following decades this became silted and filled with sand but in as part of the dredging project the canal was re excavated so that now when the river niger floods timbuktu is again connected to kabara the malian government has promised to address problems with the design of the canal as it currently lacks footbridges and the steep unstable banks make access to the water difficult kabara can only function as a port in december to january when the river is in full flood when the water levels are lower boats dock at korioum which is linked to timbuktu by km mi of paved road timbuktu features a hot desert climate bwh according to the k ppen climate classification the weather is extremely hot and dry throughout much of the year with most of the city s rainfall occurring between june and september due to the influence of the intertropical convergence zone itcz the degree of diurnal temperature variation is higher in the dry season than the wet season average daily maximum temperatures in the hottest months of the year april may and june exceed c f lowest temperatures occur during the mildest months of the year december january and february however average maximum temperatures do not drop below c f these winter months are characterized by a dry dusty trade wind blowing from the saharan tibesti region southward to the gulf of guinea picking up dust particles on their way these winds limit visibility in what has been dubbed the harmattan haze additionally when the dust settles in the city sand builds up and desertification looms the wealth and very existence of timbuktu depended on its position as the southern terminus of an important trans saharan trade route nowadays the only goods that are routinely transported across the desert are slabs of rock salt brought from the taoudenni mining centre in the central sahara km mi north of timbuktu until the second half of the th century most of the slabs were transported by large salt caravans or azalai one leaving timbuktu in early november and the other in late march the caravans of several thousand camels took three weeks each way transporting food to the miners and returning with each camel loaded with four or five kg lb slabs of salt the salt transport was largely controlled by the desert nomads of the arabic speaking berabich or barabish tribe although there are no roads the slabs of salt are now usually transported from taoudenni by truck from timbuktu the salt is transported by boat to other towns in mali between the th and th centuries timbuktu s population grew immensely due to an influx of bono tuaregs fulanis and songhais seeking trade security or to study by the population increased to and continued increasing until it reached about in the s there is insufficient rainfall in the timbuktu region for purely rain fed agriculture and crops are therefore irrigated using water from the river niger the main agricultural crop is rice african floating rice oryza glaberrima has traditionally been grown in regions near the river that are inundated during the annual flood seed is sown at the beginning of the rainy season june july so that when the flood water arrives plants are already to cm to in in height the plants grow up to three metres feet in height as the water level rises the rice is harvested by canoe in december the procedure is very precarious and the yields are low but the method has the advantage that little capital investment is required a successful crop depends critically on the amount and timing of the rain in the wet season and the height of the flood to a limited extent the arrival of the flood water can be controlled by the construction of small mud dikes that become submerged as the water rises although floating rice is still cultivated in the timbuktu cercle most of the rice is now grown in three relatively large irrigated areas that lie to the south of the town daye ha koriom ha and hamadja ha water is pumped from the river using ten large archimedes screws which were first installed in the s the irrigated areas are run as cooperatives with approximately families cultivating small plots nearly all the rice produced is consumed by the families themselves the yields are still relatively low and the farmers are being encouraged to change their agricultural practices most tourists visit timbuktu between november and february when the air temperature is lower in the s accommodation for tourists was provided by hendrina khan hotel and two other small hotels hotel bouctou and hotel azala over the following decades the tourist numbers increased so that by there were seven small hotels and guest houses the town benefited by the revenue from the cfa tourist tax the sale of handicrafts and employment of local guides starting in al qaeda in the islamic maghreb began kidnapping groups of tourists in the sahel region in january four tourists were kidnapped near the mali niger border after attending a cultural festival at anderamboukan one of these tourists was subsequently murdered as a result of this and various other incidents a number of states including france britain and the us began advising their citizens to avoid travelling far from bamako the number of tourists visiting timbuktu dropped precipitously from around in to only in the first four months of because of the security concerns the malian government moved the festival in the desert from essakane to the outskirts of timbuktu in november gunmen attacked tourists staying at a hotel in timbuktu killing one of them and kidnapping three others this was the first terrorist incident in timbuktu itself on april one day after the capture of gao timbuktu was captured from the malian military by the tuareg rebels of the mnla and ansar dine five days later the mnla declared the region independent of mali as the nation of azawad the declared political entity was not recognized by any regional nations or the international community and it collapsed three months later on july on january french and malian government troops began retaking timbuktu from the islamist rebels the force of french troops with malian soldiers retook timbuktu without a fight the islamist groups had already fled north a few days earlier having set fire to the ahmed baba institute which housed many important manuscripts the building housing the ahmed baba institute was funded by south africa and held manuscripts bbc world service radio news reported on january that approximately of the manuscripts in the institute had been removed to safety from the premises before the attack by the islamist groups and that the whereabouts of about manuscripts remained unknown it was intended to be a resource for islamic research on march jihadist rebels infiltrated into timbuktu nine days before a suicide bombing on a malian army checkpoint at the international airport killing a soldier fighting lasted until april when french warplanes helped malian ground forces chase the remaining rebels out of the city center tales of timbuktu s fabulous wealth helped prompt european exploration of the west coast of africa among the most famous descriptions of timbuktu are those of leo africanus and shabeni perhaps most famous among the accounts written about timbuktu is that by leo africanus born el hasan ben muhammed el wazzan ez zayyati in granada in his family was among the thousands of muslims expelled by king ferdinand and queen isabel after their reconquest of spain in they settled in morocco where he studied in fes and accompanied his uncle on diplomatic missions throughout north africa during these travels he visited timbuktu as a young man he was captured by pirates and presented as an exceptionally learned slave to pope leo x who freed him baptized him under the name johannis leo de medici and commissioned him to write in italian a detailed survey of africa his accounts provided most of what europeans knew about the continent for the next several centuries describing timbuktu when the songhai empire was at its height the english edition of his book includes the description the rich king of tombuto hath many plates and sceptres of gold some whereof weigh pounds he hath always horsemen and a great store of doctors judges priests and other learned men that are bountifully maintained at the king s cost and charges according to leo africanus there were abundant supplies of locally produced corn cattle milk and butter though there were neither gardens nor orchards surrounding the city in another passage dedicated to describing the wealth of both the environment and the king africanus touches upon the rarity of one of timbuktu s trade commodities salt the inhabitants are very rich especially the strangers who have settled in the country but salt is in very short supply because it is carried here from tegaza some miles km from timbuktu i happened to be in this city at a time when a load of salt sold for eighty ducats the king has a rich treasure of coins and gold ingots these descriptions and passages alike caught the attention of european explorers africanus also described the more mundane aspects of the city such as the cottages built of chalk and covered with thatch although these went largely unheeded the natives of the town of timbuctoo may be computed at exclusive of slaves and foreigners the natives are all blacks almost every stranger marries a female of the town who are so beautiful that travellers often fall in love with them at first sight shabeni in james grey jackson s fr an account of timbuctoo and hausa roughly years after leo africanus visit to timbuktu the city had seen many rulers the end of the th century saw the grip of the moroccan rulers on the city wane resulting in a period of unstable government by quickly changing tribes during the rule of one of those tribes the hausa a year old child named shabeni or shabeeny from tetuan on the north coast of morocco accompanied his father on a visit to timbuktu shabeni stayed in timbuktu for three years before moving to a major city called housa b several days journey to the southeast two years later he returned to timbuktu to live there for another seven years one of a population that was even centuries after its peak and excluding slaves double the size of the st century town by the time shabeni was he was an established merchant in his hometown of tetuan he made a two year pilgrimage to mecca and thus became a hajji asseed el hage abd salam shabeeny returning from a trading voyage to hamburg he was captured by a ship manned by englishmen but sailing under a russian flag whose captain claimed that his imperial mistress catherine the great was at war with all muselmen see russo turkish war he and the ship he had been sailing in were brought to ostend in belgium in december but the british consul managed to get him and the ship released he set off again in the same ship but the captain who claimed to be afraid of his ship being captured again set him ashore in dover in england his story was recorded shabeeni gave an indication of the size of the city in the second half of the th century in an earlier passage he described an environment that was characterized by forest as opposed to the modern arid surroundings the best known cultural event is the festival au d sert when the tuareg rebellion ended in under the konar administration weapons were burned in a ceremony dubbed the flame of peace on march to commemorate the ceremony a monument was built the festival au d sert to celebrate the peace treaty was held every january in the desert km from the city until the week long festival of mawloud is held every january and celebrates the birthday of muhammed the city s most cherished manuscripts are read publicly and are a central part of this celebration it was originally a shi ite festival from persia and arriving in timbuktu around the most joyful occasion on timbuktu s calendar it combines rituals of sufi islam with celebrating timbuktu s rich literary traditions it is a period of feasting singing and dancing it culminated with an evening gathering of thousands of people in the large sandy square in front of the sankor mosque and a public reading of some of the city s most treasured manuscripts during its twelfth session in december the world heritage committee whc selected parts of timbuktu s historic centre for inscription on its world heritage list the selection was based on three criteria an earlier nomination in failed the following year as it lacked proper demarcation the malian government included the town of timbuktu as a whole in the wish for inclusion close to a decade later three mosques and mausoleums or cemeteries were selected from the old town for world heritage status with this conclusion came the call for protection of the buildings conditions an exclusion of new construction works near the sites and measures against the encroaching sand shortly afterwards the monuments were placed on the list of world heritage in danger by the malian government as by the selection committee at the time of nomination the first period on the danger list lasted from until when a range of measures including restoration work and the compilation of an inventory warranted its removal from the danger list in the whc placed the protected area under increased scrutiny dubbed reinforced monitoring a measure made possible in as the impact of planned construction work was unclear special attention was given to the build of a cultural centre during a session in june unesco decided to cease its increased monitoring program as it felt sufficient progress had been made to address the initial concerns following the takeover of timbuktu by mnla and the islamist group ansar dine it was returned to the list of world heritage in danger in in may ansar dine destroyed a shrine in the city and in june in the aftermath of the battle of gao and timbuktu other shrines including the mausoleum of sidi mahmoud were destroyed when attacked with shovels and pickaxes by members of the same group an ansar dine spokesman said that all shrines in the city including the remaining world heritage sites would be destroyed because they consider them to be examples of idolatry a sin in islam these acts have been described as crimes against humanity and war crimes after the destruction of the tombs unesco created a special fund to safeguard mali s world heritage sites vowing to carry out reconstruction and rehabilitation projects once the security situation allows if the university of sankore had survived the ravages of foreign invasions the academic and cultural history of africa might have been different from what it is today kwame nkrumah at the university of ghana inauguration timbuktu was a world centre of islamic learning from the th to the th century especially under the mali empire and askia mohammad i s rule the malian government and ngos have been working to catalog and restore the remnants of this scholarly legacy timbuktu s manuscripts timbuktu s rapid economic growth in the th and th centuries drew many scholars from nearby walata today in mauritania leading up to the city s golden age in the th and th centuries that proved fertile ground for scholarship of religions arts and sciences to the people of timbuktu literacy and books were symbols of wealth power and blessings and the acquisition of books became a primary concern for scholars an active trade in books between timbuktu and other parts of the islamic world and emperor askia mohammed s strong support led to the writing of thousands of manuscripts knowledge was gathered in a manner similar to the early informal european medieval university model lecturing was presented through a range of informal institutions called madrasahs nowadays known as the university of timbuktu three madrasahs facilitated students djinguereber sidi yahya and sankore these institutions were explicitly religious as opposed to the more secular curricula of modern european universities and more similar to the medieval europe model however where universities in the european sense started as associations of students and teachers west african education was patronized by families or lineages with the aqit and bunu al qadi al hajj families being two of the most prominent in timbuktu these families also facilitated students in set aside rooms in their housings although the basis of islamic law and its teaching were brought to timbuktu from north africa with the spread of islam western african scholarship developed ahmad baba al massufi is regarded as the city s greatest scholar timbuktu served in this process as a distribution centre of scholars and scholarship its reliance on trade meant intensive movement of scholars between the city and its extensive network of trade partners in though many scholars left for walata when sunni ali s songhay empire absorbed timbuktu then in the moroccan invasion of timbuktu scholars had to flee once more or face imprisonment or murder this system of education survived until the late th century while the th century saw the institution of itinerant quranic school as a form of universal education where scholars would travel throughout the region with their students begging for food part of the day islamic education came under pressure after the french occupation droughts in the s and s and by mali s civil war in the early s hundreds of thousands of manuscripts were collected in timbuktu over the course of centuries some were written in the town itself others including exclusive copies of the quran for wealthy families imported through the lively booktrade hidden in cellars or buried hid between the mosque s mud walls and safeguarded by their patrons many of these manuscripts survived the city s decline they now form the collection of several libraries in timbuktu holding up to manuscripts in late january it was reported that rebel forces destroyed many of the manuscripts before leaving the city on friday morning january fifteen jihadis entered the restoration and conservation rooms on the ground floor of the ahmed baba institute in sankor the men swept manuscripts off lab tables and shelves and carried them into the tiled courtyard they doused the manuscripts in gasoline and tossed in a lit match the brittle pages and their dry leather covers were consumed by the inferno however there was no malicious destruction of any library or collection as most of the manuscripts were safely hidden away unreliable source one librarian in particular abdel kader haidara arranged to have medieval manuscripts smuggled out of timbuktu for safekeeping these libraries are the largest among up to private or public libraries that are estimated to exist in timbuktu today although some comprise little more than a row of books on a shelf or a bookchest under these circumstances the manuscripts are vulnerable to damage and theft as well as long term climate damage despite timbuktu s arid climate two timbuktu manuscripts projects funded by independent universities have aimed to preserve them during the occupation by islamic extremists the citizens of the city embarked on a drive to save the best written accounts of african history interviewed by time magazine the local residents claimed to have safeguarded the three hundred thousand manuscripts for generations many of these documents are still in the safe keeping of the local residents who are reluctant to give them over to the government run ahmed baba institute housed in a modern digitalization building built by the south african government in the institute houses only of the manuscripts it was later confirmed by jean michel djian to the new yorker that the great majority of the manuscripts about fifty thousand are actually housed in the thirty two family libraries of the city of saints he added those are to this day protected he also added that due to the massive efforts of one individual two hundred thousand other manuscripts were successfully transported to safety this effort was organized by abdel kader haidara then director of mamma haidara library using his own funds haidara purchased metal footlockers in which up to manuscripts could be securely stored nearly of these lockers were distributed to safe houses across the city many were later moved to dreazen although french is mali s official language today the large majority of timbuktu s inhabitants speaks koyra chiini a songhay language that also functions as the lingua franca before the tuareg rebellion both hassaniya arabic and tamashek were represented by each to an dominance of the koyra chiini language with tamashek spoken by both ikelan and ethnic tuaregs its use declined with the expulsion of many tuaregs following the rebellion increasing the dominance of koyra chiini arabic introduced together with islam during the th century has mainly been the language of scholars and religion comparable to latin in western christianity although bambara is spoken by the most numerous ethnic group in mali the bambara people it is mainly confined to the south of the country with an improving infrastructure granting timbuktu access to larger cities in mali s south use of bambara was increasing in the city at least until azawad independence with no railroads in mali except for the dakar niger railway up to koulikoro access to timbuktu is by road boat or since aircraft with high water levels in the niger from august to december compagnie malienne de navigation comanav passenger ferries operate a leg between koulikoro and downstream gao on a roughly weekly basis also requiring high water are pinasses large motorized pirogues either chartered or public that travel up and down the river both ferries and pinasses arrive at korioum timbuktu s port which is linked to the city centre by an km mi paved road running through kabara in access to timbuktu s traditional port kabara was restored by a libyan funded project that dredged the km mi silted canal connecting kabara to an arm of the niger river comanav ferries and pinasses are now able to reach the port when the river is in full flood timbuktu is poorly connected to the malian road network with only dirt roads to the neighbouring towns although the niger river can be crossed by ferry at korioum the roads south of the river are no better however a new paved road is under construction between niono and timbuktu running to the north of the inland niger delta the km mi road will pass through nampala l r niafunk tonka dir and goundam the completed km mi section between niono and the small village of goma coura was financed by the millennium challenge corporation this new section will service the alatona irrigation system development of the office du niger the km mi section between goma coura and timbuktu is being financed by the european development fund timbuktu airport was served by air mali hosting flights to and from bamako gao and mopti until the airline suspended operations in presently no airlines serve the airport its ft m runway in a runway orientation is both lighted and paved because much of the gold in europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries came from timbuktu the city has long been considered a mysterious hidden place this association remains with modern europeans and north americans a survey of young britons found did not believe the town existed while the other considered it a mythical place this perception has been acknowledged in literature describing african history and african european relations in popular western culture timbuktu is also often considered a faraway place the origin of this mystification lies in the excitement brought to europe by the legendary tales especially those by leo africanus in his description of africa arabic sources focused mainly on more affluent cities in the timbuktu region such as gao and walata in west africa the city holds an image that has been compared to europe s view on athens as such the picture of the city as the epitome of distance and mystery is a european one down to earth aspects in africanus descriptions were largely ignored and stories of great riches served as a catalyst for travellers to visit the inaccessible city with prominent french explorer ren cailli characterising timbuktu as a mass of ill looking houses built of earth now opened up many travellers acknowledged the unfitting description of an african el dorado this development shifted the city s reputation from being fabled because of its gold to fabled because of its location and mystery being used in this sense since at least english dictionaries now cite timbuktu as a metaphor for any faraway place timbuktu is twinned with

 shanghai tower simplified chinese traditional chinese pinyin sh ngh i zh ngx n d sh shanghainese z nhe tsonsin dusa lit shanghai center building is a story meter tall ft megatall skyscraper in lujiazui pudong shanghai it is the tallest building in china and the world s third tallest building by height to architectural top it is the tallest and largest leed platinum certified building in the world since it shares the record along with the ping an finance center of having the world s highest observation deck within a building or structure at m it had the world s second fastest elevators at a top speed of meters per second km h mph until when it was surpassed by the guangzhou ctf finance center with its top speed of meters per second km h mph designed by international design firm gensler and owned by the shanghai municipal government it is the tallest of the world s first triple adjacent supertall buildings in pudong the other two being the jin mao tower and the shanghai world financial center its tiered construction designed for high energy efficiency provides nine separate zones divided between office retail and leisure use construction work on the tower began in november and topped out on august the exterior was completed in summer and work was considered complete in september although the building was originally scheduled to open to the public in november the actual public use date was shifted to february the observation deck was opened to visitors in july the period from july through september was termed a test run or commissioning period since april the sightseeing deck on the th floor has been open to the public planning models for the lujiazui financial district dating back to show plans for a close group of three supertall skyscrapers the first of these the jin mao tower was completed in the adjacent shanghai world financial center swfc opened in the shanghai tower is owned by yeti construction and development a consortium of state owned development companies which includes shanghai chengtou corp shanghai lujiazui finance trade zone development co and shanghai construction group funding for the tower s construction was obtained from shareholders bank loans and shanghai s municipal government the tower had an estimated construction cost of us billion in the site previously a driving range was prepared for construction a groundbreaking ceremony was held on november after the tower had passed an environmental impact study the main construction contractor for the project was shanghai construction group a member of the consortium that owns the tower a repetitive slip forming process was used to construct the tower s core floor by floor by late april the tower s steel reinforcement had risen to the th floor while its concrete core had reached the th floor and floor framing had been completed up to the fourth floor by late december the tower s foundations had been completed and its steel construction had risen above the th floor in the first months of cracks began appearing in the roads near the tower s construction site these were blamed on ground subsidence which was likely caused by excessive groundwater extraction in the shanghai area rather than by the weight of the shanghai tower by may the tower s core stood meters ft high while floors had been framed to a height of meters ft by early september the core had reached a height of meters ft by the end of the tower had reached the th floor standing approximately meters ft tall by april the tower had reached stories standing over meters ft tall and thusly exceeding the heights of its two adjacent supertall skyscrapers the jin mao tower and the shanghai world financial center construction crews laid the final structural beam of the tower on august thus topping out the tower as china s tallest and the world s second tallest building a topping out ceremony was held at the site of the last beam during the ceremony gensler co founder art gensler stated the shanghai tower represents a new way of defining and creating cities by incorporating best practices in sustainability and high performance design by weaving the building into the urban fabric of shanghai and drawing community life into the building shanghai tower redefines the role of tall buildings in contemporary cities and raises the bar for the next generation of super highrises the principal architect of the project jun xia said with the topping out of shanghai tower the lujiazui trio will serve as a stunning representation of our past our present and china s boundless future gu jianping general manager of the shanghai tower construction company expressed the firm s wish to provide higher quality office and shopping space as well as contribute to the completeness of the city skyline s and the entire region s functionality in january the tower s crown structure passed the meter ft mark when its construction entered its final phase the tower s crown structure was completed in august and its fa ade was completed shortly after the tower s interior construction and electrical fitting out were completed in late the opening was gradually introduced during the summer of until june the tower faced problems attracting tenants due to the absence of all the necessary permits from the local fire department and consequent impossibility of obtaining the official occupancy permit following a report in june approximately of its office space has been leased but only of those tenants have moved in leaving entire floors of the tower empty the luxury j hotel has also yet to open the tower s floor plate has an efficiency rate of only per cent on some floors compared with per cent for a typical skyscraper as the tower s much talked about outer skin which is ideal for allowing in natural light and cuts down on air conditioning costs means much of the floor space can t be used as of floors stood empty current tenants of the tower include alibaba intesa sanpaolo and allbright law offices in major water leaks broke out from the th to the th floor of the tower which damaged a large quantity of office equipment and electronics the tower said the problem was fixed and a comprehensive inspection would be taken on the floor where the leak originated some chinese social media users criticized the leakage as typical of the results of tofu dreg projects according to the local newspaper of shanghai misinformation videos circulating online showing that the tower s ceiling was collapsed were in fact from a shopping center in nanning in on june the j hotel shanghai tower opened the shanghai tower was designed by the american architectural firm gensler with shanghainese architect jun xia leading the design team the tower takes the form of nine cylindrical buildings stacked atop each other that total floors all enclosed by the inner layer of the glass facade between that and the outer layer which twists as it rises nine indoor zones provide public space for visitors each of these nine areas has its own atrium featuring gardens caf s restaurants and retail space and providing panoramic views of the city both layers of the fa ade are transparent and retail and event spaces are provided at the tower s base the transparent fa ade is a unique design feature because most buildings have only a single fa ade using highly reflective glass to reduce heat absorption but the shanghai tower s double layer of glass eliminates the need for either layer to be opaqued the tower can accommodate as many as people daily the shanghai tower joins the jin mao tower and swfc to form the world s first adjacent grouping of three supertall buildings its room hotel the j hotel shanghai tower located between the th and th floors is operated by jin jiang international hotels and is the highest hotel in the world the tower will also incorporate a museum the tower s sub levels provide parking spaces for vehicles the vertical transportation system of shanghai tower was designed by an american consultant edgett williams consulting group with principal steve edgett as a primary consultant working closely with gensler s design and technical teams to create a highly efficient core edgett created an elevator system in which office floors are served via sky lobbies each served by double deck shuttle elevators access to the hotel is through a th sky lobby at levels each level sky lobby serves as a community center for that zone of the building with such amenities as food and beverage and conference rooms local zones are served by single deck elevators throughout the tower and the observation deck at the top of the tower is served by three ultra high speed shuttle elevators that travel at meters per second mph the highest speed yet employed for commercial building use these three shuttle elevators are supplemented by three fireman s elevators which will significantly increase the visitor throughput to the observation deck at peak usage periods in the event of a fire or other emergency the building s shuttle elevators are designed to evacuate occupants from specially designed refuge floors located at regular intervals throughout the height of the tower in september mitsubishi electric announced that it had won a bid to construct the shanghai tower s elevator system mitsubishi supplied all of the tower s elevators including three high speed models capable of traveling meters ft per minute kilometers mi per hour when they were installed they were the world s fastest single deck elevators meters per second mph and double deck elevators meters per second mph respectively a may mitsubishi press release stated that one of the three installed shuttle elevators traveled at meters minute the equivalent of kilometers per hour mph the highest speed ever attained by a passenger elevator installed in a functioning building the building also broke the record for the world s furthest traveling single elevator at meters ft surpassing the record held by the burj khalifa the shanghai tower s tuned mass damper designed to limit swaying at the top of the structure was the world s largest at the time of its installation the shanghai tower comprises numerous green architecture components its owners received certifications from the china green building committee and the u s green building council for the building s sustainable design in a gensler spokesman recounted the tower as the greenest super high rise building on earth at this point in time the building is designed to catch rainwater for internal use and to reuse a portion of its wastewater the design of the tower s glass fa ade which completes a twist as it rises is intended to reduce wind loads on the building by this reduced the amount of construction materials needed the shanghai tower used less structural steel than a conventional design of a similar height as a result the building s constructors saved an estimated us million in material costs construction practices were also sustainable though the majority of the tower s energy will be provided by conventional power systems vertical axis wind turbines located in the facade and near the top of the tower are capable of generating up to kwh of supplementary electricity per year and are expected to provide of the building s electrical needs the double layered insulating glass fa ade was designed to reduce the need for indoor air conditioning and is composed of an advanced reinforced glass with a high tolerance for temperature variations in addition the building s heating and cooling systems use geothermal energy sources furthermore rain and waste water are recycled to flush toilets and irrigate the tower s green spaces note floor g or is skipped

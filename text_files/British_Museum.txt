 coordinates n w n w the british museum is a public museum dedicated to human history art and culture located in the bloomsbury area of london its permanent collection of eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence it documents the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present a the british museum was the first public national museum to cover all fields of knowledge the museum was established in largely based on the collections of the anglo irish physician and scientist sir hans sloane it first opened to the public in in montagu house on the site of the current building the museum s expansion over the following years was largely a result of british colonisation and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions or independent spin offs the first being the natural history museum in in the british library act detached the library department from the british museum but it continued to host the now separated british library in the same reading room and building as the museum until the museum is a non departmental public body sponsored by the department for digital culture media and sport and as with all national museums in the uk it charges no admission fee except for loan exhibitions its ownership of a small percentage of its most famous objects originating in other countries is disputed and remains the subject of international controversy through repatriation claims most notably in the case of the elgin marbles of greece and the rosetta stone of egypt although today principally a museum of cultural art objects and antiquities the british museum was founded as a universal museum its foundations lie in the will of the anglo irish physician and naturalist sir hans sloane a london based doctor and scientist from ulster during the course of his lifetime and particularly after he married the widow of a wealthy jamaican planter sloane gathered a large collection of curiosities and not wishing to see his collection broken up after death he bequeathed it to king george ii for the nation for a sum of at that time sloane s collection consisted of around objects of all kinds including some printed books manuscripts extensive natural history specimens including volumes of dried plants prints and drawings including those by albrecht d rer and antiquities from sudan egypt greece rome the ancient near and far east and the americas on june king george ii gave his royal assent to the act of parliament which established the british museum b the british museum act also added two other libraries to the sloane collection namely the cottonian library assembled by sir robert cotton dating back to elizabethan times and the harleian library the collection of the earls of oxford they were joined in by the old royal library now the royal manuscripts assembled by various british monarchs together these four foundation collections included many of the most treasured books now in the british library including the lindisfarne gospels and the sole surviving manuscript of beowulf c the british museum was the first of a new kind of museum national belonging to neither church nor king freely open to the public and aiming to collect everything sloane s collection while including a vast miscellany of objects tended to reflect his scientific interests the addition of the cotton and harley manuscripts introduced a literary and antiquarian element and meant that the british museum now became both national museum and library the body of trustees decided on a converted th century mansion montagu house as a location for the museum which it bought from the montagu family for the trustees rejected buckingham house which was later converted into the present day buckingham palace on the grounds of cost and the unsuitability of its location d with the acquisition of montagu house the first exhibition galleries and reading room for scholars opened on january at this time the largest parts of collection were the library which took up the majority of the rooms on the ground floor of montagu house and the natural history objects which took up an entire wing on the second state storey of the building in the trustees of the british museum under the influence of peter collinson and william watson employed the former student of carl linnaeus daniel solander to reclassify the natural history collection according to the linnaean system thereby making the museum a public centre of learning accessible to the full range of european natural historians in king george iv gave the king s library assembled by george iii and parliament gave the right to a copy of every book published in the country thereby ensuring that the museum s library would expand indefinitely during the few years after its foundation the british museum received several further gifts including the thomason collection of civil war tracts and david garrick s library of printed plays the predominance of natural history books and manuscripts began to lessen when in the museum acquired for its first significant antiquities in sir william hamilton s first collection of greek vases from a display of objects from the south seas brought back from the round the world voyages of captain james cook and the travels of other explorers fascinated visitors with a glimpse of previously unknown lands the bequest of a collection of books engraved gems coins prints and drawings by clayton mordaunt cracherode in did much to raise the museum s reputation but montagu house became increasingly crowded and decrepit and it was apparent that it would be unable to cope with further expansion the museum s first notable addition towards its collection of antiquities since its foundation was by sir william hamilton british ambassador to naples who sold his collection of greek and roman artefacts to the museum in together with a number of other antiquities and natural history specimens a list of donations to the museum dated january refers to the hamilton bequest of a colossal foot of an apollo in marble it was one of two antiquities of hamilton s collection drawn for him by francesco progenie a pupil of pietro fabris who also contributed a number of drawings of mount vesuvius sent by hamilton to the royal society in london in the early th century the foundations for the extensive collection of sculpture began to be laid and greek roman and egyptian artefacts dominated the antiquities displays after the defeat of the french campaign in the battle of the nile in the british museum acquired more egyptian sculptures and in king george iii presented the rosetta stone key to the deciphering of hieroglyphs gifts and purchases from henry salt british consul general in egypt beginning with the colossal bust of ramesses ii in laid the foundations of the collection of egyptian monumental sculpture many greek sculptures followed notably the first purpose built exhibition space the charles towneley collection much of it roman sculpture in in thomas bruce th earl of elgin ambassador to the ottoman empire from to removed the large collection of marble sculptures from the parthenon on the acropolis in athens and transferred them to the uk in these masterpieces of western art were acquired by the british museum by act of parliament and deposited in the museum thereafter the collections were supplemented by the bassae frieze from phigaleia greece in the ancient near eastern collection also had its beginnings in with the purchase of assyrian and babylonian antiquities from the widow of claudius james rich in a buildings committee was set up to plan for expansion of the museum and further highlighted by the donation in of the king s library personal library of king george iii s comprising volumes pamphlets maps charts and topographical drawings the neoclassical architect sir robert smirke was asked to draw up plans for an eastern extension to the museum for the reception of the royal library and a picture gallery over it and put forward plans for today s quadrangular building much of which can be seen today the dilapidated old montagu house was demolished and work on the king s library gallery began in the extension the east wing was completed by however following the founding of the national gallery london in e the proposed picture gallery was no longer needed and the space on the upper floor was given over to the natural history collections the first synopsis of the british museum was published in this described the contents of the museum and the display of objects room by room and updated editions were published every few years as sir robert smirke s grand neo classical building gradually arose the museum became a construction site the king s library on the ground floor of the east wing was handed over in and was described as one of the finest rooms in london although it was not fully open to the general public until special openings were arranged during the great exhibition of in the museum became involved in its first overseas excavations charles fellows s expedition to xanthos in asia minor whence came remains of the tombs of the rulers of ancient lycia among them the nereid and payava monuments in charles newton was to discover the th century bc mausoleum of halikarnassos one of the seven wonders of the ancient world in the s and s the museum supported excavations in assyria by a h layard and others at sites such as nimrud and nineveh of particular interest to curators was the eventual discovery of ashurbanipal s great library of cuneiform tablets which helped to make the museum a focus for assyrian studies sir thomas grenville a trustee of the british museum from assembled a library of volumes which he left to the museum in his will the books arrived in january in twenty one horse drawn vans the only vacant space for this large library was a room originally intended for manuscripts between the front entrance hall and the manuscript saloon the books remained here until the british library moved to st pancras in the opening of the forecourt in marked the completion of robert smirke s plan but already adjustments were having to be made to cope with the unforeseen growth of the collections infill galleries were constructed for assyrian sculptures and sydney smirke s round reading room with space for a million books opened in because of continued pressure on space the decision was taken to move natural history to a new building in south kensington which would later become the british museum of natural history roughly contemporary with the construction of the new building was the career of a man sometimes called the second founder of the british museum the italian librarian anthony panizzi under his supervision the british museum library now part of the british library quintupled in size and became a well organised institution worthy of being called a national library the largest library in the world after the national library of paris the quadrangle at the centre of smirke s design proved to be a waste of valuable space and was filled at panizzi s request by a circular reading room of cast iron designed by smirke s brother sydney smirke until the mid th century the museum s collections were relatively circumscribed but in with the appointment to the staff of augustus wollaston franks to curate the collections the museum began for the first time to collect british and european medieval antiquities prehistory branching out into asia and diversifying its holdings of ethnography a real coup for the museum was the purchase in over french objections of the duke of blacas s wide ranging and valuable collection of antiquities overseas excavations continued and john turtle wood discovered the remains of the th century bc temple of artemis at ephesos another wonder of the ancient world the natural history collections were an integral part of the british museum until their removal to the new british museum of natural history in nowadays the natural history museum with the departure and the completion of the new white wing fronting montague street in more space was available for antiquities and ethnography and the library could further expand this was a time of innovation as electric lighting was introduced in the reading room and exhibition galleries the william burges collection of armoury was bequeathed to the museum in in the museum was involved in the establishment of the independent egypt exploration fund now society the first british body to carry out research in egypt a bequest from miss emma turner in financed excavations in cyprus in the death of the great collector and curator a w franks was followed by an immense bequest of finger rings drinking vessels pieces of continental porcelain netsuke inro over bookplates and miscellaneous items of jewellery and plate among them the oxus treasure in baron ferdinand de rothschild bequeathed the waddesdon bequest the glittering contents from his new smoking room at waddesdon manor this consisted of almost pieces of objets d art et de vertu which included exquisite examples of jewellery plate enamel carvings glass and maiolica among them the holy thorn reliquary probably created in the s in paris for john duke of berry the collection was in the tradition of a schatzkammer such as those formed by the renaissance princes of europe baron ferdinand s will was most specific and failure to observe the terms would make it void the collection should be placed in a special room to be called the waddesdon bequest room separate and apart from the other contents of the museum and thenceforth for ever thereafter keep the same in such room or in some other room to be substituted for it these terms are still observed and the collection occupies room a by the last years of the th century the british museum s collections had increased to the extent that its building was no longer large enough in the trustees purchased the houses surrounding the museum with the intention of demolishing them and building around the west north and east sides of the museum the first stage was the construction of the northern wing beginning all the while the collections kept growing emil torday collected in central africa aurel stein in central asia d g hogarth leonard woolley and t e lawrence excavated at carchemish around this time the american collector and philanthropist j pierpont morgan donated a substantial number of objects to the museum including william greenwell s collection of prehistoric artefacts from across europe which he had purchased for in morgan had also acquired a major part of sir john evans s coin collection which was later sold to the museum by his son john pierpont morgan junior in in because of the threat of wartime bombing some objects were evacuated via the london post office railway to holborn the national library of wales aberystwyth and a country house near malvern on the return of antiquities from wartime storage in some objects were found to have deteriorated a conservation laboratory was set up in may and became a permanent department in it is today the oldest in continuous existence in the british museum welcomed over one million visitors new mezzanine floors were constructed and book stacks rebuilt in an attempt to cope with the flood of books in the art dealer sir joseph duveen offered funds to build a gallery for the parthenon sculptures designed by the american architect john russell pope it was completed in the appearance of the exhibition galleries began to change as dark victorian reds gave way to modern pastel shades f following the retirement of george francis hill as director and principal librarian in he was succeeded by john forsdyke as tensions with nazi germany developed and it appeared that war may be imminent forsdyke came to the view that with the likelihood of far worse air raids than that experienced in world war i that the museum had to make preparations to remove its most valuable items to secure locations following the munich crisis forsdyke ordered no nail boxes and stored them in the basement of duveen gallery at the same time he began identifying and securing suitable locations as a result the museum was able to quickly commence relocating selected items on august a mere day after the home secretary advised them to do so to secure basements country houses aldwych underground station and the national library of wales many items were relocated in early from their initial dispersal locations to a newly developed facility at westwood quarry in wiltshire the evacuation was timely for in the duveen gallery was severely damaged by bombing meanwhile prior to the war the nazis had sent a researcher to the british museum for several years with the aim of compiling an anti semitic history of anglo jewry after the war the museum continued to collect from all countries and all centuries among the most spectacular additions were the bc mesopotamian treasure from ur discovered during leonard woolley s excavations gold silver and garnet grave goods from the anglo saxon ship burial at sutton hoo and late roman silver tableware from mildenhall suffolk the immediate post war years were taken up with the return of the collections from protection and the restoration of the museum after the blitz work also began on restoring the damaged duveen gallery in the museum celebrated its bicentenary many changes followed the first full time in house designer and publications officer were appointed in the friends organisation was set up in an education service established in and publishing house in in a new act of parliament introduced administrative reforms it became easier to lend objects the constitution of the board of trustees changed and the natural history museum became fully independent by the coins and medals office suite completely destroyed during the war was rebuilt and re opened attention turned towards the gallery work with new tastes in design leading to the remodelling of robert smirke s classical and near eastern galleries in the duveen gallery was finally restored and the parthenon sculptures were moved back into it once again at the heart of the museum g by the s the museum was again expanding more services for the public were introduced visitor numbers soared with the temporary exhibition treasures of tutankhamun in attracting visitors the most successful in british history in the same year the act of parliament establishing the british library was passed separating the collection of manuscripts and printed books from the british museum this left the museum with antiquities coins medals and paper money prints and drawings and ethnography a pressing problem was finding space for additions to the library which now required an extra miles km of shelving each year the government suggested a site at st pancras for the new british library but the books did not leave the museum until the departure of the british library to a new site at st pancras finally achieved in provided the space needed for the books it also created the opportunity to redevelop the vacant space in robert smirke s th century central quadrangle into the queen elizabeth ii great court the largest covered square in europe which opened in the ethnography collections which had been housed in the short lived museum of mankind at burlington gardens from were returned to new purpose built galleries in the museum in the museum again readjusted its collecting policies as interest in modern objects prints drawings medals and the decorative arts reawakened ethnographical fieldwork was carried out in places as diverse as new guinea madagascar romania guatemala and indonesia and there were excavations in the near east egypt sudan and the uk the weston gallery of roman britain opened in displayed a number of recently discovered hoards which demonstrated the richness of what had been considered an unimportant part of the roman empire the museum turned increasingly towards private funds for buildings acquisitions and other purposes today the museum no longer houses collections of natural history and the books and manuscripts it once held now form part of the independent british library the museum nevertheless preserves its universality in its collections of artefacts representing the cultures of the world ancient and modern the original collection has grown to over million objects at the british museum million at the natural history museum and million at the british library the round reading room which was designed by the architect sydney smirke opened in for almost years researchers came here to consult the museum s vast library the reading room closed in when the national library the british library moved to a new building at st pancras today it has been transformed into the walter and leonore annenberg centre with the bookstacks in the central courtyard of the museum empty the demolition for lord foster s glass roofed great court could begin the great court opened in

was the round reading room at feet m in diameter it was then the second widest dome in the world the pantheon in rome being slightly wider the next major addition was the white wing added behind the eastern end of the south front the architect being sir john taylor in parliament gave the museum trustees a loan of to purchase from the duke of bedford all houses which backed onto the museum building in the five surrounding streets great russell street montague street montague place bedford square and bloomsbury street the trustees planned to demolish these houses and to build around the west north and east sides of the museum new galleries that would completely fill the block on which the museum stands the architect sir john james burnet was petitioned to put forward ambitious long term plans to extend the building on all three sides most of the houses in montague place were knocked down a few years after the sale of this grand plan only the edward vii galleries in the centre of the north front were ever constructed these were built to the design by j j burnet and opened by king george v and queen mary in they now house the museum s collections of prints and drawings and oriental antiquities there was not enough money to put up more new buildings and so the houses in the other streets are nearly all still standing the duveen gallery sited to the west of the egyptian greek assyrian sculpture galleries was designed to house the elgin marbles by the american beaux arts architect john russell pope although completed in it was hit by a bomb in and remained semi

on public display less than of its entire collection approximately items there are nearly one hundred galleries open to the public representing miles km of exhibition space although the less popular ones have restricted opening times however the lack of a large temporary exhibition space led to the million world conservation and exhibitions centre to provide one and to concentrate all the museum

breeks sir alexander cunningham sir harold deane sir walter elliot james prinsep charles masson sir john marshall and charles stuart a large number of chinese antiquities were purchased from the anglo greek banker george eumorfopoulos in the s the large collection of some japanese prints and paintings owned by arthur morrison was acquired in the early twentieth century in the second half of the twentieth century the museum greatly benefited from the bequest of the philanthropist pt brooke sewell which allowed the department to purchase many objects and fill in gaps in the collection in the ethnographic collections from asia were transferred to the department these reflect the diverse environment of the largest continent in the world and range from india to china the middle east to japan much of the ethnographic material comes from objects originally owned by tribal cultures and hunter gatherers many of whose way of life has disappeared in the last century particularly valuable collections are from the andaman and nicobar islands much assembled by the british naval officer maurice portman sri lanka especially through the colonial administrator hugh nevill northern thailand south west china the ainu of hokaidu in japan chief among them the collection of the scottish zoologist john anderson siberia with artefacts collected by the explorer kate marsden and bassett digby

british museum s oceanic collections originate from the vast area of the pacific ocean stretching from papua new guinea to easter island from new zealand to hawaii the three main anthropological groups represented in the collection are polynesia melanesia and micronesia aboriginal art from australia is considered separately in its own right metal working was not indigenous to oceania before europeans arrived so many of the artefacts from the collection are made from stone shell bone and bamboo prehistoric objects from the region include a bird shaped pestle and a group of stone mortars from papua new guinea the british museum is fortunate in having some of the earliest oceanic and pacific collections many of which were put together by members of cook s and vancouver s expeditions or by colonial administrators and explorers such as sir george grey sir frederick broome joseph bradshaw robert christison gregory mathews frederick meinertzhagen thomas mitchell and arthur gordon before western culture significantly impacted on indigenous cultures the department has also benefited greatly from the legacy of pioneering anthropologists such as ac haddon bronis aw malinowski and katherine routledge a poignant artefact is the wooden aboriginal shield probably dating from the late eighteenth century there is some debate as to whether this shield was found at botany bay or given the nature of the wood being red mangrove which grows abundantly only km north of botany bay possibly obtained through trade networks or at an entirely different location the wilson cabinet of curiosities from palau is an example of pre contact ware another outstanding exemplar is the mourner s dress from tahiti given to cook on his second voyage one of only ten in existence in the collection is a large war canoe from the island of vella lavella in the solomon islands one of the last ever to be built in the archipelago in addition the m ori collection is the finest outside new

kayung totem pole which was made in the late nineteenth century on haida gwaii dominates the great court and provides a fitting introduction to this very wide ranging collection that stretches from the very north of the north american continent where the inuit population has lived for centuries to the tip of south america where indigenous tribes have long thrived in patagonia highlights of the

continues to develop techniques to date artefacts analyse and identify the materials used in their manufacture to identify the place an artefact originated and the techniques used in their creation the department also publishes its findings and discoveries this department covers all levels of education from casual visitors schools degree level and beyond the museum s various libraries hold in excess of books journals and pamphlets covering all areas of the museum s collection also the general museum archives which date from its foundation in are overseen by this department the individual departments have their own separate archives and libraries covering their various areas of responsibility which can be consulted by the public on application the anthropology library is especially large with volumes however the paul hamlyn library which had become the central reference library of the british museum and the only library there freely open to the general public closed permanently in august the website and online database of the collection also provide increasing amounts of information the british museum press bmp is the publishing business and a division of the british museum company ltd a company and a charity established in wholly owned by the trustees of the british museum the bmp publishes both popular and scholarly illustrated books to accompany the exhibition programme and explore aspects of the general collection profits from their sales goes to support the british museum scholarly titles are published in the research publications series all of which are peer reviewed this series was started in and was originally called occasional papers the series is designed to disseminate research on items in the collection between six and eight titles are published each year in this series it is a point of controversy whether museums should be allowed to possess artefacts taken from other countries and the british museum is a notable target for criticism the elgin marbles benin bronzes ethiopian tabots and the rosetta stone are among the most disputed objects in its collections and organisations have been formed demanding the return of these artefacts to their native countries the parthenon marbles elgin marbles claimed by greece were also cited by unesco among others for restitution from to elgin s agents removed about half of the surviving sculptures from the parthenon as well as sculptures from the propylaea and erechtheum the former director of the museum has stated we are indebted to elgin for having rescued the parthenon sculptures and others from the acropolis from the destruction they were suffering as well as from the damage that the acropolis monuments including the sculptures that he did not remove have suffered since there is also controversy over artefacts taken during the destruction of the old summer palace in beijing by an anglo french expeditionary force during the second opium war in an event which drew a protest from victor hugo the british museum and the victoria and albert museum among others have been asked since to open their archives for investigation by a team of chinese investigators as a part of an international mission to document chinese national treasures in foreign collections in neil macgregor the former director of the british museum said he hoped that both british and chinese investigators would work together on the controversial collection in the museum appointed a curator to research the history of its collections including disputed items the british museum has stated that the restitutionist premise that whatever was made in a country must return to an original geographical site would empty both the british museum and the other great museums of the world the museum has also argued that the british museum act of prevents any object from leaving its collection once it has entered it the museum owns its collections but its trustees are not empowered to dispose of them nevertheless it has returned items such as tasmanian aboriginal burial remains when this was consistent with legislation regarding the disposal of items in the collections in recent years there have been several protests against the british museum s relationship with the oil company bp in may the british museum was temporarily closed after a greenpeace protest in february hundreds of people occupied the museum in protest against the bp sponsorship in july ahdaf soueif resigned from the british museum s board of trustees in protest against the sponsorship in february demonstrators including british museum staff took part in a day of protest over the issue occupying of the museum s rooms the pcs union said the museum had a duty to recognise the escalating climate crisis and cut its ties with bp in reply the museum said we are aware of the comments from the pcs union and will continue to liaise with the british museum pcs branch and our staff more generally the chairman s advisory group is an informal group of business leaders who provide advice to the chairman on various issues including the museum s relationship with the british government and policy on the museum s collections its existence was made public after a freedom of information request by a group campaigning against the museum s links with the fossil fuel industry the museum has declined to name the

that is one of the five pillars of islam the old elgin gallery was painted a deep terracotta red which though in some ways satisfactory diminished its apparent size and was apt to produce a depressing effect on the visitor it was decided to experiment with lighter colours and the walls of the large room were painted with what was at its first application a pure cold white but which after a year s exposure had unfortunately yellowed the small elgin room was painted with pure white tinted with prussian blue and the room of the metopes was painted with pure white tinted with cobalt blue and black it was necessary for practical reasons to colour all the dadoes a darker colour it is i suppose not positively bad but it could have been infinitely better it is pretentious in that it uses the ancient marbles to decorate itself this is a long outmoded idea and the exact opposite of what a sculpture gallery should do and although it incorporates them it is out of scale and tends to dwarf them with its bogus doric features including those columns supporting almost nothing which would have made an ancient greek artist architect wince the source of daylight is too high above the sculptures a fault that is only concealed by the amount of reflection from the pinkish marble walls these are too similar in colour to the marbles these half dozen elementary errors were pointed out by everyone in the museum and by many scholars outside when the building was projected

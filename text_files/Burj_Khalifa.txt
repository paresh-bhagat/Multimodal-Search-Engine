 coordinates n e n e the burj khalifa b rd k li f arabic arabic pronunciation b rd xa li fa khalifa tower known as the burj dubai prior to its inauguration in is a skyscraper in dubai united arab emirates it is known for being the world s tallest building with a total height of m ft or just over half a mile and a roof height excluding antenna but including a m spire of m ft the burj khalifa has been the tallest structure and building in the world since its topping out in supplanting taipei the previous holder of that status construction of the burj khalifa began in with the exterior completed five years later in the primary structure is reinforced concrete and some of the structural steel for the building originated from the palace of the republic in east berlin the former east german parliament the building was opened in as part of a new development called downtown dubai it was designed to be the centerpiece of large scale mixed use development the decision to construct the building was based on the government s decision to diversify from an oil based economy and for dubai to gain international recognition citation needed the building is named in honor of the former president of the united arab emirates khalifa bin zayed al nahyan abu dhabi and the uae government lent dubai money to pay its debts the building broke numerous height records including its designation as the tallest building in the world burj khalifa was designed by a team led by adrian smith of skidmore owings merrill the firm that designed the sears tower in chicago a previous record holder for the world s tallest building hyder consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with norr group consultants international limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project the design is derived from the islamic architecture of the region such as in the great mosque of samarra the y shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space a buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building although this design was derived from tower palace iii the burj khalifa s central core houses all vertical transportation except egress stairs within each of the wings the structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand dubai s hot summer temperatures it contains a total of elevators and escalators at a certain point in the architectural and engineering process the original emaar developers experienced financial problems and required more money and economic funding sheikh khalifa the then ruler of the united arab emirates granted monetary aid and funding hence the changing of the name from burj dubai to burj khalifa the concept of profitability derived from building high density developments and malls around the landmark has proven successful its surrounding malls hotels and condominiums in downtown dubai have generated the most revenue from the project as a whole while the burj khalifa itself made little or no profit the critical reception of burj khalifa has been generally positive and the building has received many awards however there were numerous complaints concerning migrant workers from south asia who were the primary building labour force these centered on low wages and the practice of confiscating passports until duties were complete construction began on january with the exterior of the structure completed on october the building officially opened on january and is part of the km acre downtown dubai development at the first interchange along sheikh zayed road near dubai s main business district the tower s architecture and engineering were performed by skidmore owings merrill of chicago with adrian smith as chief architect and bill baker as a chief structural engineer the primary contractor was samsung c t of south korea together with local company arabtec and the belgian group besix burj khalifa was designed to be the centerpiece of a large scale mixed use development to include homes citation needed nine hotels including the address downtown dubai hectares acres of parkland at least residential skyscrapers the dubai mall and the hectare acre artificial burj khalifa lake the decision to build burj khalifa was reportedly based on the government s decision to diversify from an oil based economy to one that is service and tourism based according to officials projects like burj khalifa needed to be built to garner more international recognition and hence investment he sheikh mohammed bin rashid al maktoum wanted to put dubai on the map with something really sensational said jacqui josephson a tourism and vip delegations executive at nakheel properties the tower was known as burj dubai dubai tower until its official opening in january it was renamed in honour of the ruler of abu dhabi khalifa bin zayed al nahyan abu dhabi and the federal government of uae lent dubai tens of billions of us dollars so that dubai could pay its debts dubai borrowed at least billion for construction projects in the s dubai started diversifying its economy but it suffered from an economic crisis in leaving large scale projects already in construction abandoned the burj khalifa set several world records including there are unconfirmed reports of several planned height increases since its inception originally proposed as a virtual clone of the m ft grollo tower proposal for melbourne australia s docklands waterfront development the tower was redesigned by skidmore owings and merrill marshall strabala a skidmore owings and merrill architect who worked on the project until said in late that burj khalifa was designed to be m ft tall the architect who designed it adrian smith felt that the uppermost section of the building did not culminate elegantly with the rest of the structure so he sought and received approval to increase its height citation needed it was stated that this change did not add any floors which fit with smith s attempts to make the crown more slender the building opened on january the tower was designed by skidmore owings and merrill som which also designed the willis tower formerly the sears tower in chicago and the one world trade center in new york city burj khalifa uses the bundled tube design of the willis tower invented by fazlur rahman khan due to its tubular system proportionally only half the amount of steel was used in the construction compared to the empire state building khan s contributions to the design of tall buildings have had a profound impact on architecture and engineering it would be difficult to find any worldwide practices in the design of tall buildings that have not been directly or indirectly influenced by his work the design is reminiscent of frank lloyd wright s vision for the illinois a mile high skyscraper designed for chicago as well as chicago s lake point tower when adrian smith was conceiving the project at som he looked out his office window toward lake point tower s curved three wing layout and thought there s the prototype according to strabala burj khalifa was designed based on the floor tower palace three an all residential building in seoul in its early planning burj khalifa was intended to be entirely residential after the original design by skidmore owings and merrill emaar properties chose hyder consulting to be the supervising engineer and norr group consultants international ltd to supervise the architecture of the project hyder was selected for their expertise in structural and mep mechanical electrical and plumbing engineering hyder consulting s role was to supervise construction certify the architect s design and be the engineer and architect of record to the uae authorities norr s role was the supervision of all architectural components including on site supervision during the construction and design of a story addition to the office annex building for architectural documentation norr was also responsible for the architectural integration drawings for the armani hotel included in the tower emaar properties also engaged ghd an international multidisciplinary consulting firm to act as an independent verification and testing authority for concrete and steelwork the design is derived from islamic architecture as the tower rises from the flat desert base there are setbacks in a spiral pattern decreasing the cross section of the tower as it rises and creating convenient outdoor terraces these setbacks are arranged and aligned in a way that minimizes vibration wind loading from eddy currents and vortices at the top the central core emerges and is sculpted to form a finishing spire at its tallest point the tower sways a total of m ft the spire of burj khalifa is composed of more than tonnes short tons long tons of structural steel the central pinnacle pipe weighs tonnes short tons long tons and has a height of m ft the spire also houses communications equipment this metre ft spire is widely considered vanity height since very little of its space is usable without the spire burj khalifa would be metres ft tall this was reported in a council on tall buildings and urban habitat study which notes that the empty spire could be a skyscraper on its own such a skyscraper if located in europe would be the th tallest building on that continent in architects announced that more than pieces of art would adorn the interiors of burj khalifa while the residential lobby of burj khalifa would display the work of jaume plensa the cladding system consists of m sq ft of more than reflective glass panels and aluminium and textured stainless steel spandrel panels with vertical tubular fins the architectural glass provides solar and thermal performance as well as an anti glare shield for the intense desert sun extreme desert temperatures and strong winds the glass covers more than m sq ft in area citation needed the burj s typical curtain wall panels measure ft in m wide by ft in m high and weigh about pounds kg each with wider panels near the building s edges and taller ones near the top the exterior temperature at the top of the building is thought to be c f cooler than at its base needs update a room armani hotel the first of four by armani occupies of the lower floors the hotel was supposed to open on march but after several delays it finally opened to the public on april the corporate suites and offices were also supposed to open from march onwards yet the hotel and observation deck remained the only parts of the building which were open in april the sky lobbies on the rd and th floors house swimming pools floors through have private residential apartments which according to the developer sold out within eight hours of being on the market an outdoor zero entry swimming pool is located on the th floor of the tower corporate offices and suites fill most of the remaining floors except for the nd rd and th where the at mosphere restaurant sky lobby and an indoor and outdoor observation deck are located respectively in january it was planned that burj khalifa would receive its first residents in february the building has elevators and escalators the elevators have a capacity of to people per cabin the fastest rising and descending at up to m s ft s for double deck elevators however the world s fastest single deck elevator still belongs to taipei at m s ft s engineers had considered installing the world s first triple deck elevators but the final design called for double deck elevators the double deck elevators are equipped with entertainment features such as lcd displays to serve visitors during their travel to the observation deck the building has stairs from the ground floor to the th floor the burj khalifa s water system supplies an average of l u s gal of water per day through km mi of pipes an additional km mi of piping serves the fire emergency system and km mi supplies chilled water for the air conditioning system the air conditioning system draws air from the upper floors where the air is cooler and cleaner than on the ground at peak cooling times the tower s cooling is mw hp equivalent to that provided by short tons lb kg of melting ice in one day water is collected via a condensate collection system and is used to irrigate the nearby park to wash the windows totaling m sq ft of glass the building has three horizontal tracks each holding a kg lb bucket machine above level and up to tier traditional cradles from davits are used the top of the building is cleaned by a crew that uses ropes to descend from the top to gain access under normal conditions when all building maintenance units are operational it takes workers three to four months to clean the entire exterior unmanned machines clean the top additional tiers and the glass spire the cleaning system was developed in melbourne australia by coxgomyl a manufacturer of building maintenance units at a cost of a million outside the burj khalifa wet enterprises designed a fountain system at a cost of dh million us million illuminated by lights and coloured projectors it is m ft long and shoots water m ft into the air while accompanied by a range of classical to contemporary arabic and other music it is the world s largest choreographed fountain on october emaar announced that based on results of a naming contest the fountain would be called the dubai fountain an outdoor observation deck named at the top opened on january on the th floor at m ft it was the highest outdoor observation deck in the world when it opened although it was surpassed in december by cloud top on the canton tower guangzhou at m ft burj khalifa opened the th floor sky level at m ft once again giving it the highest observation deck in the world on october until the shanghai tower opened in june with an observation deck at a height of metres the th floor observation deck also features the electronic telescope an augmented reality device developed by gsmprjct of montr al which allows visitors to view the surrounding landscape in real time and to view previously saved images such as those taken at different times of day or under different weather conditions to reduce the daily rush of sightseers management allows visitors to purchase tickets in advance for a specific date and time at a discount on tickets purchased on the spot on february the observation deck was closed to the public for two months after power supply problems caused an elevator to become stuck between floors trapping a group of tourists for minutes when the tide is low and visibility is high people can see the shores of iran which is around km or mi away from the top of the skyscraper burj khalifa is surrounded by an eleven hectare acre park designed by landscape architects swa group like the tower the park s design was based on the flower of the hymenocallis a desert plant at the centre of the park is the water room which is a series of pools and water jet fountains benches and signs incorporate images of burj khalifa and the hymenocallis flower the plants are watered by water collected from the building s cooling system the system provides l us gal annually wet enterprises who also developed the dubai fountain developed the park s six water features on the higher floors the sun can still be seen for several minutes after it has set at ground level this has led dubai clerics to rule that those living above the th floor should wait additional minutes to break their ramadan fast and those living above the th floor minutes the tower was constructed by samsung c t from south korea which also did work on the petronas twin towers and taipei samsung c t built the tower in a joint venture with besix from belgium and arabtec from the uae turner was the project manager on the main construction contract hong kong based far east aluminum combined to provide the exterior cladding for burj khalifa the contractor and the engineer of record was hyder consulting under uae law the contractor and the engineer of record is jointly and severally liable for the performance of burj khalifa the primary structure is reinforced concrete putzmeister created a new super high pressure trailer concrete pump the bsa shp d for this project burj khalifa s construction used m cu yd of concrete and tonnes short tons long tons of steel rebar and construction took million man hours in may putzmeister pumped concrete with more than mpa ultimate compressive strength of gravel to surpass the meters weight of the effective area of each column from the foundation to the next fourth level and the rest was by metal columns jacketed or covered with concrete to a then world record delivery height of m ft the th floor three tower cranes were used during the construction of the uppermost levels each capable of lifting a tonne load the remaining structure above was constructed of lighter steel in test holes were drilled to study the strength of the bedrock underlying the structure weak to very weak sandstone and siltstone was found just metres below the surface citation needed samples were taken from test holes drilled to a depth of metres finding weak to very weak rock all the way the study described the site as part of a seismically active area citation needed another challenging element was the shamal which often creates sandstorms over m cu yd of concrete weighing more than tonnes short tons long tons were used to construct the concrete and steel foundation which features piles each pile is metre in diameter by m in length buried more than m ft deep the foundation was designed to support the total building weight of approximately tonnes short tons long tons this weight was then divided by the compressive strength of concrete which is mpa which yielded sq meters of vertical normal effective area which then yielded meters by meters dimensions a cathodic protection system is under the concrete to neutralize the sulphate and chloride rich groundwater and prevent corrosion during the construction of the burj khalifa over tonnes of structural steel which held the palace of the republic the former parliament building of the german democratic republic the volkskammer in east berlin together were shipped to dubai in the burj khalifa is highly compartmentalised pressurized air conditioned refuge floors are located every floors on floors g etc where people can shelter on their long walk down to safety in case of an emergency or fire special mixes of concrete were made to withstand the extreme pressures of the massive building weight as is typical with reinforced concrete construction each batch of concrete was tested to ensure it could withstand certain pressures ctlgroup working for skidmore owings and merrill conducted the creep and shrinkage testing critical for the structural analysis of the building the consistency of the concrete used in the project was essential it was difficult to create a concrete that could withstand both the thousands of tonnes bearing down on it and persian gulf temperatures that can reach c f to combat this problem the concrete was not poured during the day instead during the summer months ice was added to the mixture and it was poured at night when the air was cooler and the humidity was higher cooler concrete cures more evenly and is therefore less likely to set too quickly and crack any significant cracks could have put the entire project in jeopardy in march mohamed ali alabbar chairman of the project s developer emaar properties said office space pricing at burj khalifa reached us per sq ft over us per m and the armani residences also in burj khalifa sold for us per sq ft over us per m he estimated the total cost for the project to be about us billion the project s completion coincided with the financial crisis of and with vast overbuilding in the country leading to high vacancies and foreclosures with dubai mired in debt from its huge ambitions the government was forced to seek multibillion dollar bailouts from its oil rich neighbor abu dhabi subsequently in a surprise move at its opening ceremony the tower was renamed burj khalifa said to honour the uae president khalifa bin zayed al nahyan for his crucial support because of the slumping demand in dubai s property market the rents in the burj khalifa plummeted some ten months after its opening out of apartments in the tower were still empty at that time however over the next two and a half years overseas investors steadily began to purchase the available apartments and office space by october emaar reported that around of the apartments were occupied the ceremony was broadcast live on a giant screen on burj park island and on smaller screens elsewhere hundreds of media outlets from around the world reported live from the scene in addition to the media presence guests were expected the opening was held on january the ceremony featured a display of fireworks light beams projected on and around the tower and further sound light and water effects the celebratory lighting was designed by uk lighting designers speirs and major associates using the powerful stroboscope lights that are integrated into the fa ade and spire of the tower different lighting sequences were choreographed together with more than different combinations of other effects citation needed within months of the building s official opening a man described as an asian in his mid s who worked at one of the companies in the tower died by suicide on may by jumping from the th floor he fell floors landing on a deck on the th floor dubai police confirmed the act as a suicide reporting that they also came to know that the man decided to commit suicide as his company refused to grant leave on may dubai police disputed a report that a portuguese national who was in dubai on a tourist visa fell to her death from burj khalifa s at the top sky observation deck on the th floor and said that this incident took place in jumeirah lakes towers a dubai coroner s report stated her body was found on the third floor of the burj khalifa emails obtained under the freedom of information act from portugal s embassy in the uae also confirmed that she had committed suicide from the th floor of the burj khalifa the burj khalifa was built primarily by workers from south asia and east asia this is generally because the current generation of uae locals prefer governmental jobs and do not have an attitude favouring private sector employment on june there were about skilled workers employed at the construction site press reports indicated in that skilled carpenters at the site earned a day and labourers earned according to a bbc investigation and a human rights watch report the workers were housed in abysmal conditions and worked long hours for low pay during construction only one construction related death was reported however workplace injuries and fatalities in the uae are poorly documented according to human rights watch in march about workers upset over buses that were delayed for the end of their shifts protested and triggered a riot damaging cars offices computers and construction equipment a dubai interior ministry official said the rioters caused almost in damage most of the workers involved in the riot returned the following day but refused to work emaar new year s eve is an annual event held every december at burj khalifa the world s tallest building in dubai the united arab emirates organized by emaar emaar new year s eve has won two guinness world records including largest led illuminated facade in and in emaar celebrated togetherness in honor of frontline heroes during the beginning of the covid pandemic the emaar new year s eve fireworks celebration originated in with the inauguration of the world s tallest building burj khalifa the celebration was broadcast live to more than two million people and lasted for three minutes an accompanying sound and light show was choreographed by the dubai fountain since the broadcasting rights have been held by dubai media incorporated dmi and dubai tv the event is also broadcast live around the world in and emaar new year s eve was broadcast live on twitter and youtube in it was broadcast live for the first time on zoom the building has been used by several experienced base jumpers for authorised and unauthorised base jumping on march alain spiderman robert scaled the outside of burj khalifa the climb to the top of the spire took six hours to comply with uae safety laws robert who usually climbs in free solo style used a rope and harness in june burj khalifa was the recipient of the best tall building middle east africa award by the council on tall buildings and urban habitat on september burj khalifa won the award for the best project of the year at the middle east architect awards awards chair gordon gill of adrian smith gordon gill architecture said we are talking about a building here that has changed the landscape of what is possible in architecture a building that became internationally recognized as an icon long before it was even completed building of the century was thought a more apt title for it burj khalifa was also the recipient of the following awards

 the golden gate bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the golden gate the one mile wide km strait connecting san francisco bay and the pacific ocean the structure links the u s city of san francisco california the northern tip of the san francisco peninsula to marin county carrying both u s route and california state route across the strait it also carries pedestrian and bicycle traffic and is designated as part of u s bicycle route being declared one of the wonders of the modern world by the american society of civil engineers the bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of san francisco and california it was initially designed by engineer joseph strauss in the bridge was named for the golden gate strait the channel that it spans the frommer s travel guide describes the golden gate bridge as possibly the most beautiful certainly the most photographed bridge in the world at the time of its opening in it was both the longest and the tallest suspension bridge in the world with a main span of feet m and a total height of feet m before the bridge was built the only practical short route between san francisco and what is now marin county was by boat across a section of san francisco bay a ferry service began as early as with a regularly scheduled service beginning in the s for the purpose of transporting water to san francisco the sausalito land and ferry company service launched in eventually became the golden gate ferry company a southern pacific railroad subsidiary the largest ferry operation in the world by the late s once for railroad passengers and customers only southern pacific s automobile ferries became very profitable and important to the regional economy the ferry crossing between the hyde street pier in san francisco and sausalito ferry terminal in marin county took approximately minutes and cost per vehicle when a price later reduced to compete with the new bridge better source needed the trip from the san francisco ferry building took minutes many wanted to build a bridge to connect san francisco to marin county san francisco was the largest american city still served primarily by ferry boats because it did not have a permanent link with communities around the bay the city s growth rate was below the national average many experts said that a bridge could not be built across the foot metre strait which had strong swirling tides and currents with water ft m deep at the center of the channel and frequent strong winds experts said that ferocious winds and blinding fogs would prevent construction and operation although the idea of a bridge spanning the golden gate was not new the proposal that eventually took hold was made in a san francisco bulletin article by former engineering student james wilkins san francisco s city engineer estimated the cost at million equivalent to billion today and impractical for the time he asked bridge engineers whether it could be built for less one who responded joseph strauss was an ambitious engineer and poet who had for his graduate thesis designed a mile long km railroad bridge across the bering strait at the time strauss had completed some drawbridges most of which were inland and nothing on the scale of the new project strauss s initial drawings were for a massive cantilever on each side of the strait connected by a central suspension segment which strauss promised could be built for million equivalent to million today local authorities agreed to proceed only on the assurance that strauss would alter the design and accept input from several consulting project experts citation needed a suspension bridge design was considered the most practical because of recent advances in metallurgy strauss spent more than a decade drumming up support in northern california the bridge faced opposition including litigation from many sources the department of war was concerned that the bridge would interfere with ship traffic the us navy feared that a ship collision or sabotage to the bridge could block the entrance to one of its main harbors unions demanded guarantees that local workers would be favored for construction jobs southern pacific railroad one of the most powerful business interests in california opposed the bridge as competition to its ferry fleet and filed a lawsuit against the project leading to a mass boycott of the ferry service in may colonel herbert deakyne held the second hearing on the bridge on behalf of the secretary of war in a request to use federal land for construction deakyne on behalf of the secretary of war approved the transfer of land needed for the bridge structure and leading roads to the bridging the golden gate association and both san francisco county and marin county pending further bridge plans by strauss another ally was the fledgling automobile industry which supported the development of roads and bridges to increase demand for automobiles the bridge s name was first used when the project was initially discussed in by m m o shaughnessy city engineer of san francisco and strauss the name became official with the passage of the golden gate bridge and highway district act by the state legislature in creating a special district to design build and finance the bridge san francisco and most of the counties along the north coast of california joined the golden gate bridge district with the exception being humboldt county whose residents opposed the bridge s construction and the traffic it would generate strauss was the chief engineer in charge of the overall design and construction of the bridge project however because he had little understanding or experience with cable suspension designs responsibility for much of the engineering and architecture fell on other experts strauss s initial design proposal two double cantilever spans linked by a central suspension segment was unacceptable from a visual standpoint the final graceful suspension design was conceived and championed by leon moisseiff the engineer of the manhattan bridge in new york city irving morrow a relatively unknown residential architect designed the overall shape of the bridge towers the lighting scheme and art deco elements such as the tower decorations streetlights railing and walkways the famous international orange color was morrow s personal selection winning out over other possibilities including the us navy s suggestion that it be painted with black and yellow stripes to ensure visibility by passing ships senior engineer charles alton ellis collaborating remotely with moisseiff was the principal engineer of the project moisseiff produced the basic structural design introducing his deflection theory by which a thin flexible roadway would flex in the wind greatly reducing stress by transmitting forces via suspension cables to the bridge towers although the golden gate bridge design has proved sound a later moisseiff design the original tacoma narrows bridge collapsed in a strong windstorm soon after it was completed because of an unexpected aeroelastic flutter ellis was also tasked with designing a bridge within a bridge in the southern abutment to avoid the need to demolish fort point a pre civil war masonry fortification viewed even then as worthy of historic preservation he penned a graceful steel arch spanning the fort and carrying the roadway to the bridge s southern anchorage ellis was a greek scholar and mathematician who at one time was a university of illinois professor of engineering despite having no engineering degree he eventually earned a degree in civil engineering from the university of illinois prior to designing the golden gate bridge and spent the last twelve years of his career as a professor at purdue university he became an expert in structural design writing the standard textbook of the time ellis did much of the technical and theoretical work that built the bridge but he received none of the credit in his lifetime in november strauss fired ellis and replaced him with a former subordinate clifford paine ostensibly for wasting too much money sending telegrams back and forth to moisseiff ellis obsessed with the project and unable to find work elsewhere during the depression continued working hours per week on an unpaid basis eventually turning in ten volumes of hand calculations with an eye toward self promotion and posterity strauss downplayed the contributions of his collaborators who despite receiving little recognition or compensation are largely responsible for the final form of the bridge he succeeded in having himself credited as the person most responsible for the design and vision of the bridge only much later were the contributions of the others on the design team properly appreciated in may the golden gate bridge district issued a formal report on years of stewardship of the famous bridge and decided to give ellis major credit for the design of the bridge the golden gate bridge and highway district authorized by an act of the california legislature was incorporated in as the official entity to design construct and finance the golden gate bridge however after the wall street crash of the district was unable to raise the construction funds so it lobbied for a million bond measure equivalent to million today the bonds were approved in november by votes in the counties affected by the bridge the construction budget at the time of approval was million million today however the district was unable to sell the bonds until when amadeo giannini the founder of san francisco based bank of america agreed on behalf of his bank to buy the entire issue in order to help the local economy construction began on january the project cost more than million million in dollars and was completed ahead of schedule and million under budget equivalent to million today the golden gate bridge construction project was carried out by the mcclintic marshall construction co a subsidiary of bethlehem steel corporation founded by howard h mcclintic and charles d marshall both of lehigh university strauss remained head of the project overseeing day to day construction and making some groundbreaking contributions a graduate of the university of cincinnati he placed a brick from his alma mater s demolished mcmicken hall in the south anchorage before the concrete was poured strauss also innovated the use of movable safety netting beneath the men working which saved many lives nineteen men saved by the nets over the course of the project formed the half way to hell club nonetheless eleven men were killed in falls ten on february when a scaffold with twelve men on it and secured by undersized bolts fell into and broke through the safety net two of the twelve survived the foot m fall into the water the bridge opened may the bridge round house diner was then included in the southeastern end of the golden gate bridge adjacent to the tourist plaza which was renovated in the bridge round house an art deco design by alfred finnila completed in has been popular throughout the years as a starting point for various commercial tours of the bridge and an unofficial gift shop the diner was renovated in and the gift shop was then removed as a new official gift shop has been included in the adjacent plaza during the bridge work the assistant civil engineer of california alfred finnila had overseen the entire iron work of the bridge as well as half of the bridge s road work plaque of the major contributors to the golden gate bridge lists contractors engineering staff directors and officers contractors engineering staff directors officers on december a windstorm revealed swaying and rolling instabilities of the bridge resulting in its closure in and the bridge was retrofitted with lateral and diagonal bracing that connected the lower chords of the two side trusses this bracing stiffened the bridge deck in torsion so that it would better resist the types of twisting that had destroyed the tacoma narrows bridge in the original bridge used a concrete deck salt carried by fog or mist reached the rebar causing corrosion and concrete spalling from to the original bridge deck in sections was systematically replaced with a lighter and stronger steel orthotropic deck panels over nights without closing the roadway completely to traffic the roadway was also widened by two feet resulting in outside curb lane width of feet instead of feet for the inside lanes this deck replacement was the bridge s greatest engineering project since it was built and cost over million the bridge opening celebration in began on may and lasted for one week the day before vehicle traffic was allowed people crossed either on foot or on roller skates on opening day mayor angelo rossi and other officials rode the ferry to marin then crossed the bridge in a motorcade past three ceremonial barriers the last a blockade of beauty queens who required joseph strauss to present the bridge to the highway district before allowing him to pass an official song there s a silver moon on the golden gate was chosen to commemorate the event strauss wrote a poem that is now on the golden gate bridge entitled the mighty task is done the next day president franklin d roosevelt pushed a button in washington d c signaling the official start of vehicle traffic over the bridge at noon weeks of civil and cultural activities called the fiesta followed a statue of strauss was moved in to a site near the bridge as part of the fiftieth anniversary celebration in the golden gate bridge district again closed the bridge to automobile traffic and allowed pedestrians to cross it on may this sunday morning celebration attracted to people and ineffective crowd control meant the bridge became congested with roughly people causing the center span of the bridge to flatten out under the weight although the bridge is designed to flex in that way under heavy loads and was estimated not to have exceeded of the yielding stress of the suspension cables bridge officials stated that uncontrolled pedestrian access was not being considered as part of the th anniversary on sunday may because of the additional law enforcement costs required since a pedestrian poses at the old railing on opening day opening of the golden gate bridge official invitation to the opening of the bridge this copy was sent to the city of seattle on the th anniversary of the golden gate bridge in individuals and organizations were invited to buy a commemorative brick to fund the th anniversary celebration those bricks were installed on the ground creating a brick promenade its location is shown on the map more than donors responded personalizing their brick with inscriptions and tributes unfortunately years later for the upcoming th of the golden gate bridge the need for a dda compliant area as the slope was too steep implied remodeling the whole promenade doing so and contractors being unable to properly take bricks out one by one the brick promenade was demolished and the contributors were unable to get their bricks back however to honor and respect their contributions all the donors names and the inscriptions they had chosen for their bricks have been preserved and written on panels the panels are located inside the equator coffees on its rounded walls the names and inscriptions are listed in the alphabetical order to make them easier to read and find this website has been keeping a maps view of the original brick promenade and the database of all donors names and inscriptions to help find and locate them on the original layout as of october the website is unfortunately down until the golden gate bridge had the longest suspension bridge main span in the world at feet m since its main span length has been surpassed by seventeen bridges it now has the second longest main span in the americas after the verrazzano narrows bridge in new york city the total length of the golden gate bridge from abutment to abutment is feet m the golden gate bridge s clearance above high water averages feet m while its towers at feet m above the water were the world s tallest on a suspension bridge until when it was surpassed by the mezcala bridge in mexico the weight of the roadway is hung from pairs of vertical suspender ropes which are attached to two main cables the main cables pass over the two main towers and are fixed in concrete at each end each cable is made of strands of wire the total length of galvanized steel wire used to fabricate both main cables is estimated to be miles km each of the bridge s two towers has approximately rivets in the s when the bay area rapid transit system bart was being planned the engineering community had conflicting opinions about the feasibility of running train tracks north to marin county over the bridge in june consultants hired by bart completed a study that determined the bridge s suspension section was capable of supporting service on a new lower deck in july one of the bridge s consulting engineers clifford paine disagreed with their conclusion in january due to more conflicting reports on feasibility the bridge s board of directors appointed an engineering review board to analyze all the reports the review board s report released in april concluded that running bart on the bridge was not advisable aesthetics was the foremost reason why the first design of joseph strauss was rejected upon re submission of his bridge construction plan he added details such as lighting to outline the bridge s cables and towers in it was ranked fifth on the list of america s favorite architecture by the american institute of architects the color of the bridge is officially an orange vermilion called international orange the color was selected by consulting architect irving morrow because it complements the natural surroundings and enhances the bridge s visibility in fog the bridge was originally painted with red lead primer and a lead based topcoat which was touched up as required in the mid s a program was started to improve corrosion protection by stripping the original paint and repainting the bridge with zinc silicate primer and vinyl topcoats since acrylic topcoats have been used instead for air quality reasons the program was completed in and it is now maintained by painters who touch up the paintwork where it becomes seriously corroded the ongoing maintenance task of painting the bridge is continuous a view of the golden gate bridge from the marin headlands on a foggy morning at sunrise view of marin from the south tower top of the south tower most maps and signage mark the bridge as part of the concurrency between u s route and california state route although part of the national highway system the bridge is not officially part of california s highway system for example under the california streets and highways code route ends at the approach to the golden gate bridge and then resumes at a point in marin county opposite san francisco the golden gate bridge highway and transportation district has jurisdiction over the segment of highway that crosses the bridge instead of the california department of transportation caltrans the movable median barrier between the lanes is moved several times daily to conform to traffic patterns on weekday mornings traffic flows mostly southbound into the city so four of the six lanes run southbound conversely on weekday afternoons four lanes run northbound during off peak periods and weekends traffic is split with three lanes in each direction from to opposing traffic was separated by small plastic pylons during that time there were fatalities resulting from head on collisions to improve safety the speed limit on the golden gate bridge was reduced from to mph to km h on october although there had been discussion concerning the installation of a movable barrier since the s only in march did the bridge board of directors commit to finding funding to complete the million study required prior to the installation of a movable median barrier installation of the resulting barrier was completed on january following a closure of hours to private vehicle traffic the longest in the bridge s history the new barrier system including the zipper trucks cost approximately million to purchase and install the bridge carries about vehicles per day according to the golden gate bridge highway and transportation district the bridge is popular with pedestrians and bicyclists and was built with walkways on either side of the six vehicle traffic lanes initially they were separated from the traffic lanes by only a metal curb but railings between the walkways and the traffic lanes were added in primarily as a measure to prevent bicyclists from falling into the roadway the bridge was designated as part of u s bicycle route in the main walkway is on the eastern side and is open for use by both pedestrians and bicycles in the morning to mid afternoon during weekdays a m to p m and to pedestrians only for the remaining daylight hours until p m or p m during dst the eastern walkway is reserved for pedestrians on weekends a m to p m or p m during dst and is open exclusively to bicyclists in the evening and overnight when it is closed to pedestrians the western walkway is open only for bicyclists and only during the hours when they are not allowed on the eastern walkway bus service across the bridge is provided by two public transportation agencies san francisco muni and golden gate transit muni offers saturday and sunday service on the marin headlands express bus line and golden gate transit runs numerous bus lines throughout the week the southern end of the bridge near the toll plaza and parking lot is also accessible daily from a m to midnight by muni line the marin airporter a private company also offers service across the bridge between marin county and san francisco international airport a visitor center and gift shop originally called the bridge pavilion since renamed the golden gate bridge welcome center is located on the san francisco side of the bridge adjacent to the southeast parking lot it opened in in time for the bridge s th anniversary celebration a cafe outdoor exhibits and restroom facilities are located nearby on the marin side of the bridge only accessible from the northbound lanes is the h dana bower rest area and vista point named after the first landscape architect for the california division of highways lands and waters under and around the bridge are homes to varieties of wildlife such as bobcats harbor seals and sea lions three species of cetaceans whales that had been absent in the area for many years have shown recent when recoveries re colonizations in the vicinity of the bridge researchers studying them have encouraged stronger protections and recommended that the public watch them from the bridge or from land or use a local whale watching operator tolls are only collected from southbound traffic at the toll plaza on the san francisco side of the bridge all electronic tolling has been in effect since and drivers may either pay using the fastrak electronic toll collection device using the license plate tolling program or via a one time payment online effective july june the regular toll rate for passenger cars is with fastrak users paying a discounted toll of during peak traffic hours carpool vehicles carrying three or more people or motorcycles may pay a discounted toll of if they have fastrak and use the designated carpool lane drivers must pay within hours after crossing the bridge or they will be sent a toll violation invoice the toll violation penalty is and additional fees will be added if it is not paid within days when the golden gate bridge opened in the toll was cents per car equivalent to in collected in each direction in it was reduced to cents each way in then lowered to cents in in in the bridge was converted to only collect tolls from southbound traffic with the toll amount reset back to cents in the last of the construction bonds were retired in with million equivalent to m in in principal and nearly million m in in interest raised entirely from bridge tolls tolls continued to be collected and subsequently incrementally raised in the toll was raised a dollar to equivalent to in the bridge began accepting tolls via the fastrak electronic toll collection system in with tolls for fastrak users and for those paying cash equivalent to and respectively in in november the golden gate bridge highway and transportation district recommended a corporate sponsorship program for the bridge to address its operating deficit projected at million over five years the district promised that the proposal which it called a partnership program would not include changing the name of the bridge or placing advertising on the bridge itself in october the board unanimously voted to discontinue the proposal and seek additional revenue through other means most likely a toll increase the district later increased the toll amounts in to for fastrak users and to those paying cash equivalent to and respectively in in an effort to save million over the following years the golden gate district voted in january to eliminate all toll takers by and use only open road tolling subsequently this was delayed and toll taker elimination occurred in march the cost savings have been revised to million over an eight year period in addition to fastrak the golden gate transportation district implemented the use of license plate tolling branded as pay by plate and also a one time payment system for drivers to pay before or after their trip on the bridge twenty eight positions were eliminated as part of this plan on april the toll for users of fastrak was increased from to equivalent to in while the toll for drivers using either the license plate tolling or the one time payment system was raised from to equivalent to in bicycle pedestrian and northbound motor vehicle traffic remain toll free for vehicles with more than two axles the toll rate was per axle for those using license plate tolling or the one time payment system and per axle for fastrak users during peak traffic hours carpool vehicles carrying two or more people and motorcycles paid a discounted toll of equivalent to in drivers must have had fastrak to take advantage of this carpool rate the golden gate transportation district then increased the tolls by cents in july and then by another cents each of the next three years in march the golden gate transportation district approved a plan to implement cent annual toll increases through except for the toll by plate program which will increase by cents per year in march the golden gate bridge district board approved a resolution to start congestion pricing at the golden gate bridge charging higher tolls during the peak hours but rising and falling depending on traffic levels this decision allowed the bay area to meet the federal requirement to receive million in federal transportation funds from usdot urban partnership grant as a condition of the grant the congestion toll was to be in place by september in august transportation officials ended the congestion pricing program in favor of varying rates for metered parking along the route to the bridge including on lombard street and van ness avenue the golden gate bridge is the most used suicide site in the world the deck is about feet m above the water after a fall of four seconds jumpers hit the water at around mph km h m s most die from impact trauma about survive the initial impact but generally drown or die of hypothermia in the cold water after years of debate and an estimated more than deaths suicide barriers consisting of a stainless steel net extending feet from the bridge and supported by structural steel feet under the walkway began to be installed in april construction was first estimated to take approximately four years at a cost of over million in december it was reported that construction of the suicide prevention net had fallen two years behind schedule because the lead contractor shimmick construction co had been sold in leading to the slowdown of several existing projects as of december the completion date for the golden gate bridge net was set for the golden gate bridge was designed to safely withstand winds of up to mph km h until the bridge was closed because of weather conditions only three times on december because of gusts of mph km h on december because of winds of mph km h and on december because of wind gusts of mph km h an anemometer placed midway between the two towers on the west side of the bridge has been used to measure wind speeds another anemometer was placed on one of the towers as part of the retrofitting of the bridge and installation of the suicide barrier starting in the railings on the west side of the pedestrian walkway were replaced with thinner more flexible slats in order to improve the bridge s aerodynamic tolerance of high wind to mph km h starting in june reports were received of a loud hum heard across san francisco and marin county produced by the new railing slats when a strong west wind was blowing the sound had been predicted from wind tunnel tests but not included in the environmental impact report ways of ameliorating it are being considered an independent engineering analysis of a sound recording of the tones concludes that the singing noise comprises a variety of aeolian tones the sound produced by air flowing past a sharp edge arising in this case from the ambient wind blowing across metal slats of the newly installed sidewalk railings the tones observed were frequencies of and hz corresponding to the musical notes f g a and b these notes form an f lydian tetrachord modern knowledge of the effect of earthquakes on structures led to a program to retrofit the golden gate to better resist seismic events the proximity of the bridge to the san andreas fault places it at risk for a significant earthquake once thought to have been able to withstand any magnitude of foreseeable earthquake the bridge was actually vulnerable to complete structural failure i e collapse triggered by the failure of supports on the foot m arch over fort point a million program was initiated to improve the structure s ability to withstand such an event with only minimal repairable damage a custom built electro hydraulic synchronous lift system for construction of temporary support towers and a series of intricate lifts transferring the loads from the existing bridge onto the temporary supports were completed with engineers from balfour beatty and enerpac without disrupting day to day commuter traffic although the retrofit was initially planned to be completed in as of may update it was expected to take several more years the former elevated approach to the golden gate bridge through the san francisco presidio known as doyle drive dated to and was named after frank p doyle doyle the president of the exchange bank in santa rosa and son of the bank s founder was the man who more than any other person made it possible to build the golden gate bridge the highway carried about vehicles each weekday between downtown san francisco and the north bay and points north the road was deemed vulnerable to earthquake damage had a problematic lane design and lacked shoulders a san francisco county transportation authority study recommended that it be replaced construction on the billion replacement temporarily known as the presidio parkway began in december the elevated doyle drive was demolished on the weekend of april and traffic used a part of the partially completed presidio parkway until it was switched onto the finished presidio parkway on the weekend of july as of may update an official at caltrans said there is no plan to permanently rename the portion known as doyle drive

 the united states capitol often called the capitol or the capitol building is the seat of the legislative branch of the united states federal government which is formally known as the united states congress it is located on capitol hill at the eastern end of the national mall in washington d c though no longer at the geographic center of the federal district the capitol forms the origin point for the street numbering system of the district as well as its four quadrants central sections of the present building were completed in these were partly destroyed in the burning of washington then were fully restored within five years the building was later enlarged by extending the wings for the chambers for the bicameral legislature the house of representatives in the south wing and the senate in the north wing the massive dome was completed around just after the american civil war like the principal buildings of the executive and judicial branches the capitol is built in a neoclassical style and has a white exterior both its east and west elevations are formally referred to as fronts though only the east front was intended for the reception of visitors and dignitaries prior to establishing the nation s capital in washington d c the united states congress and its predecessors had met in philadelphia independence hall and congress hall new york city federal hall and a number of other locations york pennsylvania lancaster pennsylvania the maryland state house in annapolis maryland and nassau hall in princeton new jersey in september the first continental congress brought together delegates from the colonies in philadelphia followed by the second continental congress which met from may to march after adopting the articles of confederation in york pennsylvania the congress of the confederation was formed and convened in philadelphia from march until june when a mob of angry soldiers converged upon independence hall demanding payment for their service during the american revolutionary war congress requested that john dickinson the governor of pennsylvania call up the militia to defend congress from attacks by the protesters in what became known as the pennsylvania mutiny of dickinson sympathized with the protesters and refused to remove them from philadelphia as a result congress was forced to flee to princeton new jersey on june and met in annapolis maryland and trenton new jersey before ending up in new york city the united states congress was established upon ratification of the united states constitution and formally began on march new york city remained home to congress until july when the residence act was passed to pave the way for a permanent capital the decision of where to locate the capital was contentious but alexander hamilton helped broker a compromise in which the federal government would take on war debt incurred during the american revolutionary war in exchange for support from northern states for locating the capital along the potomac river as part of the legislation philadelphia was chosen as a temporary capital for ten years until december until the nation s capital in washington d c would be ready pierre peter charles l enfant was given the task of creating the city plan for the new capital city l enfant chose jenkin s hill as the site for the congress house with a grand avenue now pennsylvania avenue nw connecting it with the president s house and a public space containing a broader grand avenue now the national mall stretching westward to the potomac river see l enfant plan in reviewing l enfant s plan thomas jefferson insisted the legislative building be called the capitol rather than congress house the word capitol comes from latin and is associated with the temple of jupiter optimus maximus on capitoline hill one of the seven hills of rome the connection between the two is not clear in addition to coming up with a city plan l enfant had been tasked with designing the capitol and president s house however he was dismissed in february over disagreements with president george washington and the commissioners and there were no plans at that point for the capitol the word capitol has since been adopted following the example of the united states capitol in many jurisdictions also for other government buildings for instance the capitols in the individual capitals of the states of the united states this in turn has led to frequent misspellings of capitol and capital the former refers to a building which houses government institutions the latter refers to the entire city in spring united states secretary of state thomas jefferson proposed a design competition to solicit designs for the capitol and the president s house and set a four month deadline the prize for the competition was and a lot in the federal city at least ten individuals submitted designs for the capitol however the drawings were regarded as crude and amateurish reflecting the level of architectural skill present in the united states at the time the most promising of the submissions was by stephen hallet a trained french architect however hallet s designs were overly fancy with too much french influence and were deemed too costly a late entry by amateur architect william thornton was submitted on january to much praise for its grandeur simplicity and beauty by washington along with praise from thomas jefferson thornton was inspired by the east front of the louvre as well as the paris pantheon for the center portion of the design thornton s design was officially approved in a letter dated april from washington and thornton served as the first architect of the capitol and later first superintendent of the united states patent and trademark office in an effort to console hallet the commissioners appointed him to review thornton s plans develop cost estimates and serve as superintendent of construction hallet proceeded to pick apart and make drastic changes to thornton s design which he saw as costly to build and problematic in july jefferson convened a five member commission bringing hallet and thornton together along with james hoban winning architect of the president s palace to address problems with and revise thornton s plan hallet suggested changes to the floor plan which could be fitted within the exterior design by thornton the revised plan was accepted except that secretary jefferson and president washington insisted on an open recess in the center of the east front which was part of thornton s original plan the original design by thornton was later modified by the british american architects benjamin henry latrobe sr and then charles bulfinch the current cast iron dome and the house s new southern extension and senate new northern wing were designed by thomas ustick walter and august schoenborn a german immigrant in the s and were completed under the supervision of edward clark l enfant secured the lease of quarries at wigginton island and along aquia creek in virginia for use in the foundations and outer walls of the capitol in november surveying was under way soon after the jefferson conference plan for the capitol was accepted on september president george washington along with eight other freemasons dressed in masonic regalia laid the cornerstone which was made by silversmith caleb bentley construction proceeded with hallet working under supervision of james hoban who was also busy working on construction of the president s house also later known as the executive mansion despite the wishes of jefferson and the president hallet went ahead anyway and modified thornton s design for the east front and created a square central court that projected from the center with flanking wings which would house the legislative bodies hallet was dismissed by secretary jefferson on november george hadfield was hired on october as superintendent of construction but resigned three years later in may because of his dissatisfaction with thornton s plan and quality of work done thus far the senate north wing was completed in the senate and house shared quarters in the north wing until a temporary wooden pavilion was erected on the future site of the house wing which served for a few years for the representatives to meet in until the house of representatives south wing was finally completed in with a covered wooden temporary walkway connecting the two wings with the congressional chambers where the future center section with rotunda and dome would eventually be however the house of representatives moved early into their house wing in though the senate wing building was incomplete the capitol held its first session of the united states congress with both chambers in session on november the national legislature was moved to washington prematurely at the urging of president john adams in hopes of securing enough southern votes in the electoral college to be re elected for a second term as president for several decades beginning when the federal government moved to washington in the fall of the capitol building was used for sunday religious services as well as for governmental functions the first services were conducted in the hall of the house in the north wing of the building in the house moved to temporary quarters in the south wing called the oven which it vacated in returning to the north wing for three years then from to they were held in the then house chamber now called statuary hall when held in the house chamber the speaker s podium was used as the preacher s pulpit according to the u s library of congress exhibit religion and the founding of the american republic it is no exaggeration to say that on sundays in washington during the administrations of thomas jefferson and of james madison the state became the church within a year of his inauguration jefferson began attending church services in the chamber of the house of representatives madison followed jefferson s example although unlike jefferson who rode on horseback to church in the capitol madison came in a coach and four worship services in the house a practice that continued until after the civil war were acceptable to jefferson because they were nondiscriminatory and voluntary preachers of every protestant denomination appeared catholic priests began officiating in as early as january a female evangelist dorothy ripley delivered a camp meeting style exhortation in the house to jefferson vice president aaron burr and a crowded audience not long after the completion of both wings the capitol was partially burned by the british on august during the war of george bomford and joseph gardner swift both military engineers were called upon to help rebuild the capitol reconstruction began in and included redesigned chambers for both senate and house wings now sides which were completed by during the reconstruction congress met in the old brick capitol a temporary structure financed by local investors construction continued through to with the addition of the center section with front steps and columned portico and an interior rotunda rising above the first low dome of the capitol latrobe is principally connected with the original construction and many innovative interior features his successor bulfinch also played a major role such as design of the first low dome covered in copper by it became clear that the capitol could not accommodate the growing number of legislators arriving from newly admitted states a new design competition was held and president millard fillmore appointed philadelphia architect thomas u walter to carry out the expansion two new wings were added a new chamber for the house of representatives on the south side and a new chamber for the senate on the north when the capitol was expanded in the s some of the construction labor was carried out by slaves who cut the logs laid the stones and baked the bricks the original plan was to use workers brought in from europe however there was a poor response to recruitment efforts african americans some free and some enslaved along with scottish stonemasons comprised most of the workforce the expansion more than doubled the length of the united states capitol it dwarfed the original timber framed copper sheeted low dome of designed by charles bulfinch which was no longer in proportion with the increased size of the building in the decision was made to tear it down and replace it with the wedding cake style cast iron dome that stands today also designed by thomas u walter the new dome would stand three times the height of the original dome and feet m in diameter yet had to be supported on the existing masonry piers like mansart s dome at les invalides in paris which he had visited in walter s dome is double with a large oculus in the inner dome through which is seen the apotheosis of washington painted on a shell suspended from the supporting ribs which also support the visible exterior structure and the tholos that supports the statue of freedom a colossal statue that was raised to the top of the dome in the statue invokes the goddesses minerva or athena the

designer russell page created a suitable setting for them in a large meadow at the u s national arboretum in northeast washington as the national capitol columns where they were combined with a reflecting pool into an ensemble that reminds some visitors of the ruins of persepolis in persia besides the columns two hundred tons of the original stone were removed in several hundred blocks these were first stored on site at the capitol and then in an unused yard at the capitol power plant until that year the power plant was renovated and expanded in accordance with legislation passed in and the stones fell to the commission on the extension of the united states capitol as this body was long defunct responsibility for the material passed to the house and senate office building commissions these commissions then arranged for the national park service to store the debris at the back of a nps maintenance yard in rock creek park with the permission of the speaker of the house the united states capitol historical society has periodically mined the blocks for sandstone since the stone removed is used to make commemorative bookends which are still sold to support the capitol historical

in with completion scheduled before the presidential inauguration as of million in work around the skirt of the dome had been completed but other deterioration including at least cracks in the brittle iron that have led to rusting and seepage inside needed to be addressed before the august recess the senate appropriations committee voted to spend million to repair the exterior of the dome the house wanted to spend less on government operations but in late it was announced that renovations would take place over two years starting in spring extensive scaffolding was erected in enclosing and obscuring the dome all exterior scaffolding was removed by mid september with the increased use of technologies such as the internet a bid tendering process was approved in for a contract to install the multidirectional radio communication network for wi fi and mobile phone within the capitol building and annexes followed by the new capitol visitor center the winning bidder was an israeli company

around the inside of the base of the dome and is a chronological pictorial history of the united states from the landing of christopher columbus to the wright brothers s flight in kitty hawk north

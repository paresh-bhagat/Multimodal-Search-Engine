rescue its subsidiary disneyland paris the financial times reported on october the park is burdened by its debt which is calculated at about billion billion and roughly times its gross average earnings until june disney only held a minority stake in the resort in the walt disney company offered an informal takeover of euro disney s c a buying of the company from kingdom holding and an open offer of euros per share for the remaining stock this brought the walt disney company s total ownership to the walt disney company will also invest an additional billion euros to strengthen the company on june disney completed a tender offer to own over of euro disney and then implemented a full buyout of the shares they did not already own following the success of disneyland in california plans to build a similar theme park in europe emerged in with sites in frankfurt paris london or milan under consideration under the leadership of e cardon walker tokyo disneyland opened in in japan with instant success forming a catalyst for international expansion in late the heads of disney s theme park division dick nunis and jim cora presented a list of approximately possible european locations for the park britain france italy and spain were all considered however britain and italy were dropped from the list due to both lacking a suitable expanse of flat land by march the number of possible locations for the park had been reduced to four two in france and two in spain both nations saw the potential economic advantages of a disney theme park and offered competing financing deals to disney both spanish sites were located near the mediterranean and offered a subtropical climate similar to disney s parks in california and florida disney had asked each site to provide average temperatures for every month for the previous years which proved a complicated endeavour as none of the records were computerised the site in pego alicante became the front runner but the location was controversial as it would have meant the destruction of marjal de pego oliva marshlands a site of natural beauty and one of the last homes of the almost extinct samaruc or valencia toothcarp so there was some local outcry among environmentalists disney had also shown interest in a site near toulon in southern france not far from marseille the pleasing landscape of that region as well as its climate made the location a top competitor for what would be called euro disneyland however shallow bedrock was encountered beneath the site which would have rendered construction too difficult finally a site in the rural town of marne la vall e was chosen because of its proximity to paris and its central location in western europe this location was estimated to be no more than a four hour drive for million people and no more than a two hour flight for a further million michael eisner signed the first letter of agreement with the french government for the square kilometre acre site on december and the first financial contracts were drawn up during the following spring the final contract was signed by the leaders of the walt disney company and the french government and territorial collectivities on march construction began in august and in december an information centre named espace euro disney was opened to show the public what was being constructed plans for a theme park next to euro disneyland based on the entertainment industry disney mgm studios europe quickly went into development scheduled to open in with a construction budget of us billion the construction manager was bovis in order to provide lodging to patrons it was decided that disney owned hotel rooms would be built within the complex in march disney and a council of architects frank gehry michael graves robert a m stern stanley tigerman and robert venturi decided on an exclusively american theme in which each hotel would depict a region of the united states at the time of the opening in april seven hotels collectively housing rooms had been built an entertainment shopping and dining complex based on walt disney world s downtown disney was designed by frank gehry with its towers of oxidised silver and bronze coloured stainless steel under a canopy of lights it opened as festival disney for a projected daily attendance of euro disney planned to serve an estimated people per hour inside the euro disneyland park in order to accomplish this restaurants were built inside the park with a further restaurants built at the euro disney resort hotels and five at festival disney menus and prices were varied with an american flavor predominant and disney s precedent of not serving alcoholic beverages was continued in the park patio seats of park seating were installed to satisfy europeans expected preference of eating outdoors in good weather in test kitchens at walt disney world recipes were adapted for european tastes walter meyer executive chef for menu development at euro disney and executive chef of food projects development at walt disney world noted a few things we did need to change but most of the time people kept telling us do your own thing do what s american unlike disney s american theme parks euro disney aimed for permanent employees an estimated requirement of for the theme park itself as opposed to seasonal and temporary part time employees casting centres were set up in paris london and amsterdam however it was understood by the french government and disney that a concentrated effort would be made to tap into the local french labour market disney sought workers with sufficient communication skills who spoke two european languages french and one other and were socially outgoing following precedent euro disney set up its own disney university to train workers people had applied by november the prospect of a disney park in france was a subject of debate and controversy critics who included prominent french intellectuals denounced what they considered to be the cultural imperialism of euro disney and felt it would encourage an unhealthy american type of consumerism in france on june a group of french farmers blockaded euro disney in protest of farm policies supported at the time by the united states a journalist at the centre right french newspaper le figaro wrote i wish with all my heart that the rebels would set fire to euro disneyland ariane mnouchkine a parisian stage director named the concept a cultural chernobyl a phrase which would be echoed in the media during euro disney s initial years in response french philosopher michel serres noted it is not america that is invading us it is we who adore it who adopt its fashions and above all its words euro disney s c a s then chairman robert fitzpatrick responded we didn t come in and say o k we re going to put a beret and a baguette on mickey mouse we are who we are topics of controversy also included disney s american managers requiring english to be spoken at all meetings and disney s appearance code for members of staff which listed regulations and limitations for the use of makeup facial hair tattoos jewellery and more french labour unions mounted protests against the appearance code which they saw as an attack on individual liberty others criticised disney as being insensitive to french culture individualism and privacy because restrictions on individual or collective liberties were illegal under french law unless it could be demonstrated that the restrictions are requisite to the job and do not exceed what is necessary disney countered by saying that a ruling that barred them from imposing such an employment standard could threaten the image and long term success of the park for us the appearance code has a great effect from a product identification standpoint said thor degelmann euro disney s personnel director without it we couldn t be presenting the disney product that people would be expecting euro disney opened for employee preview and testing in march during this time visitors were mostly park employees and their family members who tested facilities and operations the press was able to visit the day before the park s opening day on april on april euro disney resort and its theme park euro disneyland officially opened visitors were warned of chaos on the roads a government survey indicated that half a million people carried by cars might attempt to enter the complex french radio warned traffic to avoid the area by midday the car park was approximately half full suggesting an attendance level below explanations of the lower than expected turnout included speculation that people heeded the advice to stay away and that the one day strike that cut the direct rer railway connection to euro disney from the centre of paris made the park inaccessible due to the european recession that august the park faced financial difficulties as there were a lack of things to do and an overabundance of hotels leading to underperformance the failure of euro disney caused the cancellation of several projects like westcot disney s america tomorrowland at disneyland and beastly kingdom at disney s animal kingdom a new indiana jones roller coaster ride was opened at euro disney in a few weeks after the ride opened there were problems with the emergency brakes which resulted in guest injuries in the company was still having financial difficulties there were rumours that euro disney was getting close to having to file for bankruptcy the banks and the backers had meetings to work out some of the financial problems facing euro disney in march team disney went into negotiations with the banks so that they could get some help for their debt as a last resort the walt disney company threatened to close the disneyland paris park leaving the banks with the land in may entertainment magazine the hollywood reporter reported that about of euro disney s workforce approximately people had resigned from their jobs because of unacceptable working conditions it also reported that the park s attendance was far behind expectations the disappointing attendance can be at least partly explained by the recession and increased unemployment which was affecting france and most of the rest of the developed world at this time when construction of the resort began the economy was still on an upswing euro disney s c a responded in an interview with the wall street journal in which robert fitzpatrick claimed only people had left their jobs in response to the financial situation fitzpatrick ordered that the disney mgm studios europe project would be put on halt until a further decision could be made prices at the hotels were reduced despite these efforts in may park attendance was around some reports

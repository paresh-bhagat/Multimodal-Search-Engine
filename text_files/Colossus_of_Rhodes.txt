 the colossus of rhodes ancient greek romanized ho koloss s rh dios greek romanized koloss s tes rh dou a was a statue of the greek sun god helios erected in the city of rhodes on the greek island of the same name by chares of lindos in bc one of the seven wonders of the ancient world it was constructed to celebrate the successful defence of rhodes city against an attack by demetrius poliorcetes who had besieged it for a year with a large army and navy according to most contemporary descriptions the colossus stood approximately cubits or metres feet high approximately the height of the modern statue of liberty from feet to crown making it the tallest statue in the ancient world it collapsed during the earthquake of bc although parts of it were preserved in accordance with a certain oracle the rhodians did not build it again john malalas wrote that hadrian in his reign re erected the colossus but he was mistaken according to the suda the rhodians were called colossaeans because they erected the statue on the island in an arab force under muslim general muawiyah i conquered rhodes and according to the chronicle of theophanes the confessor the statue was completely destroyed and the remains sold since a series of as yet unrealized proposals to build a new colossus at rhodes harbour have been announced although the actual location of the original monument remains in dispute in the early fourth century bc rhodes allied with ptolemy i of egypt prevented a mass invasion staged by their common enemy antigonus i monophthalmus in bc a relief force of ships sent by ptolemy arrived and demetrius son of antigonus and his army abandoned the siege leaving behind most of their siege equipment to celebrate their victory the rhodians sold the equipment left behind for talents and decided to use the money to build a colossal statue of their patron god helios construction was left to the direction of chares a native of lindos in rhodes who had been involved with large scale statues before his teacher the sculptor lysippos had constructed a metre high foot bronze statue of zeus at tarentum construction began in bc ancient accounts which differ to some degree describe the structure as being built with iron tie bars to which brass plates were fixed to form the skin the interior of the structure which stood on a metre high foot white marble pedestal near the rhodes harbour entrance was then filled with stone blocks as construction progressed other sources place the colossus on a breakwater in the harbour according to most contemporary descriptions the statue itself was about cubits or metres feet tall much of the iron and bronze was reforged from the various weapons demetrius s army left behind and the abandoned second siege tower may have been used for scaffolding around the lower levels during construction philo of byzantium wrote in de septem mundi miraculis that chares created the sculpture in situ by casting it in horizontal courses and then placing a huge mound of earth around each section as soon as it was completed thus burying the finished work under the accumulated earth and carrying out the casting of the next part on the level modern engineers have put forward a plausible hypothesis for the statue s construction based on the technology of the time which was not based on the modern principles of earthquake engineering and the accounts of philo and pliny who saw and described the ruins the base pedestal was said to be at least metres feet in diameter and either circular or octagonal the feet were carved in stone and covered with thin bronze plates riveted together eight forged iron bars set in a radiating horizontal position formed the ankles and turned up to follow the lines of the legs while becoming progressively smaller individually cast curved bronze plates metres in square with turned in edges were joined together by rivets through holes formed during casting to form a series of rings the lower plates were millimetres in in thickness to the knee and millimetres in thick from knee to abdomen while the upper plates were to millimetres to in thick except where additional strength was required at joints such as the shoulder neck etc citation needed archaeologist ursula vedder has proposed that the sculpture was cast in large sections following traditional greek methods and that philo s account is not compatible with the situation proved by archaeology in ancient greece after twelve years in bc the statue was completed preserved in greek anthologies of poetry is what is believed to be the genuine dedication text for the colossus to you o sun the people of dorian rhodes set up this bronze statue reaching to olympus when they had pacified the waves of war and crowned their city with the spoils taken from the enemy not only over the seas but also on land did they kindle the lovely torch of freedom and independence for to the descendants of herakles belongs dominion over sea and land the statue stood for years until a bc earthquake caused significant damage to large portions of rhodes including the harbour and commercial buildings which were destroyed the statue snapped at the knees and fell over onto land ptolemy iii offered to pay for the reconstruction of the statue but the oracle of delphi made the rhodians fear that they had offended helios and they declined to rebuild it citation needed the remains lay on the ground for over years and even broken they were so impressive that many travelled to see them the remains were described briefly by strabo or bc c ad in his work geography book xiv chapter strabo was a greek geographer philosopher and historian who lived in asia minor during the transitional period of the roman republic into the roman empire strabo is best known for his work geographica geography which presented a descriptive history of people and places from different regions of the world known during his lifetime strabo states that the city of the rhodians lies on the eastern promontory of rhodes and it is so far superior to all others in harbours and roads and walls and improvements in general that i am unable to speak of any other city as equal to it or even as almost equal to it much less superior to it it is remarkable also for its good order and for its careful attention to the administration of affairs of state in general and in particular to that of naval affairs whereby it held the mastery of the sea for a long time and overthrew the business of piracy and became a friend to the romans and to all kings who favoured both the romans and the greeks consequently it not only has remained autonomous but also has been adorned with many votive offerings which for the most part are to be found in the dionysium and the gymnasium but partly in other places the best of these are first the colossus of helius of which the author of the iambic verse says seven times ten cubits in height the work of chares the lindian but it now lies on the ground having been thrown down by an earthquake and broken at the knees in accordance with a certain oracle the people did not raise it again this then is the most excellent of the votive offerings at any rate it is by common agreement one of the seven wonders pliny the elder ad was a roman author a naturalist and natural philosopher a naval and army commander of the early roman empire and a friend of emperor vespasian pliny wrote the encyclopedic naturalis historia natural history which became an editorial model for encyclopedias the naturalis historia is one of the largest single works to have survived from the roman empire to the modern day and purports to cover the entire field of ancient knowledge pliny remarked but that which is by far the most worthy of our admiration is the colossal statue of the sun which stood formerly at rhodes and was the work of chares the lindian a pupil of the above named lysippus no less than seventy cubits in height this statue fifty six years after it was erected was thrown down by an earthquake but even as it lies it excites our wonder and admiration few men can clasp the thumb in their arms and its fingers are larger than most statues where the limbs are broken asunder vast caverns are seen yawning in the interior within it too are to be seen large masses of rock by the weight of which the artist steadied it while erecting it in an arab force under muslim general muawiyah i captured rhodes and according to the chronicle of theophanes the confessor the statue was melted down and sold to a jewish merchant of edessa who loaded the bronze onto camels the arab destruction and the purported sale to a jew possibly originated as a powerful metaphor for nebuchadnezzar s dream of the destruction of a great statue the same story is recorded by bar hebraeus writing in syriac in the th century in edessa after the arab pillage of rhodes and a great number of men hauled on strong ropes which were tied around the brass colossus which was in the city and pulled it down and they weighed from it three thousand loads of corinthian brass and they sold it to a certain jew from emesa the syrian city of homs theophanes is the sole source of this account and all other sources can be traced to him rhodes has two serious earthquakes per century owing to its location on the seismically unstable hellenic arc pausanias tells us writing ca how the city was so devastated by an earthquake that the sibyl oracle foretelling its destruction was considered fulfilled this means the statue could not have survived for long if it was ever repaired by the th century rhodes was christianized meaning any further maintenance or rebuilding if there ever was any before on an ancient pagan statue is unlikely the metal would have likely been used for coins and maybe also tools by the time of the arab conquests especially during other conflicts such as the sassanian wars moreover the island was an important byzantine strategic point well into the ninth century so an arabic raid is unlikely to have stripped its metal since theophanes source was syriac it must have had vague information about a raid and attributed the statue s demise to it not knowing much more for these reasons as well as the negative perception of the arab conquests l i conrad considers the story of the dismantling of the statue likely to be propaganda like the destruction of the library of alexandria the harbour straddling colossus was a figment of medieval imaginations based on the dedication text s mention of over land and sea twice and the writings of an italian visitor who in noted that local tradition held that the right foot had stood where the church of st john of the colossus was then located many later illustrations show the statue with one foot on either side of the harbour mouth with ships passing under it references to this conception are also found in literary works shakespeare s cassius in julius caesar i ii says of caesar why man he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonourable graves shakespeare alludes to the colossus also in troilus and cressida v and in henry iv part v the new colossus a sonnet by emma lazarus written on a cast bronze plaque and mounted inside the pedestal of the statue of liberty in contrasts the latter with the brazen giant of greek fame with conquering limbs astride from land to land while these fanciful images feed the misconception the mechanics of the situation reveal that the colossus could not have straddled the harbour as described in lempri re s classical dictionary if the completed statue had straddled the harbour the entire mouth of the harbour would have been effectively closed during the entirety of the construction and the ancient rhodians did not have the means to dredge and re open the harbour after construction also the fallen statue would have blocked the harbour and since the ancient rhodians did not have the ability to remove the fallen statue from the harbour it would not have remained visible on land for the next years as discussed above even neglecting these objections the statue was made of bronze and engineering analyses indicate that it could not have been built with its legs apart without collapsing under its own weight many researchers have considered alternative positions for the statue which would have made it more feasible for actual construction by the ancients there is also no evidence that the statue held a torch aloft the records simply say that after completion the rhodians kindled the torch of freedom a relief in a nearby temple shows helios standing with one hand shielding his eyes similar to the way a person shields their eyes when looking toward the sun and it is quite possible that the colossus was constructed in the same pose while scholars do not know what the statue looked like they do have a good idea of what the head and face looked like as it was of a standard rendering at the time the head would have had curly hair with evenly spaced spikes of bronze or silver flame radiating similar to the images found on contemporary rhodian coins while scholars generally agree that anecdotal depictions of the colossus straddling the harbour s entry point have no historic or scientific basis the monument s actual location remains a matter of debate as mentioned above the statue is thought locally to have stood where two pillars now stand at the mandraki port entrance the floor of the fortress of st nicholas near the harbour entrance contains a circle of sandstone blocks of unknown origin or purpose curved blocks of marble that were incorporated into the fortress structure but are considered too intricately cut to have been quarried for that purpose have been posited as the remnants of a marble base for the colossus which would have stood on the sandstone block foundation archaeologist ursula vedder postulates that the colossus was not located in the harbour area at all but rather was part of the acropolis of rhodes which stood on a hill that overlooks the port area the ruins of a large temple traditionally thought to have been dedicated to apollo are situated at the highest point of the hill vedder believes that the structure would actually have been a helios sanctuary and a portion of its enormous stone foundation could have served as the supporting platform for the colossus in the guardian reported that a modern colossus was to be built at the harbour entrance by the german artist gert hof leading a cologne based team it was to be a giant light sculpture made partially out of melted down weapons from around the world it would cost up to million in december a group of european architects announced plans to build a modern colossus bestriding two piers at the harbour entrance despite a preponderance of evidence and scholarly opinion that the original monument could not have stood there the new statue metres ft tall five times the height of the original would cost an estimated us million funded by private donations and crowdsourcing the statue would include a cultural centre a library an exhibition hall and a lighthouse all powered by solar panels as of october update no such plans have been carried out and the website for the project is offline

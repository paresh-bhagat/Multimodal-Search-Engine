 the channel tunnel french tunnel sous la manche also known as the chunnel is a kilometre mi railway tunnel that connects folkestone kent england uk with coquelles hauts de france france beneath the english channel at the strait of dover it is the only fixed link between the island of great britain and the european mainland at its lowest point it is metres ft deep below the sea bed and metres ft below sea level at kilometres mi it has the longest underwater section of any tunnel in the world and is the third longest railway tunnel in the world the speed limit for trains through the tunnel is kilometres per hour mph the tunnel is owned and operated by the company getlink formerly groupe eurotunnel the tunnel carries high speed eurostar passenger trains the eurotunnel shuttle for road vehicles and international freight trains it connects end to end with the high speed railway lines of the lgv nord in france and high speed in england in through rail services carried million passengers and million tonnes of freight and the shuttle carried million passengers million cars coaches and million lorries equivalent to million tonnes of freight compared with million passengers million lorries and million cars by sea through the port of dover plans to build a cross channel fixed link appeared as early as but british political and media pressure over the compromising of national security had disrupted attempts to build one an early unsuccessful attempt was made in the late th century on the english side in the hope of forcing the hand of the english government the eventual successful project organised by eurotunnel began construction in and opened in estimated to cost billion in it was at the time the most expensive construction project ever proposed the cost finally amounted to billion equivalent to billion in well over its predicted budget since its construction the tunnel has experienced a number of mechanical problems both fires and cold weather have temporarily disrupted its operation since at least aggregations of migrants around calais seeking irregular undocumented and or otherwise illegal entry to the united kingdom such as through the tunnel have prompted deterrence and countermeasures as well as increased examination of ways to relieve the lands from which they are fleeing in albert mathieu favier a french mining engineer put forward a proposal to tunnel under the english channel with illumination from oil lamps horse drawn coaches and an artificial island positioned mid channel for changing horses his design envisaged a bored two level tunnel with the top tunnel used for transport and the bottom one for groundwater flows in aim thom de gamond a frenchman performed the first geological and hydrographical surveys on the channel between calais and dover he explored several schemes and in presented a proposal to napoleon iii for a mined railway tunnel from cap gris nez to east wear point with a port airshaft on the varne sandbank at a cost of million francs or less than million in a deputation led by george ward hunt proposed the idea of a tunnel to the chancellor of the exchequer of the day william ewart gladstone in henry marc brunel made a survey of the floor of the strait of dover by his results he proved that the floor was composed of chalk like the adjoining cliffs and thus a tunnel was feasible for this survey he invented the gravity corer which is still used in geology around william low and sir john hawkshaw promoted tunnel ideas but apart from preliminary geological studies none were implemented an official anglo french protocol was established in for a cross channel railway tunnel in british railway entrepreneur sir edward watkin and alexandre lavalley a french suez canal contractor were in the anglo french submarine railway company that conducted exploratory work on both sides of the channel on the english side a metre ft diameter beaumont english boring machine dug a metre ft pilot tunnel from shakespeare cliff on the french side a similar machine dug m ft from sangatte the project was abandoned in may owing to british political and press campaigns asserting that a tunnel would compromise britain s national defences these early works were encountered more than a century later during the tml project a film tunnelling the english channel by pioneer filmmaker georges m li s depicts king edward vii and president armand falli res dreaming of building a tunnel under the english channel in during the paris peace conference british prime minister david lloyd george repeatedly brought up the idea of a channel tunnel as a way of reassuring france about british willingness to defend against another german attack the french did not take the idea seriously and nothing came of the proposal in the s winston churchill advocated for the channel tunnel using that exact name in his essay should strategists veto the tunnel it was published on july in the weekly dispatch and argued vehemently against the idea that the tunnel could be used by a continental enemy in an invasion of britain churchill expressed his enthusiasm for the project again in an article for the daily mail on february why not a channel tunnel there was another proposal in but nothing came of this discussion and the idea was shelved proponents estimated the construction cost at us million the engineers had addressed the concerns of both nations military leaders by designing two sumps one near the coast of each country that could be flooded at will to block the tunnel but this did not appease military leaders or dispel concerns about hordes of tourists who would disrupt english life military fears continued during the second world war after the fall of france as britain prepared for an expected german invasion a royal navy officer in the directorate of miscellaneous weapons development calculated that hitler could use slave labour to build two channel tunnels in months the estimate caused rumours that germany had already begun digging a british film from gaumont studios the tunnel also called transatlantic tunnel was released in as a science fiction project concerning the creation of a transatlantic tunnel it referred briefly to its protagonist a mr mcallan as having completed a british channel tunnel successfully in five years into the future of the film s release by defence arguments had become less relevant due to the dominance of air power and both the british and french governments supported technical and geological surveys in the workings were cleared in preparation for a geological survey by the channel tunnel study group of the funding came from the channel tunnel co ltd the largest shareholder of which was the british transport commission as successor to the south eastern railway a detailed geological survey was carried out in and although the two countries agreed to build a tunnel in the phase initial studies and signing of a second agreement to cover phase took until the plan described a government funded project to create two tunnels to accommodate car shuttle wagons on either side of a service tunnel construction started on both sides of the channel in on january to the dismay of their french partners the then governing labour party in britain cancelled the project due to uncertainty about eec membership doubling cost estimates and the general economic crisis at the time by this time the british tunnel boring machine was ready and the ministry of transport had conducted a m ft experimental drive this short tunnel was eventually reused as the starting and access point for tunnelling operations from the british side the cancellation costs were estimated at million on the french side a tunnel boring machine had been installed underground in a stub tunnel it lay there for years until when it was sold dismantled refurbished and shipped to turkey where it was used to drive the moda tunnel for the istanbul sewerage scheme designed and supervised by british civil engineers binnie partners and officially opened by margaret thatcher in in the mouse hole project was suggested when the conservatives came to power in britain the concept was a single track rail tunnel with a service tunnel but without shuttle terminals the british government took no interest in funding the project but the british prime minister margaret thatcher did not object to a privately funded project although she said she assumed it would be for cars rather than trains in thatcher and french president fran ois mitterrand agreed to establish a working group to evaluate a privately funded project in june the franco british study group favoured a twin tunnel to accommodate conventional trains and a vehicle shuttle service in april promoters were invited to submit scheme proposals four submissions were shortlisted the cross channel ferry industry protested under the name flexilink in there was no campaign protesting a fixed link with one of the largest ferry operators sealink being state owned flexilink continued rousing opposition throughout and public opinion strongly favoured a drive through tunnel but concerns about ventilation accident management and driver mesmerisation led to the only shortlisted rail submission ctg f m being awarded the project in january reasons given for the selection included that it caused least disruption to shipping in the channel and least environmental disruption was the best protected against terrorism and was the most likely to attract sufficient private finance the british channel tunnel group consisted of two banks and five construction companies while their french counterparts france manche consisted of three banks and five construction companies the banks role was to advise on financing and secure loan commitments on july the groups formed channel tunnel group france manche ctg f m their submission to the british and french governments was drawn from the project including volumes and a substantial environmental impact statement the anglo french treaty on the channel tunnel was signed by both governments in canterbury cathedral the treaty of canterbury prepared the concession for the construction and operation of the fixed link by privately owned companies and outlined arbitration methods to be used in the event of disputes it set up the intergovernmental commission igc responsible for monitoring all matters associated with the tunnel s construction and operation on behalf of the british and french governments and a safety authority to advise the igc it drew a land frontier between the two countries in the middle of the channel tunnel the first of its kind design and construction was done by the ten construction companies in the ctg f m group the french terminal and boring from sangatte was done by the five french construction companies in the joint venture group gie transmanche construction the english terminal and boring from shakespeare cliff was done by the five british construction companies in the translink joint venture the two partnerships were linked by a bi national project organisation transmanche link tml the ma tre d oeuvre was a supervisory engineering body employed by eurotunnel under the terms of the concession that monitored the project and reported to the governments and banks in france with its long tradition of infrastructure investment the project had widespread approval the french national assembly approved it unanimously in april and after a public inquiry the senate approved it unanimously in june in britain select committees examined the proposal making history by holding hearings away from westminster in kent in february the third reading of the channel tunnel bill took place in the house of commons and passed by votes to the channel tunnel act gained royal assent and passed into law in july parliamentary support for the project came partly from provincial members of parliament on the basis of promises of regional eurostar through train services that never materialised the promises were repeated in when the contract for construction of the channel tunnel rail link was awarded the tunnel is a build own operate transfer boot project with a concession tml would design and build the tunnel but financing was through a separate legal entity eurotunnel eurotunnel absorbed ctg f m and signed a construction contract with tml but the british and french governments controlled final engineering and safety decisions now in the hands of the channel tunnel safety authority the british and french governments gave eurotunnel a year operating concession from extended by years to years in to repay loans and pay dividends a railway usage agreement was signed between eurotunnel british rail and sncf guaranteeing future revenue in exchange for the railways obtaining half of the tunnel s capacity private funding for such a complex infrastructure project was of unprecedented scale an initial equity of million was raised by ctg f m increased by million private institutional placement million was raised in a public share offer that included press and television advertisements a syndicated bank loan and letter of credit arranged billion privately financed the total investment costs at prices were billion at the completion actual costs were in prices billion an cost overrun the cost overrun was partly due to enhanced safety security and environmental demands financing costs were higher than forecast working from both the english and french sides of the channel eleven tunnel boring machines or tbms cut through chalk marl to construct two rail tunnels and a service tunnel the vehicle shuttle terminals are at cheriton part of folkestone and coquelles and are connected to the english m and french a motorways respectively tunnelling commenced in and the tunnel began operating in in prices the total construction cost was billion equivalent to billion in an cost overrun at the peak of construction people were employed with daily expenditure over million ten workers eight of them british were killed during construction between and most in the first few months of boring a mm in diameter pilot hole allowed the service tunnel to break through without ceremony on october on december englishman graham fagg and frenchman phillippe cozette broke through the service tunnel with the media watching eurotunnel completed the tunnel on time a bbc tv television commentator called graham fagg the first man to cross the channel by land for years the two tunnelling efforts met each other with an offset of only cm a paddington bear soft toy was chosen by british tunnellers as the first item to pass through to their french counterparts when the two sides met the tunnel was officially opened one year later than originally planned by queen elizabeth ii and the french president fran ois mitterrand in a ceremony held in calais on may the queen travelled through the tunnel to calais on a eurostar train which stopped nose to nose with the train that carried president mitterrand from paris following the ceremony president mitterrand and the queen travelled on le shuttle to a similar ceremony in folkestone a full public service did not start for several months the first freight train however ran on june and carried rover and mini cars being exported to italy the channel tunnel rail link ctrl now called high speed runs miles km from st pancras railway station in london to the tunnel portal at folkestone in kent it cost billion on september the prime minister tony blair opened the first section of high speed from folkestone to north kent on november the queen officially opened high speed and st pancras international station replacing the original slower link to waterloo international railway station high speed trains travel at up to km h mph the journey from london to paris taking hours minutes to brussels hour minutes in the american society of civil engineers elected the tunnel as one of the seven modern wonders of the world in the american magazine popular mechanics published the results opening was phased for various services offered as the channel tunnel safety authority the igc gave permission for various services to begin at several dates over the period but start up dates were a few days later surveying undertaken in the years before construction confirmed earlier speculations that a tunnel could be bored through a chalk marl stratum the chalk marl is conducive to tunnelling with impermeability ease of excavation and strength the chalk marl runs along the entire length of the english side of the tunnel but on the french side a length of kilometres mi has variable and difficult geology the tunnel consists of three bores two metre ft diameter rail tunnels metres ft apart kilometres mi in length with a metre ft diameter service tunnel in between the three bores are connected by cross passages and piston relief ducts the service tunnel was used as a pilot tunnel boring ahead of the main tunnels to determine the conditions english access was provided at shakespeare cliff french access from a shaft at sangatte the french side used five tunnel boring machines tbms the english side six the service tunnel uses service tunnel transport system stts and light service tunnel vehicles ladogs fire safety was a critical design issue between the portals at beussingue and castle hill the tunnel is kilometres mi long with kilometres mi under land on the french side and kilometres mi on the uk side and kilometres mi under sea it is the third longest rail tunnel in the world behind the gotthard base tunnel in switzerland and the seikan tunnel in japan but with the longest under sea section the average depth is metres ft below the seabed on the uk side of the expected million cubic metres cu yd of spoil approximately million cubic metres cu yd was used for fill at the terminal site and the remainder was deposited at lower shakespeare cliff behind a seawall reclaiming acres ha of land this land was then made into the samphire hoe country park environmental impact assessment did not identify any major risks for the project and further studies into safety noise and air pollution were overall positive however environmental objections were raised over a high speed link to london successful tunnelling required a sound understanding of the topography and geology and the selection of the best rock strata through which to dig the geology of this site generally consists of northeasterly dipping cretaceous strata part of the northern limb of the wealden boulonnais dome characteristics include on the english side the stratum dip is less than on the french side this increases to jointing and faulting are present on both sides on the english side only minor faults of displacement less than metres ft exist on the french side displacements of up to metres ft are present owing to the quenocs anticlinal fold the faults are of limited width filled with calcite pyrite and remoulded clay the increased dip and faulting restricted the selection of route on the french side to avoid confusion microfossil assemblages were used to classify the chalk marl on the french side particularly near the coast the chalk was harder more brittle and more fractured than on the english side this led to the adoption of different tunnelling techniques on the two sides the quaternary undersea valley fosse dangaered and castle hill landslip at the english portal caused concerns identified by the geophysical survey the fosse dangaered is an infilled valley system extending metres ft below the seabed metres ft south of the tunnel route in mid channel a survey showed that a tributary crossed the path of the tunnel and so the tunnel route was made as far north and deep as possible the english terminal had to be located in the castle hill landslip which consists of displaced and tipping blocks of lower chalk glauconitic marl and gault debris thus the area was stabilised by buttressing and inserting drainage adits the service tunnel acted as a pilot preceding the main ones so that the geology areas of crushed rock and zones of high water inflow could be predicted exploratory probing took place in the service tunnel in the form of extensive forward probing vertical downward probes and sideways probing marine soundings and samplings by thom de gamond were carried out during establishing the seabed depth at a maximum of metres ft and the continuity of geological strata layers surveying continued over many years with marine and land deep boreholes being drilled and over line kilometres of marine geophysical survey completed surveys were undertaken in and the surveying in catered for immersed tube and bridge designs as well as a bored tunnel and thus a wide area was investigated at this time marine geophysics surveying for engineering projects was in its infancy with poor positioning and resolution from seismic profiling the surveys concentrated on a northerly route that left the english coast at dover harbour using boreholes an area of deeply weathered rock with high permeability was located just south of dover harbour given the previous survey results and access constraints a more southerly route was investigated in the survey and the route was confirmed to be feasible information for the tunnelling project also came from work before the cancellation on the french side at sangatte a deep shaft with adits was made on the english side at shakespeare cliff the government allowed metres ft of metre ft diameter tunnel to be driven the actual tunnel alignment method of excavation and support were essentially the same as the attempt in the survey previous findings were reinforced and the characteristics of the gault clay and the tunnelling medium chalk marl that made up of the route were investigated geophysical techniques from the oil industry were employed tunnelling was a major engineering challenge with the only precedent being the undersea seikan tunnel in japan which opened in a serious health and safety risk with building tunnels underwater is major water inflow due to the high hydrostatic pressure from the sea above under weak ground conditions the tunnel also had the challenge of time being privately funded early financial return was paramount the objective was to construct two metre diameter ft rail tunnels metres ft apart kilometres mi in length a metre diameter ft service tunnel between the two main ones pairs of metre diameter ft cross passages linking the rail tunnels to the service one at metre ft spacing piston relief ducts metres ft in diameter connecting the rail tunnels metres ft apart two undersea crossover caverns to connect the rail tunnels with the service tunnel always preceding the main ones by at least kilometre mi to ascertain the ground conditions there was plenty of experience with excavating through chalk in the mining industry while the undersea crossover caverns were a complex engineering problem the french one was based on the mount baker ridge freeway tunnel in seattle the uk cavern was dug from the service tunnel ahead of the main ones to avoid delay precast segmental linings in the main tbm drives were used but two different solutions were used on the french side neoprene and grout sealed bolted linings made of cast iron or high strength reinforced concrete were used on the english side the main requirement was for speed so bolting of cast iron lining segments was only carried out in areas of poor geology in the uk rail tunnels eight lining segments plus a key segment were used in the french side five segments plus a key on the french side a metre ft diameter metre ft deep grout curtained shaft at sangatte was used for access on the english side a marshalling area was metres ft below the top of shakespeare cliff the new austrian tunnelling method natm was first applied in the chalk marl here on the english side the land tunnels were driven from shakespeare cliff same place as the marine tunnels not from folkestone the platform at the base of the cliff was not large enough for all of the drives and despite environmental objections tunnel spoil was placed behind a reinforced concrete seawall on condition of placing the chalk in an enclosed lagoon to avoid wide dispersal of chalk fines owing to limited space the precast lining factory was on the isle of grain in the thames estuary which used scottish granite aggregate delivered by ship from the foster yeoman coastal super quarry at glensanda in loch linnhe on the west coast of scotland on the french side owing to the greater permeability to water earth pressure balance tbms with open and closed modes were used the tbms were of a closed nature during the initial kilometres mi but then operated as open boring through the chalk marl stratum this minimised the impact to the ground allowed high water pressures to be withstood and it also alleviated the need to grout ahead of the tunnel the french effort required five tbms two main marine machines one main land machine the short land drives of km mi allowed one tbm to complete the first drive then reverse direction and complete the other and two service tunnel machines on the english side the simpler geology allowed faster open faced tbms six machines were used all commenced digging from shakespeare cliff three marine bound and three for the land tunnels towards the completion of the undersea drives the uk tbms were driven steeply downwards and buried clear of the tunnel these buried tbms were then used to provide an electrical earth the french tbms then completed the tunnel and were dismantled a mm in gauge railway was used on the english side during construction in contrast to the english machines which were given technical names the french tunnelling machines were all named after women brigitte europa catherine virginie pascaline s verine at the end of the tunnelling one machine was on display at the side of the m motorway in folkestone until eurotunnel sold it on ebay for to a scrap metal merchant another machine t virginie still survives on the french side adjacent to junction on the a in the middle of the d e d e roundabout on it are the words hommage aux b tisseurs du tunnel meaning tribute to the builders of the tunnel the eleven tunnel boring machines were designed and manufactured through a joint venture between the robbins company of kent washington united states markham co of chesterfield england and kawasaki heavy industries of japan the tbms for the service tunnels and main tunnels on the uk side were designed and manufactured by james howden company ltd scotland the loading gauge height is m ft in there are three communication systems concession radio cr for mobile vehicles and personnel within eurotunnel s concession terminals tunnels coastal shafts track to train radio ttr for secure speech and data between trains and the railway control centre shuttle internal radio sir for communication between shuttle crew and to passengers over car radios power is delivered to the locomotives via an overhead line catenary at kv hz with a normal overhead clearance of metres ft in all tunnel services run on electricity shared equally from english and french sources there are two sub stations fed at kv at each terminal but in an emergency the tunnel s lighting about light fittings and plant can be powered solely from either england or france the traditional railway south of london uses a v dc third rail to deliver electricity but since the opening of high speed there is no longer any need for tunnel trains to use the third rail system high speed the tunnel and the lgv nord all have power provided via overhead catenary at kv hz the railways on classic lines in belgium are also electrified by overhead wires but at v dc a cab signalling system gives information directly to train drivers on a display there is a train protection system that stops the train if the speed exceeds that indicated on the in cab display tvm as used on lgv nord and high speed is used in the tunnel the tvm signalling is interconnected with the signalling on the high speed lines either side allowing trains to enter and exit the tunnel system without stopping the maximum speed is km h signalling in the tunnel is coordinated from two control centres the main control centre at the folkestone terminal and a backup at the calais terminal which is staffed at all times and can take over all operations in the event of a breakdown or emergency conventional ballasted tunnel track was ruled out owing to the difficulty of maintenance and lack of stability and precision the sonneville international corporation s track system was chosen based on reliability and cost effectiveness based on good performance in swiss tunnels and worldwide the type of track used is known as low vibration track lvt like ballasted track the lvt is of the free floating type held in place by gravity and friction reinforced concrete blocks of kg support the rails every cm and are held by mm thick closed cell polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of rubber boots the latter separate the blocks mass movements from the lean encasement concrete ballastless track provides extra overhead clearance necessary for the passage of larger trains the corrugated rubber walls of the boots add a degree of isolation of horizontal wheel rail vibrations and are insulators of the track signal circuit in the humid tunnel environment uic kg m rails of a grade rest on mm in rail pads which fit the rn sonneville bolted dual leaf springs the rails lvt blocks and their boots with pads were assembled outside the tunnel in a fully automated process developed by the lvt inventor mr roger sonneville about sonneville blocks were made on the sangatte site maintenance activities are less than projected initially the rails were ground on a yearly basis or after approximately mgt of traffic ride quality continues to be noticeably smooth and of low noise maintenance is facilitated by the existence of two tunnel junctions or crossover facilities allowing for two way operation in each of the six tunnel segments thereby created and thus providing safe access for maintenance of one isolated tunnel segment at a time the two crossovers are the largest artificial undersea caverns ever built m long m high and m wide the english crossover is km mi from shakespeare cliff and the french crossover is km mi from sangatte the ventilation system maintains the air pressure in the service tunnel higher than in the rail tunnels so that in the event of a fire smoke does not enter the service tunnel from the rail tunnels two cooling water pipes in each rail tunnel circulate chilled water to remove heat generated by the rail traffic pumping stations remove water in the tunnels from rain seepage and so on during the design stage of the tunnel engineers found that its aerodynamic properties and the heat generated by high speed trains as they passed through it would raise the temperature inside the tunnel to c f as well as making the trains unbearably warm for passengers this also presented a risk of equipment failure and track distortion to cool the tunnel to below c f engineers installed kilometres mi of m in diameter cooling pipes carrying million litres million imperial gallons of water the network europe s largest cooling system was supplied by eight york titan chillers running on r a hydrochlorofluorocarbon hcfc refrigerant gas due to r s ozone depletion potential odp and high global warming potential gwp its use is being phased out in developed countries and since january it has been illegal in europe to use hcfcs to service air conditioning equipment broken equipment that used hcfcs must instead be replaced with equipment that does not use it in trane was selected to provide replacement chillers for the tunnel s cooling network the york chillers were decommissioned and four next generation trane series e centravac large capacity kw to kw chillers were installed two located in sangatte france and two at shakespeare cliff uk the energy efficient chillers using honeywell s non flammable ultra low gwp r zd e refrigerant maintain temperatures at c f and in their first year of operation generated savings of gwh approximately equating to for tunnel operator getlink initially le shuttle locomotives were commissioned with one at each end of a shuttle train car shuttle sets have two separate halves single and double deck each half has two loading unloading wagons and carrier wagons eurotunnel s original order was for nine car shuttle sets heavy goods vehicle hgv shuttle sets also have two halves with each half containing one loading wagon one unloading wagon and carrier wagons there is a club car behind the leading locomotive where drivers must stay during the journey eurotunnel originally ordered six hgv shuttle sets forty six class locomotives for hauling freight trains and overnight passenger trains the nightstar project which was abandoned were commissioned running on both overhead ac and third rail dc power however rff does not let these run on french railways so there are plans to certify alstom prima ii locomotives for use in the tunnel thirty one eurostar trains based on the french tgv built to uk loading gauge with many modifications for safety within the tunnel were commissioned with ownership split between british rail french national railways sncf and belgian national railways nmbs sncb british rail ordered seven more for services north of london around eurostar ordered ten trains from siemens based on its velaro product the class entered service in and have been operating through the channel tunnel ever since alongside the current class germany db has since around tried to get permission to run train services to london at the end of extensive fire proofing requirements were dropped and db received permission to run german intercity express ice test trains through the tunnel in june db was granted access to the tunnel but these plans were ultimately dropped in october renfe the spanish state railway company expressed interest in operating a cross channel route between paris and london using some of their existing trains with the intention of competing with eurostar no details have been revealed as to which trains would be used diesel locomotives for rescue and shunting work are eurotunnel class and eurotunnel class the following chart presents the estimated number of passengers and tonnes of freight respectively annually transported through the channel tunnel since m million citation needed transport services offered by the tunnel are as follows both the freight and passenger traffic forecasts that led to the construction of the tunnel were overestimated in particular eurotunnel s commissioned forecasts were over predictions although the captured share of channel crossings was forecast correctly high competition especially from budget airlines which expanded rapidly in the s and s and reduced tariffs led to low revenue overall cross channel traffic was overestimated with the eu s liberalisation of international rail services the tunnel and high speed have been open to competition since there have been a number of operators interested in running trains through the tunnel and along high speed to london in june after several years db obtained a licence to operate frankfurt london trains not expected to run before because of delivery delays of the custom made trains plans for the service to frankfurt seem to have been shelved in cross tunnel passenger traffic volumes peaked at million in dropped to million in and has increased substantially since then at the time of the decision about building the tunnel million passengers were predicted for eurostar trains in the opening year in the first full year actual numbers were a little over million growing to million in then dropping to million in eurostar was initially limited by the lack of a high speed connection on the british side after the completion of high speed in two stages in and traffic increased in eurostar carried passengers a increase over the previous year despite traffic limitations due to the channel tunnel fire eurostar passenger numbers continued to increase a only passengers taking eurostar to cross the channel freight volumes have been erratic with a major decrease during due to a closure caused by a fire in a freight shuttle freight crossings increased over the period indicating the substitutability of the tunnel by sea crossings the tunnel has achieved a market share close to or above eurotunnel s s predictions but eurotunnel s and predictions were overestimates citation needed for through freight trains the first year prediction was million tonnes the actual figure was m tonnes through freight volumes peaked in at m tonnes this fell back to m tonnes in increasing slightly to m tonnes in together with that carried on freight shuttles freight growth has occurred since opening with m tonnes carried in m tonnes recorded in and m tonnes in numbers fell back in the wake of the fire eurotunnel s freight subsidiary is europorte in september ews the uk s largest rail freight operator announced that owing to cessation of uk french government subsidies of million per annum to cover the tunnel minimum user charge a subsidy of around per train at a traffic level of trains per annum freight trains would stop running after november shares in eurotunnel were issued at per share on december by mid the price had risen to delays and cost overruns led to the price dropping during demonstration runs in october it reached an all time low eurotunnel suspended payment on its debt in september to avoid bankruptcy in december the british and french governments extended eurotunnel s operating concession by years to financial restructuring of eurotunnel occurred in mid reducing debt and financial charges despite the restructuring the economist reported in that to break even eurotunnel would have to increase fares traffic and market share for sustainability a cost benefit analysis of the tunnel indicated that there were few impacts on the wider economy and few developments associated with the project and that the british economy would have been better off if it had not been constructed under the terms of the concession eurotunnel was obliged to investigate a cross channel road tunnel in december road and rail tunnel proposals were presented to the british and french governments but it was stressed that there was not enough demand for a second tunnel a three way treaty between the united kingdom france and belgium governs border controls with the establishment of control zones wherein the officers of the other nation may exercise limited customs and law enforcement powers for most purposes these are at either end of the tunnel with the french border controls on the uk side of the tunnel and vice versa for some city to city trains the train is a control zone a binational emergency plan coordinates uk and french emergency activities in eurostar posted its first net profit having made a loss of m in in eurotunnel was described as being in a serious situation in operating profits rose percent from to million there is a need for full passport controls since this is the border between the schengen area and the common travel area there are juxtaposed controls meaning that passports are checked before boarding first by officials belonging to departing country and then officials of the destination country these are placed only at the main eurostar stations french officials operate at london st pancras ebbsfleet international and ashford international while british officials operate at calais fr thun lille europe marne la vall e chessy brussels south and paris gare du nord there are security checks before boarding as well for the shuttle road vehicle trains there are juxtaposed passport controls before boarding the trains for eurostar trains travelling from places south of paris there is no passport and security check before departure and those trains must stop in lille at least minutes to allow all passengers to be checked no checks are done on board there have been plans for services from amsterdam frankfurt and cologne to london but a major reason to cancel them was the need for a stop in lille a direct service from london to amsterdam started on april following the building of check in terminals at amsterdam and rotterdam and intergovernmental agreement a direct service from the two dutch cities to london started on april the terminals sites are at cheriton near folkestone in the united kingdom and coquelles near calais in france the uk site uses the m motorway for access the terminals are organised with the frontier controls juxtaposed with the entry to the system to allow travellers to go onto the motorway at the destination country immediately after leaving the shuttle to achieve design output at the french terminal the shuttles accept cars on double deck wagons for flexibility ramps were placed inside the shuttles to provide access to the top decks at folkestone there are kilometres mi of main line track turnouts and eight platforms at calais there are kilometres mi of track and turnouts at the terminals the shuttle trains traverse a figure eight to reduce uneven wear on the wheels there is a freight marshalling yard west of cheriton at dollands moor freight yard a report from the european commission predicted that kent and nord pas de calais had to face increased traffic volumes due to general growth of cross channel traffic and traffic attracted by the tunnel in kent a high speed rail line to london would transfer traffic from road to rail kent s regional development would benefit from the tunnel but being so close to london restricts the benefits gains are in the traditional industries and are largely dependent on the development of ashford international railway station without which kent would be totally dependent on london s expansion nord pas de calais enjoys a strong internal symbolic effect of the tunnel which results in significant gains in manufacturing the removal of a bottleneck by means like the tunnel does not necessarily induce economic gains in all adjacent regions the image of a region being connected to the european high speed transport and active political response are more important for regional economic development some small medium enterprises located in the immediate vicinity of the terminal have used the opportunity to re brand the profile of their business with positive effect such as the new inn at etchinghill which was able to commercially exploit its unique selling point as being the closest pub to the channel tunnel tunnel induced regional development is small compared to general economic growth the south east of england is likely to benefit developmentally and socially from faster and cheaper transport to continental europe but the benefits are unlikely to be equally distributed throughout the region the overall environmental impact is almost certainly negative since the opening of the tunnel small positive impacts on the wider economy have been felt but it is difficult to identify major economic successes directly attributed to the tunnel the eurotunnel does operate profitably offering an alternative transportation mode unaffected by poor weather high costs of construction did delay profitability however and companies involved in the tunnel s construction and operation early in operation relied on government aid to deal with the accumulated debt illegal immigrants and would be asylum seekers have used the tunnel to attempt to enter britain by the problem had attracted international press attention and by the french red cross opened the first migrant centre at sangatte using a warehouse once used for tunnel construction by it housed up to people at a time most of them trying to get to the uk in most came from afghanistan iraq and iran but african countries were also represented eurotunnel the company that operates the crossing said that more than migrants were intercepted between january and july approximately migrants mainly from ethiopia eritrea sudan and afghanistan were living in the temporary camps erected in calais at the time of an official count in july an estimated to migrants were waiting in calais for a chance to get to england britain and france operate a system of juxtaposed controls on immigration and customs where investigations happen before travel france is part of the schengen immigration zone removing border checks in normal times between most eu member states britain and the republic of ireland form their own separate common travel area immigration zone most illegal immigrants and would be asylum seekers who got into britain found some way to ride a freight train trucks are loaded onto freight trains in a few instances migrants stowed away in a liquid chocolate tanker and managed to survive spread across several attempts although the facilities were fenced airtight security was deemed impossible migrants would even jump from bridges onto moving trains in several incidents people were injured during the crossing others tampered with railway equipment causing delays and requiring repairs eurotunnel said it was losing m per month because of the problem in and several riots broke out at sangatte and groups of migrants up to in a december incident stormed the fences and attempted to enter en masse other migrants seeking permanent uk settlement use the eurostar passenger train they may purport to be visitors whether to be issued with a required visit visa or deny and falsify their true intentions to obtain a maximum of months in a year at port stamp purport to be someone else whose documents they hold or used forged or counterfeit passports such breaches will result in refusal of permission to enter the uk effected by border force after such a person s identity is fully established assuming they persist in their application to enter the uk local authorities in both france and the uk called for the closure of the sangatte migrant camp and eurotunnel twice sought an injunction against the centre as at the united kingdom blamed france for allowing sangatte to open and france blamed both the uk for its then lax asylum rules law and the eu for not having a uniform immigration policy the cause c l bre nature of the problem even included journalists detained as they followed migrants onto railway property in after the european commission told france that it was in breach of european union rules on the free transfer of goods because of the delays and closures as a result of its poor security a double fence was built at a cost of million reducing the numbers of migrants detected each week reaching britain on goods trains from to almost none other measures included cctv cameras and increased police patrols at the end of the sangatte centre was closed after the uk agreed to absorb some migrants on and june striking workers associated with myferrylink damaged the sections of track by burning car tires leading to all trains being cancelled and a backlog of vehicles hundreds seeking to reach britain made use of the situation to attempt to stow away inside and underneath transport trucks destined for the united kingdom extra security measures included a million upgrade of detection technology million extra for dog searches and million over three years towards a joint fund with france for security surrounding the port of calais in a dozen migrants died in crossing attempts in the two months from june to july ten migrants died near the french tunnel terminal during a period when attempts to evade security precautions were being made each day on july a migrant died while attempting to climb onto a freight train while trying to reach britain from the french side of the channel the previous month an eritrean man was killed under similar circumstances during the night of july one person aged was found dead after a night in which migrants had attempted to enter the eurotunnel terminal the body of a sudanese migrant was subsequently found inside the tunnel on august another sudanese migrant walked nearly the entire length of one of the tunnels he was arrested close to the british side after having walked about miles km through the tunnel there have been three fires in the tunnel all on the heavy goods vehicle hgv shuttles that were significant enough to close the tunnel as well as other more minor incidents on december during an invitation only testing phase a fire broke out in a ford escort car while its owner was loading it onto the upper deck of a tourist shuttle the fire started at about with the shuttle train stationary in the folkestone terminal and was put out about minutes later with no passenger injuries on november a fire broke out on an hgv shuttle wagon in the tunnel but nobody was seriously hurt the exact cause is unknown although it was neither a eurotunnel equipment nor rolling stock problem it may have been due to arson of a heavy goods vehicle it is estimated that the heart of the fire reached c f with the tunnel severely damaged over metres ft with some metres ft affected to some extent full operation recommenced six months after the fire on august the tunnel was closed for several hours when a truck on an hgv shuttle train caught fire on september a fire occurred in the channel tunnel at gmt the incident started on an hgv shuttle train travelling towards france the event occurred kilometres mi from the french entrance to the tunnel no one was killed but several people were taken to hospitals suffering from smoke inhalation and minor cuts and bruises the tunnel was closed to all traffic with the undamaged south tunnel reopening for limited services two days later full service resumed on february after repairs costing million on november the tunnel was closed for several hours after a truck on an hgv shuttle caught fire on january both tunnels were closed following a lorry fire which filled the midsection of running tunnel north with smoke eurostar cancelled all services the shuttle train had been heading from folkestone to coquelles and stopped adjacent to cross passage cp just before utc thirty eight passengers and four members of eurotunnel staff were evacuated into the service tunnel and then transported to france using special stts road vehicles in the service tunnel the passengers and crew were taken to the eurotunnel fire emergency management centre close to the french portal on the night of february about passengers became trapped in the channel tunnel when eurostar trains from london broke down owing to failures of electronic circuits caused by snow and ice being deposited and then melting on the circuit boards on august an electrical failure lasting six hours caused passengers to be trapped in the tunnel on a shuttle on the evening of december during the december european snowfall five london bound eurostar trains failed inside the tunnel trapping passengers for approximately hours during the coldest temperatures in eight years a eurotunnel spokesperson explained that snow had evaded the train s winterisation shields and the transition from cold air outside to the tunnel s warm atmosphere had melted the snow resulting in electrical failures one train was turned back before reaching the tunnel two trains were hauled out of the tunnel by eurotunnel class diesel locomotives the blocking of the tunnel led to the implementation of operation stack the transformation of the m motorway into a linear car park the occasion was the first time that a eurostar train was evacuated inside the tunnel the failing of four at once was described as unprecedented the channel tunnel reopened the following morning nirj deva member of the european parliament for south east england had called for eurostar chief executive richard brown to resign over the incidents an independent report by christopher garnett former ceo of great north eastern railway and claude gressier a french transport expert on the december incidents was issued in february making recommendations on january a brussels london eurostar broke down in the tunnel the train had passengers on board and was towed to ashford other trains that had not yet reached the tunnel were turned back the channel tunnel safety authority is responsible for some aspects of safety regulation in the tunnel it reports to the intergovernmental commission igc the service tunnel is used for access to technical equipment in cross passages and equipment rooms to provide fresh air ventilation and for emergency evacuation the service tunnel transport system stts allows fast access to all areas of the tunnel the service vehicles are rubber tyred with a buried wire guidance system the stts vehicles are used mainly for maintenance but also for firefighting and in emergencies pods with different purposes up to a payload of tonnes tons are inserted into the side of the vehicles the vehicles cannot turn around within the tunnel and are driven from either end the maximum speed is km h mph when the steering is locked a fleet of light service tunnel vehicles ladogs was introduced to supplement the sttss the ladogs have a short wheelbase with a m ft turning circle allowing two point turns within the service tunnel steering cannot be locked like the stts vehicles and maximum speed is km h mph pods up to tonne tons can be loaded onto the rear of the vehicles drivers in the tunnel sit on the right and the vehicles drive on the left owing to the risk of french personnel driving on their native right side of the road sensors in the vehicles alert the driver if the vehicle strays to the right side the three tunnels contain tonnes tons of air that needs to be conditioned for comfort and safety air is supplied from ventilation buildings at shakespeare cliff and sangatte with each building capable of providing standby capacity supplementary ventilation also exists on either side of the tunnel in the event of a fire ventilation is used to keep smoke out of the service tunnel and move smoke in one direction in the main tunnel to give passengers clean air the tunnel was the first main line railway tunnel to have special cooling equipment heat is generated from traction equipment and drag the design limit was set at c f using a mechanical cooling system with refrigeration plants on both sides that run chilled water circulating in pipes within the tunnel trains travelling at high speed create piston effect pressure changes that can affect passenger comfort ventilation systems tunnel doors fans and the structure of the trains and which drag on the trains piston relief ducts of metre ft diameter were chosen to solve the problem with ducts per kilometre to give close to optimum results however this design led to extreme lateral forces on the trains so a reduction in train speed was required and restrictors were installed in the ducts the safety issue of a possible fire on a passenger vehicle shuttle garnered much attention with eurotunnel noting that fire was the risk attracting the most attention in a safety case for three reasons the opposition of ferry companies to passengers being allowed to remain with their cars home office statistics indicating that car fires had doubled in ten years and the long length of the tunnel eurotunnel commissioned the uk fire research station now part of the building research establishment to give reports of vehicle fires and liaised with kent fire brigade to gather vehicle fire statistics over one year fire tests took place at the french mines research establishment with a mock wagon used to investigate how cars burned the wagon door systems are designed to withstand fire inside the wagon for minutes longer than the transit time of minutes wagon air conditioning units help to purge dangerous fumes from inside the wagon before travel each wagon has a fire detection and extinguishing system with sensing of ions or ultraviolet radiation smoke and gases that can trigger halon gas to quench a fire since the hgv wagons are not covered fire sensors are located on the loading wagon and in the tunnel a inch mm water main in the service tunnel provides water to the main tunnels at metre ft intervals the ventilation system can control smoke movement special arrival sidings accept a train that is on fire as the train is not allowed to stop whilst on fire in the tunnel unless continuing its journey would lead to a worse outcome eurotunnel has banned a wide range of hazardous goods from travelling in the tunnel two stts service tunnel transportation system vehicles with firefighting pods are on duty at all times with a maximum delay of minutes before they reach a burning train in the kosovo train for life passed through the tunnel en route to pristina in kosovo in former f racing champion john surtees drove a ginetta g ev electric sports car prototype from england to france using the service tunnel as part of a charity event he was required to keep to the kilometre per hour mph speed limit to celebrate the tour de france s transfer from its opening stages in britain to france in july of that year chris froome of team sky rode a bicycle through the service tunnel becoming the first solo rider to do so the crossing took under an hour reaching speeds of kilometres per hour mph faster than most cross channel ferries since french operators bouygues telecom orange and sfr have covered running tunnel south the tunnel bore normally used for travel from france to britain in january uk operators ee and vodafone signed ten year contracts with eurotunnel for running tunnel north the agreements will enable both operators subscribers to use g and g services both ee and vodafone planned to offer lte services on the route ee said it expected to cover the route with lte connectivity by summer ee and vodafone will offer channel tunnel network coverage for travellers from the uk to france eurotunnel said it also held talks with three uk but has yet to reach an agreement with the operator in may eurotunnel announced that they had installed equipment from alcatel lucent to cover running tunnel north and simultaneously to provide mobile service gsm mhz and umts mhz by ee o and vodafone the service of ee and vodafone commenced on the same date as the announcement o service was expected to be available soon afterwards in november ee announced that it had previously switched on lte earlier in september o turned on g g and g services in november whilst vodafone s g was due to go live later the tunnel also houses the mw eleclink interconnector to transfer power between the british and french electricity networks during the night august september the km long kv dc cable was switched into service for the first time

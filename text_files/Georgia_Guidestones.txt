guidestones in eight different languages one language on each face of the four large upright stones moving clockwise around the structure from due north these languages were english spanish swahili hindi hebrew arabic traditional chinese and russian the languages were chosen because they represented most of humanity except for hebrew which was chosen because of its connections to judaism and

dealt with four main themes governance and the establishment of a world government population and reproduction control the environment and humankind s relationship to nature and spirituality the

various facts about the size weight and astronomical features of the stones the date it was installed and the sponsors of the project it referred to a time capsule buried under the tablet but blank spaces on the stone intended for filling in the dates on which the capsule was buried and was to be opened had not been inscribed so it was uncertain if the time capsule was ever actually put in place

unveiling of the monument a local minister proclaimed that he believed that the monument was for sun worshipers for cult worship and for devil worship conspiracy theorist jay weidner has said that the pseudonym of the man who commissioned the stones r c christian resembles rose cross christian or christian rosenkreuz the founder of the rosicrucian order others who agree with weidner point to the rosicrucian s first manifesto written in which states the word r c should be their seal mark and character they also see similarities between the writing on the capstone and the title of rosicrucian thomas paine s the age of reason

 borobudur also transcribed barabudur indonesian candi borobudur javanese romanized candhi barabudhur is a th century mahayana buddhist temple in magelang regency not far from the town of muntilan in central java indonesia it is the world s largest buddhist temple the temple consists of nine stacked platforms six square and three circular topped by a central dome it is decorated with relief panels and originally buddha statues the central dome is surrounded by buddha statues each seated inside a perforated stupa built in the th century during the reign of the sailendra dynasty the temple design follows javanese buddhist architecture which blends the indonesian indigenous tradition of ancestor worship and the buddhist concept of attaining nirv a the temple demonstrates the influences of gupta art that reflects india s influence on the region yet there are enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make borobudur uniquely indonesian the monument is a shrine to the buddha and a place for buddhist pilgrimage the pilgrim journey begins at the base of the monument and follows a path around the monument ascending to the top through three levels symbolic of buddhist cosmology k madh tu the world of desire r padh tu the world of forms and ar padh tu the world of formlessness the monument guides pilgrims through an extensive system of stairways and corridors with narrative relief panels on the walls and the balustrades borobudur has one of the largest and most complete ensembles of buddhist reliefs in the world evidence suggests that borobudur was constructed in the th century and subsequently abandoned following the th century decline of hindu kingdoms in java and the javanese conversion to islam worldwide knowledge of its existence was sparked in by sir thomas stamford raffles then the british ruler of java who was advised of its location by native indonesians borobudur has since been preserved through several restorations the largest restoration project was undertaken between and by the indonesian government and unesco followed by the monument s listing as a unesco world heritage site borobudur is the largest buddhist temple in the world and ranks with bagan in myanmar and angkor wat in cambodia as one of the great archeological sites of southeast asia borobudur remains popular for pilgrimage with buddhists in indonesia celebrating vesak day at the monument borobudur is indonesia s single most visited tourist attraction in indonesian ancient temples are referred to as candi thus locals refer to borobudur temple as candi borobudur the term candi also loosely describes ancient structures for example gates and baths the origins of the name borobudur is derived from boro for big and budur for buddha the name borobudur was first written in raffles s book on javan history raffles wrote about a monument called borobudur but there are no older documents suggesting the same name the only old javanese manuscript that hints the monument called budur as a holy buddhist sanctuary is nagarakretagama written by mpu prapanca a buddhist scholar of majapahit court in most candi are named after a nearby village if it followed javanese language conventions and was named after the nearby village of bore the monument should have been named budurboro raffles thought that budur might correspond to the modern javanese word buda ancient i e ancient boro he also suggested that the name might derive from boro meaning great or honourable and budur for buddha however another archaeologist suggests the second component of the name budur comes from javanese term bhudhara mountain another possible etymology by dutch archaeologist a j bernet kempers suggests that borobudur is a corrupted simplified local javanese pronunciation of biara beduhur written in sanskrit as vihara buddha uhr the term buddha uhr could mean the city of buddhas while another possible term beduhur is probably an old javanese term still survived today in balinese vocabulary which means a high place constructed from the stem word dhuhur or luhur high this suggests that borobudur means vihara of buddha located on a high place or on a hill the construction and inauguration of a sacred buddhist building possibly a reference to borobudur was mentioned in two inscriptions both discovered in kedu temanggung regency the karangtengah inscription dated mentioned a sacred building named jinalaya the realm of those who have conquered worldly desire and reached enlightenment inaugurated by pramodhawardhani daughter of samaratungga the tri tepusan inscription dated is mentioned in the sima the tax free lands awarded by r kahulunnan pramodhawardhani to ensure the funding and maintenance of a kam l n called bh misambh ra kam l n is from the word mula which means the place of origin a sacred building to honor the ancestors probably those of the sailendras casparis suggested that bh mi sambh ra bhudh ra which in sanskrit means the mountain of combined virtues of the ten stages of boddhisattvahood was the original name of borobudur approximately kilometres mi northwest of yogyakarta and kilometres mi west of surakarta borobudur is located in an elevated area between two twin volcanoes sundoro sumbing and merbabu merapi and two rivers the progo and the elo according to local myth the area known as kedu plain is a javanese sacred place and has been dubbed the garden of java due to its high agricultural fertility during the restoration in the early th century it was discovered that three buddhist temples in the region borobudur pawon and mendut are positioned along a straight line a ritual relationship between the three temples must have existed although the exact ritual process is unknown speculation about a surrounding lake s existence was the subject of intense discussion among archaeologists in the th century in a dutch artist and scholar of hindu and buddhist architecture w o j nieuwenkamp developed a hypothesis that the kedu plain was once a lake and borobudur initially represented a lotus flower floating on the lake it has been claimed that borobudur was built on a bedrock hill m ft above sea level and m ft above the floor of a dried out paleolake dumar ay together with professor thanikaimoni took soil samples in and again in from trial trenches that had been dug into the hill as well as from the plain immediately to the south these samples were later analysed by thanikaimoni who examined their pollen and spore content to identify the type of vegetation that had grown in the area around the time of borobudur s construction they were unable to discover any pollen or spore samples that were characteristic of any vegetation known to grow in an aquatic environment such as a lake pond or marsh the area surrounding borobudur appears to have been surrounded by agricultural land and palm trees at the time of the monument s construction as is still the case today caesar vo te and the geomorphologist dr j j nossin in field studies re examined the borobudur lake hypothesis and confirmed the absence of a lake around borobudur at the time of its construction and active use as a sanctuary these findings a new perspective on some old questions pertaining to borobudur were published in the unesco publication titled the restoration of borobudur there are no known records of construction or the intended purpose of borobudur the duration of construction has been estimated by comparison of carved reliefs on the temple s hidden foot and the inscriptions commonly used in royal charters during the th and th centuries borobudur was likely founded around ad this corresponds to the period between and ad the peak of the sailendra dynasty rule over the mataram kingdom in central java when their power encompassed not only the srivijayan empire but also southern thailand indianized kingdoms of philippines north malaya kedah also known in indian texts as the ancient hindu state of kadaram the construction has been estimated to have taken years with completion during the reign of samaratungga in there is uncertainty about hindu and buddhist rulers in java around that time the sailendras were known as ardent followers of buddhism though stone inscriptions found at sojomerto also suggest they may have been hindus it was during this time that many hindu and buddhist monuments were built on the plains and mountains around the kedu plain the buddhist monuments including borobudur were erected around the same period as the hindu shiva prambanan temple compound in ad the shivaite king sanjaya commissioned a shivalinga sanctuary to be built on the wukir hill only km mi east of borobudur construction of buddhist temples including borobudur at that time was possible because sanjaya s immediate successor rakai panangkaran granted his permission to the buddhist followers to build such temples in fact to show his respect panangkaran gave the village of kalasan to the buddhist community as is written in the kalasan charter dated ad this has led some archaeologists to believe that there was never serious conflict concerning religion in java as it was possible for a hindu king to patronize the establishment of a buddhist monument or for a buddhist king to act likewise the battle on the ratubaka plateau was much after and was a political battle there was a climate of peaceful coexistence where sailendra involvement exists in lara jonggrang borobudur lay hidden for centuries under layers of volcanic ash and jungle growth the facts behind its abandonment remain a mystery it is not known when active use of the monument and buddhist pilgrimage to it ceased sometime between and king mpu sindok moved the capital of the mataram kingdom to the region of east java after a series of volcanic eruptions it is not certain whether this influenced the abandonment but several sources mention this as the most likely period of abandonment the monument is mentioned vaguely as late as c in mpu prapanca s nagarakretagama written during the majapahit era and mentioning the vihara in budur soekmono also mentions the popular belief that the temples were disbanded when the population converted to islam in the th century the monument was not forgotten completely though folk stories gradually shifted from its past glory into more superstitious beliefs associated with bad luck and misery two old javanese chronicles babad from the th century mention cases of bad luck associated with the monument according to the babad tanah jawi or the history of java the monument was a fatal factor for mas dana a rebel who revolted against pakubuwono i the king of mataram in it was mentioned that the redi borobudur hill was besieged and the insurgents were defeated and sentenced to death by the king in the babad mataram or the history of the mataram kingdom the monument was associated with the misfortune of the crown prince of the yogyakarta sultanate in in spite of a taboo against visiting the monument he took such pity on the knight who was captured in a cage i e the statue in one of the perforated stupas that he could not help coming to see his unfortunate friend upon returning to his palace he fell ill and died one day later following its capture java was under british administration from to the appointed governor was lieutenant governor general thomas stamford raffles who took great interest in the history of java he collected javanese antiques and made notes through contacts with local inhabitants during his tour throughout the island on an inspection tour to semarang in he was informed about a big monument deep in a jungle near the village of bumisegoro he was not able to see the site himself but sent hermann cornelius nl a dutch engineer who among other antiquity explorations had uncovered the sewu complex in to investigate in two months cornelius and his men cut down trees burned down vegetation and dug away the earth to reveal the monument due to the danger of collapse he could not unearth all galleries he reported his findings to raffles including various drawings although raffles mentioned the discovery and hard work by cornelius and his men in only a few sentences he has been credited with the monument s rediscovery as the one who had brought it to the world s attention christiaan lodewijk hartmann the resident of the kedu region continued cornelius s work and in the whole complex was finally unearthed his interest in borobudur was more personal than official hartmann did not write any reports of his activities in particular the alleged story that he discovered the large statue of buddha in the main stupa in hartmann investigated the main dome although what he discovered is unknown and the main stupa remains empty the dutch east indies government then commissioned frans carel wilsen a dutch engineering official who studied the monument and drew hundreds of relief sketches jan frederik gerrit brumund was also appointed to make a detailed study of the monument which was completed in the government intended to publish an article based on brumund s study supplemented by wilsen s drawings but brumund refused to cooperate the government then commissioned another scholar conradus leemans who compiled a monograph based on brumund s and wilsen s sources in the first monograph of the detailed study of borobudur was published followed by its french translation a year later the first photograph of the monument was taken in by the dutch flemish engraver isidore van kinsbergen appreciation of the site developed slowly and it served for some time largely as a source of souvenirs and income for souvenir hunters and thieves in the chief inspector of cultural artifacts recommended that borobudur be entirely disassembled with the relocation of reliefs into museums due to the unstable condition of the monument as a result the government appointed willem pieter groeneveldt curator of the archaeological collection of the batavian society of arts and sciences to undertake a thorough investigation of the site and to assess the actual condition of the complex his report found that these fears were unjustified and recommended it be left intact borobudur was considered as the source of souvenirs and parts of its sculptures were looted some even with colonial government consent in king chulalongkorn of siam visited java and requested and was allowed to take home eight cartloads of sculptures taken from borobudur these include thirty pieces taken from a number of relief panels five buddha images two lions one gargoyle several kala motifs from the stairs and gateways and a guardian statue dvarapala several of these artifacts most notably the lions dvarapala kala makara and giant waterspouts are now on display in the java art room in the national museum in bangkok borobudur attracted attention in when the dutch engineer jan willem ijzerman id nl chairman of the archaeological society in yogyakarta made a discovery about the hidden foot photographs that reveal reliefs on the hidden foot were made in the discovery led the dutch east indies government to take steps to safeguard the monument in the government set up a commission consisting of three officials to assess the monument jan lourens andries brandes an art historian theodoor van erp nl a dutch army engineer officer and benjamin willem van de kamer a construction engineer from the department of public works in the commission submitted a threefold plan of proposal to the government first the immediate dangers should be avoided by resetting the corners removing stones that endangered the adjacent parts strengthening the first balustrades and restoring several niches archways stupas and the main dome second after fencing off the courtyards proper maintenance should be provided and drainage should be improved by restoring floors and spouts third all loose stones should be removed the monument cleared up to the first balustrades disfigured stones removed and the main dome restored the total cost was estimated at that time around dutch guilders the restoration then was carried out between and using the principles of anastylosis and led by theodor van erp the first seven months of restoration were occupied with excavating the grounds around the monument to find missing buddha heads and panel stones van erp dismantled and rebuilt the upper three circular platforms and stupas along the way van erp discovered more things he could do to improve the monument he submitted another proposal which was approved with the additional cost of guilders at first glance borobudur had been restored to its old glory van erp went further by carefully reconstructing the chattra three tiered parasol pinnacle on top of the main stupa however he later dismantled the chattra citing that there were not enough original stones used in reconstructing the pinnacle which means that the original design of borobudur s pinnacle is actually unknown the dismantled chattra now is stored in karmawibhangga museum a few hundred meters north from borobudur due to the limited budget the restoration had been primarily focused on cleaning the sculptures and van erp did not solve the drainage problem within fifteen years the gallery walls were sagging and the reliefs showed signs of new cracks and deterioration van erp used concrete from which alkali salts and calcium hydroxide leached and were transported into the rest of the construction this caused some problems so that a further thorough renovation was urgently needed small restorations had been performed since then but not sufficient for complete protection during world war ii and indonesian national revolution in to borobudur restoration efforts were halted the monument suffered further from the weather and drainage problems which caused the earth core inside the temple to expand pushing the stone structure and tilting the walls by s some parts of borobudur were facing imminent danger of collapsing in indonesia asked the unesco for advice on ways to counteract the problem of weathering at borobudur and other monuments in professor soekmono then head of the archeological service of indonesia launched his save borobudur campaign in an effort to organize a massive restoration project in the late s the indonesian government had requested from the international community a major renovation to protect the monument in a master plan to restore borobudur was created through an agreement concerning the voluntary contributions to be given for the execution of the project to preserve borobudur paris january countries agreed to contribute to the restoration australia aud belgium bef fr cyprus cyp france usd and germany dem dm the indonesian government and unesco then undertook the complete overhaul of the monument in a big restoration project between and in the actual work began over one million stones were dismantled and removed during the restoration and set aside like pieces of a massive jig saw puzzle to be individually identified catalogued cleaned and treated for preservation borobudur became a testing ground for new conservation techniques including new procedures to battle the microorganisms attacking the stone the foundation was stabilized and all panels were cleaned the restoration involved the dismantling of the five square platforms and the improvement of drainage by embedding water channels into the monument both impermeable and filter layers were added this colossal project involved around people to restore the monument and cost a total of us after the renovation was finished unesco listed borobudur as a world heritage site in it is listed under cultural criteria i to represent a masterpiece of human creative genius ii to exhibit an important interchange of human values over a span of time or within a cultural area of the world on developments in architecture or technology monumental arts town planning or landscape design and vi to be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions with ideas or with beliefs with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance in december the idea to reinstall chattra on top of borobudur main stupa s yasthi has been revisited however expert said a thorough study is needed on restoring the umbrella shaped pinnacle by early the chattra restoration has not yet commenced following the major renovation funded by unesco borobudur is once again used as a place of worship and pilgrimage once a year during the full moon in may or june buddhists in indonesia observe vesak indonesian waisak day commemorating the birth death and the time when siddh rtha gautama attained the highest wisdom to become the lord buddha waisak is an official national holiday in indonesia and the ceremony is centered at the three buddhist temples by walking from mendut to pawon and ending at borobudur the monument is the single most visited tourist attraction in indonesia in tourists of whom were foreigners visited the monument the figure climbed to million visitors annually were domestic tourists in the mid s before the country s economic crisis tourism development however has been criticized for not including the local community giving rise to occasional conflicts in residents and small businesses around borobudur organized several meetings and poetry protests objecting to a provincial government plan to build a three storey mall complex dubbed the java world international tourism awards were given to borobudur archaeological park such as pata grand pacific award pata gold award winner and pata gold award winner in june borobudur was recorded in the guinness book of world records as the world s largest buddhist archaeological site unesco identified three specific areas of concern under the present state of conservation i vandalism by visitors ii soil erosion in the south eastern part of the site and iii analysis and restoration of missing elements the soft soil the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure earthquakes are by far the most important contributing factors since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble but the earth itself can move in waves further destroying the structure the increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors most of whom are from indonesia despite warning signs on all levels not to touch anything the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem leading to further deterioration as of there is no system in place to limit the number of visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only in august the conservation authority of borobudur reported some severe abrasion of the stone stairs caused by the scraping of visitors footwear the conservation authority planned to install wooden stairs to cover and protect the original stone stairs just like those installed in angkor wat borobudur was heavily affected by the eruption of mount merapi in october and november volcanic ash from merapi fell on the temple complex which is approximately kilometres mi west southwest of the crater a layer of ash up to centimetres in thick fell on the temple statues during the eruption of november also killing nearby vegetation with experts fearing that the acidic ash might damage the historic site the temple complex was closed from to november to clean up the ashfall unesco donated us million as a part of the costs towards the rehabilitation of borobudur after mount merapi s eruption more than stone blocks comprising the temple s structure were dismantled to restore the drainage system which had been clogged by slurry after the rain the restoration was finished in november in january two german stone conservation experts spent ten days at the site analyzing the temples and making recommendations to ensure their long term preservation in june germany agreed to contribute to unesco for the second phase of rehabilitation in which six experts in stone conservation microbiology structural engineering and chemical engineering would spend a week in borobudur in june then return for another visit in september or october these missions would launch the preservation activities recommended in the january report and would include capacity building activities to enhance the preservation capabilities of governmental staff and young conservation experts on february major tourist attractions in yogyakarta and central java including borobudur prambanan and ratu boko were closed to visitors after being severely affected by the volcanic ash from the eruption of kelud volcano in east java located around kilometers east from yogyakarta workers covered the iconic stupas and statues of borobudur temple to protect the structure from volcanic ash the kelud volcano erupted on february with an explosion heard as far away as yogyakarta on january nine stupas were badly damaged by nine bombs in a blind muslim preacher husein ali al habsyie was sentenced to life imprisonment for masterminding a series of bombings in the mid s including the temple attack two other members of the islamic extremist group that carried out the bombings were each sentenced to years in and another man received a year prison term on may an earthquake of magnitude struck the south coast of central java the event caused severe damage around the region and casualties to the nearby city of yogyakarta and prambanan but borobudur remained intact in august indonesian police and security forces tightened the security in and around borobudur temple compound as a precaution to a threat posted on social media by a self proclaimed indonesian branch of isis citing that the terrorists planned to destroy borobudur and other statues in indonesia the security improvements included the repair and increased deployment of cctv monitors and the implementation of a night patrol in and around the temple compound the jihadist group follows a strict interpretation of islam that condemns any anthropomorphic representations such as sculptures as idolatry the high volume of visitors ascending the borobudur s narrow stairs has caused a severe wear out on the stone of the stairs eroding the stones surface and made them thinner and smoother overall borobudur has surfaces of stone stairs spread over four cardinal directions including the west side the east south and north there are around surfaces of them or about percent that are severely worn out to avoid further wear of stairs stones since november two main sections of borobudur stairs the eastern ascending route and northern descending route sides are covered with wooden structures the similar technique has been applied in angkor wat in cambodia and egyptian pyramids in march borobudur conservation center proposed further to seal the stairs with rubber cover proposals have also been made that visitors be issued special sandals the archaeological excavation into borobudur during reconstruction suggests that adherents of hinduism or a pre indic faith had already begun to erect a large structure on borobudur s hill before the site was appropriated by buddhists the foundations are unlike any hindu or buddhist shrine structures and therefore the initial structure is considered more indigenous javanese than hindu or buddhist borobudur is built as a single large stupa and when viewed from above takes the form of a giant tantric buddhist mandala simultaneously representing the buddhist cosmology and the nature of mind the original foundation is a square approximately metres ft on each side it has nine platforms of which the lower six are square and the upper three are circular the upper platform contains seventy two small stupas surrounding one large central stupa each stupa is bell shaped and pierced by numerous decorative openings statues of the buddha sit inside the pierced enclosures the design of borobudur took the form of a step pyramid previously the prehistoric austronesian megalithic culture in indonesia had constructed several earth mounds and stone step pyramid structures called punden berundak as discovered in pangguyangan site near cisolok and in cipari near kuningan the construction of stone pyramids is based on native beliefs that mountains and high places are the abode of ancestral spirits or hyangs the punden berundak step pyramid is the basic design in borobudur believed to be the continuation of older megalithic tradition incorporated with mahayana buddhist ideas and symbolism the monument s three divisions symbolize the three realms of buddhist cosmology namely kamadhatu the world of desires rupadhatu the world of forms and finally arupadhatu the formless world ordinary sentient beings live out their lives on the lowest level the realm of desire those who have burnt out all desire for continued existence leave the world of desire and live in the world on the level of form alone they see forms but are not drawn to them finally full buddhas go beyond even form and experience reality at its purest most fundamental level the formless ocean of nirv a the liberation from the cycle of sa s ra where the enlightened soul had no longer attached to worldly form corresponds to the concept of s nyat the complete voidness or the nonexistence of the self k madh tu is represented by the base rupadhatu by the five square platforms the body and arupadhatu by the three circular platforms and the large topmost stupa the architectural features between the three stages have metaphorical differences for instance square and detailed decorations in the rupadhatu disappear into plain circular platforms in the arupadhatu to represent how the world of forms where men are still attached with forms and names changes into the world of the formless congregational worship in borobudur is performed in a walking pilgrimage pilgrims are guided by the system of staircases and corridors ascending to the top platform each platform represents one stage of enlightenment the path that guides pilgrims was designed to symbolize buddhist cosmology in a hidden structure under the base was accidentally discovered the hidden footing contains reliefs of which are narratives describing the real k madh tu the remaining reliefs are panels with short inscriptions that apparently provide instructions for the sculptors illustrating the scenes to be carved the real base is hidden by an encasement base the purpose of which remains a mystery it was first thought that the real base had to be covered to prevent a disastrous subsidence of the monument into the hill there is another theory that the encasement base was added because the original hidden footing was incorrectly designed according to vastu shastra the indian ancient book about architecture and town planning regardless of why it was commissioned the encasement base was built with detailed and meticulous design and with aesthetic and religious consideration approximately cubic metres cu yd of andesite stones were taken from neighbouring stone quarries to build the monument the stone was cut to size transported to the site and laid without mortar knobs indentations and dovetails were used to form joints between stones the roof of stupas niches and arched gateways were constructed in corbelling method reliefs were created in situ after the building had been completed the monument is equipped with a good drainage system to cater to the area s high stormwater run off to prevent flooding spouts are installed at each corner each with a unique carved gargoyle in the shape of a giant or makara borobudur differs markedly from the general design of other structures built for this purpose instead of being built on a flat surface borobudur is built on a natural hill however construction technique is similar to other temples in java without the inner spaces seen in other temples and with a general design similar to the shape of pyramid borobudur was first thought more likely to have served as a stupa instead of a temple a stupa is intended as a shrine for the buddha sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of buddhism a temple on the other hand is used as a house of worship the meticulous complexity of the monument s design suggests that borobudur is in fact a temple little is known about gunadharma the architect of the complex his name is recounted from javanese folk tales rather than from written inscriptions the basic unit of measurement used during construction was the tala defined as the length of a human face from the forehead s hairline to the tip of the chin or the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance the unit is thus relative from one individual to the next but the monument has exact measurements a survey conducted in revealed frequent findings of a ratio of around the monument the architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the fractal and self similar geometry in borobudur s design this ratio is also found in the designs of pawon and mendut nearby buddhist temples archeologists have conjectured that the ratio and the tala have calendrical astronomical and cosmological significance as is the case with the temple of angkor wat in cambodia the main structure can be divided into three components base body and top the base is m m ft ft in size with metres ft walls the body is composed of five square platforms each of diminishing height the first terrace is set back metres ft from the edge of the base each subsequent terrace is set back metres ft leaving a narrow corridor at each stage the top consists of three circular platforms with each stage supporting a row of perforated stupas arranged in concentric circles there is one main dome at the center the top of which is the highest point of the monument metres ft above ground level stairways at the center of each of the four sides give access to the top with a number of arched gates overlooked by lion statues the gates are adorned with kala s head carved on top of each and makaras projecting from each side this kala makara motif is commonly found on the gates of javanese temples the main entrance is on the eastern side the location of the first narrative reliefs stairways on the slopes of the hill also link the monument to the low lying plain borobudur is constructed in such a way that it reveals various levels of terraces showing intricate architecture that goes from being heavily ornamented with bas reliefs to being plain in arupadhatu circular terraces the first four terrace walls are showcases for bas relief sculptures these are exquisite considered to be the most elegant and graceful in the ancient buddhist world the bas reliefs in borobudur depicted many scenes of daily life in th century ancient java from the courtly palace life hermit in the forest to those of commoners in the village it also depicted temple marketplace various flora and fauna and also native vernacular architecture people depicted here are the images of king queen princes noblemen courtier soldier servant commoners priest and hermit the reliefs also depicted spiritual beings in buddhism such as asuras gods bodhisattvas kinnaras gandharvas and apsaras the images depicted on bas relief often served as reference for historians to research for certain subjects such as the study of architecture weaponry economy fashion and also mode of transportation of th century maritime southeast asia one of the famous renderings of an th century southeast asian double outrigger ship is borobudur ship today the actual size replica of borobudur ship that had sailed from indonesia to africa in is displayed in the samudra raksa museum located a few hundred meters north of borobudur the borobudur reliefs also pay close attention to indian aesthetic discipline such as pose and gesture that contain certain meanings and aesthetic value the reliefs of noblemen noble women kings or divine beings such as apsaras taras and boddhisattvas are usually portrayed in tribhanga pose the three bend pose on neck hips and knee with one leg resting and one upholding the body weight this position is considered as the most graceful pose such as the figure of surasundari holding a lotus during borobudur excavation archeologists discovered colour pigments of blue red green black as well as bits of gold foil and concluded that the monument that we see today a dark gray mass of volcanic stone lacking in colour was probably once coated with varjalepa white plaster and then painted with bright colors serving perhaps as a beacon of buddhist teaching the same vajralepa plaster can also be found in sari kalasan and sewu temples it is likely that the bas reliefs of borobudur was originally quite colourful before centuries of torrential tropical rainfalls peeled off the colour pigments borobudur contains approximately individual bas reliefs narrative and decorative panels which cover the fa ades and balustrades the total relief surface is square metres sq ft and they are distributed at the hidden foot k madh tu and the five square platforms rupadhatu the narrative panels which tell the story of sudhana and manohara are grouped into series that encircle the monument with a total length of metres ft the hidden foot contains the first series with narrative panels and the remaining series are distributed throughout walls and balustrades in four galleries starting from the eastern entrance stairway to the left narrative panels on the wall read from right to left while those on the balustrade read from left to right this conforms with pradaksina the ritual of circumambulation performed by pilgrims who move in a clockwise direction while keeping the sanctuary to their right the hidden foot depicts the workings of karmic law the walls of the first gallery have two superimposed series of reliefs each consists of panels the upper part depicts the biography of lord buddha while the lower part of the wall and also the balustrades in the first and the second galleries tell the story of the buddha s former lives the remaining panels are devoted to sudhana s further wandering about his search terminated by his attainment of the perfect wisdom the hidden panels do not form a continuous story but each panel provides one complete illustration of cause and effect there are depictions of blameworthy activities from gossip to murder with their corresponding punishments there are also praiseworthy activities that include charity and pilgrimage to sanctuaries and their subsequent rewards the pains of hell and the pleasure of heaven are also illustrated there are scenes of daily life complete with the full panorama of sa s ra the endless cycle of birth and death the encasement base of the borobudur temple was disassembled to reveal the hidden foot and the reliefs were photographed by casijan chepas in it is these photographs that are displayed in borobudur museum karmawibhangga museum located just several hundred meters north of the temple during the restoration the foot encasement was reinstalled covering the karmawibhangga reliefs today only the southeast corner of the hidden foot is revealed and visible for visitors the story starts with the descent of the buddha from the tushita heaven and ends with his first sermon in the deer park at sarnath the relief shows the birth of the buddha as prince siddhartha son of king suddhodana and queen maya of kapilavastu in nepal the birth is preceded by panels showing various preparations in the heavens and on the earth to welcome the final incarnation of the bodhisattva before descending from tushita heaven the bodhisattva entrusted his crown to his successor the future buddha maitreya he descended on earth in the shape of a white elephant with six tusks and penetrated to queen maya s right womb queen maya had a dream of this event which was interpreted that his son would become either a sovereign or a buddha while queen maya felt that it was the time to give birth she went to the lumbini park near kapilavastu she stood under a sal tree shorea robusta holding one branch with her right hand and she gave birth to a son prince siddhartha from her side the story on the panels continues until the sermon in the deer park at sarnath his first sermon after his enlightenment jatakas are stories about the buddha before he was born as prince siddhartha they are the stories that tell about the previous lives of the buddha in both human and animal form the future buddha may appear in them as a king an outcast a god an elephant but in whatever form he exhibits some virtue that the tale thereby inculcates avadanas are similar to jatakas but the main figure is not the bodhisattva himself the saintly deeds in avadanas are attributed to other legendary persons jatakas and avadanas are treated in one and the same series in the reliefs of borobudur the first twenty lower panels in the first gallery on the wall depict the sudhanakumaravadana or the saintly deeds of sudhana the first upper panels in the same gallery on the balustrades are devoted to the legends of the jatakamala the remaining panels depict stories from other sources as do the lower series and panels in the second

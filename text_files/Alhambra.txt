 the alhambra l h mbr spanish a lamb a arabic romanized al amr pronounced al am ra lit the red one is a palace and fortress complex located in granada andalusia spain it is one of the most famous monuments of islamic architecture and one of the best preserved palaces of the historic islamic world in addition to containing notable examples of spanish renaissance architecture the complex was begun in by muhammad i ibn al ahmar the first nasrid emir and founder of the emirate of granada the last muslim state of al andalus it was built on the sabika hill an outcrop of the sierra nevada which had been the site of earlier fortresses and of the th century palace of samuel ibn naghrillah later nasrid rulers continuously modified the site the most significant construction campaigns which gave the royal palaces much of their definitive character took place in the th century during the reigns of yusuf i and muhammad v after the conclusion of the christian reconquista in the site became the royal court of ferdinand and isabella where christopher columbus received royal endorsement for his expedition and the palaces were partially altered in charles v commissioned a new renaissance style palace in direct juxtaposition with the nasrid palaces but it was left uncompleted in the early th century after being allowed to fall into disrepair for centuries with its buildings occupied by squatters the alhambra was rediscovered following the defeat of napoleon i whose troops destroyed parts of the site the rediscoverers were first british intellectuals and then other american and northern european romantic travelers the most influential of them was washington irving whose tales of the alhambra brought international attention to the site the alhambra was one of the first islamic monuments to become the object of modern scientific study and has been the subject of numerous restorations since the th century it is now one of spain s major tourist attractions and a unesco world heritage site during the nasrid era the alhambra was a self contained city separate from the rest of granada below it contained most of the amenities of a muslim city such as a friday mosque hammams public baths roads houses artisan workshops a tannery and a sophisticated water supply system as a royal city and citadel it contained at least six major palaces most of them located along the northern edge where they commanded views over the albaic n quarter the most famous and best preserved are the mexuar the comares palace the palace of the lions and the partal palace which form the main attraction to visitors today the other palaces are known from historical sources and from modern excavations at the alhambra s western tip is the alcazaba fortress multiple smaller towers and fortified gates are also located along the alhambra s walls outside the alhambra walls and located nearby to the east is the generalife a former nasrid country estate and summer palace accompanied by historic orchards and modern landscaped gardens the architecture of the nasrid palaces reflects the tradition of moorish architecture developed over previous centuries it is characterized by the use of the courtyard as a central space and basic unit around which other halls and rooms were organized courtyards typically had water features at their center such as a reflective pool or a fountain decoration was focused on the inside of the building and was executed primarily with tile mosaics on lower walls and carved stucco on the upper walls geometric patterns vegetal motifs and arabic inscriptions were the main types of decorative motifs additionally stalactite like sculpting known as muqarnas was used for three dimensional features like vaulted ceilings alhambra derives from the arabic al amr f meaning the red one the complete form of which was al qal at al amr the red fortress qalat the al in alhambra means the in arabic but this is ignored in general usage in both english and spanish where the name is normally given the definite article the reference to the colour red in the name is due to the reddish colour of its walls which were constructed of rammed earth the reddish colour comes from the iron oxide in the local clay used for this type of construction the evidence for a roman presence is unclear but archeologists have found remains of ancient foundations on the sabika hill a fortress or citadel probably dating from the visigothic period existed on the hill in the th century the first reference to the qal at al amra was during the battles between the arabs and the muladies during the rule of abdallah ibn muhammad r according to surviving documents from the era the red castle was quite small and its walls were not capable of deterring an army intent on conquering the first reference to al amr came in lines of poetry attached to an arrow shot over the ramparts recorded by ibn hayyan d deserted and roofless are the houses of our enemies invaded by the autumnal rains traversed by impetuous winds let them within the red castle kalat al hamra hold their mischievous councils perdition and woe surround them on every side at the beginning of the th century the region of granada was dominated by the zirids a sanhaja berber group and offshoot of the zirids who ruled parts of north africa when the caliphate of c rdoba collapsed after and the fitna civil war began the zirid leader zawi ben ziri established an independent kingdom for himself the taifa of granada the zirids built their citadel and palace known as the al qa aba al qad ma old citadel or old palace on the hill now occupied by the albaic n neighborhood it was connected to two other fortresses on the sabika and mauror hills to the south on the darro river between the zirid citadel and the sabika hill was a sluice gate called b b al dif f gate of the tambourines a which could be closed to retain water if needed this gate was part of the fortification connecting the zirid citadel with the fortress on the sabika hill and it also formed part of a coracha from arabic qawraja a type of fortification allowing soldiers from the fortress to access the river and bring back water even during times of siege the sabika hill fortress also known as al qasaba al jadida the new citadel was later used for the foundations of the current alcazaba of the alhambra under the zirid kings habbus ibn maksan and badis the most powerful figure in the kingdom was the jewish administrator known as samuel ha nagid in hebrew or isma il ibn nagrilla in arabic samuel built his own palace on the sabika hill possibly on the site of the current palaces although nothing remains of it it reportedly included gardens and water features b the period of the taifa kingdoms during which the zirids ruled came to an end with the conquest of al andalus by the almoravids from north africa during the late th century in the mid th century they were followed by the almohads after almohad rule collapsed and local rulers and factions emerged again across the territory of al andalus with the reconquista in full swing the christian kingdoms of castile and aragon under kings ferdinand iii and james i respectively made major conquests across al andalus castile captured cordoba in and seville in meanwhile ibn al ahmar muhammad i established what became the last and longest reigning muslim dynasty in the iberian peninsula the nasrids who ruled the emirate of granada ibn al ahmar was a relatively new political player in the region and likely came from a modest background but he was able to win the support and consent of multiple muslim settlements under threat from the castilian advance upon settling in granada in ibn al ahmar initially resided in the old citadel of the zirids on the albaicin hill but that same year he began construction of the alhambra as a new residence and citadel c according to an arabic manuscript since published as the an nimo de madrid y copenhague this year abdallah ibn al ahmar climbed to the place called the alhambra he examined it marked the foundations of a castle and left someone in charge of directing the work and before that year had passed the construction of the ramparts was completed water was brought in from the river and a channel carrying the water was built during the reign of the nasrid dynasty the alhambra was transformed into a palatine city complete with an irrigation system composed of aqueducts and water channels that provided water for the complex and for other nearby countryside palaces such as the generalife previously the old fortresses on the hill had been dependent on rainwater collected from the cistern near the alcazaba and on what could be brought up from the darro river below the creation of the sultan s canal arabic romanized saqiyat al sultan which brought water from the mountains to the east solidified the identity of the alhambra as a palace city rather than a defensive and ascetic structure this first hydraulic system was expanded afterwards and included two long water channels and several sophisticated elevation devices to bring water onto the plateau later nasrid rulers after ibn al ahmar continuously modified the site along with the fragile materials themselves which needed regular repairs this makes the exact chronology of its development difficult to determine the only elements preserved from the time of ibn al ahmar are some of the fortification walls particularly the alcazaba at the western end of the complex ibn al ahmar did not have time to complete any major new palaces and he may have initially lived in one of the towers of the alcazaba before later moving to a modest house on the site of the current palace of charles v the oldest major palace for which some remains have been preserved is the structure known as the palacio del partal alto in an elevated location near the center of the complex which probably dates from the reign of ibn al ahmar s son muhammad ii r to the south was the palace of the abencerrajes and to the east was another private palace known as the palace of the convent of san francisco d both of which were probably also originally constructed during the time of muhammad ii muhammad iii r erected the partal palace parts of which are still standing today as well as the alhambra s main congregational mosque on the site of the current church of santa maria de la alhambra the partal palace is the earliest known palace to be built along the northern walls of the complex with views onto the city below it is also the oldest nasrid palace still standing today isma il i r undertook a significant remodeling of the alhambra his reign marked the beginning of the classical period of nasrid architecture during which many major monuments in the alhambra were begun and decorative styles were consolidated isma il decided to build a new palace complex just east of the alcazaba to serve as the official palace of the sultan and the state known as the qa r al sultan or d r al mulk the core of this complex was the comares palace while another wing of the palace the mexuar extended to the west the comares baths are the best preserved element from this initial construction as the rest of the palace was further modified by his successors near the main mosque isma il i also created the rawda the dynastic mausoleum of the nasrids of which only partial remains are preserved yusuf i r carried out further work on the comares palace including the construction of the hall of ambassadors and other works around the current mexuar he also built the alhambra s main gate the puerta de la justicia and the torre de la cautiva one of several small towers with richly decorated rooms along the northern walls muhammad v s reign with interruptions marked the political and cultural apogee of the nasrid emirate as well as the apogee of nasrid architecture particularly during his second reign after there was a stylistic shift towards more innovative architectural layouts and an extensive use of complex muqarnas vaulting his most significant contribution to the alhambra was the construction of the palace of the lions to the east of the comares palace in an area previously occupied by gardens he also remodeled the mexuar created the highly decorated comares fa ade in the patio del cuarto dorado and redecorated the court of the myrtles giving these areas much of their final appearance after muhammad v relatively little major construction work occurred in the alhambra one exception is the torre de las infantas which dates from the time of muhammad vii the th century saw the nasrid dynasty in decline and in turmoil with few significant construction projects and a more repetitive less innovative style of architecture the last nasrid sultan muhammad xii of granada surrendered the emirate of granada in january without the alhambra itself being attacked when the forces of the catholic monarchs king ferdinand ii of aragon and queen isabella i of castile took the surrounding territory with a force of overwhelming numbers muhammad xii moved the remains of his ancestors from the complex as was verified by leopoldo torres balb s in when he found seventy empty tombs the remains are now likely to be located in mond jar in the principality of lecr n after the conquest the alhambra became a royal palace and property of the spanish crown isabella and ferdinand initially took up residence here and stayed in granada for several months up until may it was during this stay that two major events happened on march the monarchs signed the alhambra decree which ordered the expulsion of all jews in spain who refused to convert christopher columbus who had also been present to witness the surrender of granada presented his plans for an expedition across the atlantic to the monarchs in the hall of ambassadors and on april they signed the contract which set the terms for the expedition which landed in the americas later that year the new christian rulers began to make additions and alterations to the palace complex the governorship of the alhambra was entrusted to the tendilla family who were given one of the nasrid palaces the palacio del partal alto near the partal palace to use as family residence i igo l pez de mendoza y qui ones d the second count of tendilla was present in ferdinand ii s entourage when muhammad xii surrendered the keys to the alhambra and he became the alhambra s first spanish governor for almost years after the conquest he made repairs and modifications to its fortifications in order to better protect it against gunpowder artillery attacks multiple towers and fortifications such as the torre de siete suelos the torre de las cabezas and the torres bermejas were built or reinforced in this period as seen by the addition of semi round bastions in the count was also awarded the property of mond jar and subsequently passed on the title of marquis of mond jar to his descendants charles v r visited the alhambra in with his wife isabella of portugal and decided to convert it into a royal residence for his use he rebuilt or modified portions of the nasrid palaces to serve as royal apartments a process which began in and was completed in he also demolished a part of the comares palace to make way for a monumental new palace known the palace of charles v designed in the renaissance style of the period construction of the palace began in but it was eventually left unfinished after the governorship of the tendilla mond jar family came to an end in when philip v confiscated the family s properties in the alhambra and dismissed the marquis of mond jar jos de mendoza ib ez de segovia from his position as mayor alcaide of the alhambra in retaliation for the marquis opposing him in the war of the spanish succession the departure of the tendilla mond jar family marked the beginning of the alhambra s most severe period of decline during this period the spanish state dedicated few resources to it and its management was taken over by self interested local governors who lived with their families inside the neglected palaces over subsequent years the alhambra was further damaged between and granada was occupied by napoleon s army during the peninsular war the french troops under the command of count sebastiani occupied the alhambra as a fortified position and caused significant damage to the monument upon evacuating the city they attempted to dynamite the whole complex to prevent it from being re used as a fortified position they successfully blew up eight towers before the remaining fuses were disabled by spanish soldier jos garcia whose actions saved what remains today in an earthquake caused further damage restoration work was undertaken in by the architect jos contreras endowed in by ferdinand vii after the death of contreras in it was continued by his son rafael died and his grandson mariano contreras died in washington irving lived in granada and wrote his tales of the alhambra first published in which spurred international interest in southern spain and in its islamic era monuments like the alhambra an apartment of which he decorated in new england style other artists and intellectuals such as john frederick lewis and owen jones helped make the alhambra into an icon of the era with their writings and illustrations during the th century the contreras family members continued to be the most important architects and conservators of the alhambra up until during this period they generally followed a theory of stylistic restoration which favoured the construction and addition of elements to make a monument complete but not necessarily corresponding to any historical reality they added elements which they deemed to be representative of what they thought was an arabic style emphasizing the alhambra s purported oriental character for example in rafael contreras and juan pugnaire added persian looking spherical domes to the court of the lions and to the northern portico of the court of the myrtles even though these had nothing to do with nasrid architecture in a revolution deposed isabella ii and the government seized the properties of the spanish monarchy including the alhambra in the alhambra was declared a national monument of spain and the state allocated a budget for its conservation overseen by the provincial commission of monuments mariano contreras the last of the contreras architects to serve as director of conservation of the alhambra was appointed as architectural curator in april his tenure was controversial and his conservation strategy attracted criticism from other authorities in september a fire destroyed a large part of the sala de la barca in the comares palace which highlighted the site s vulnerability a report was commissioned in which resulted in the creation of a special commission in whose task was to oversee conservation and restoration of the alhambra but the commission ultimately failed to exercise control due to friction with contreras in mariano contreras was replaced with modesto cendoya whose work was also criticized cendoya began many excavations in search of new artifacts but often left these works unfinished he restored some important elements of the site like the water supply system but neglected others due to continued friction with cendoya the special commission was dissolved in and replaced with the council patronato of the alhambra in which was charged again with overseeing the site s conservation and cendoya s work in it was linked directly to the directorate general of fine arts of the ministry of public education later the ministry of national education like mariano contreras before him cendoya continued to clash with the supervisory body and to obstruct their control he was eventually dismissed from his post in after cendoya leopoldo torres balb s was appointed as chief architect from to the appointment of torres balb s a trained archeologist and art historian marked a definitive shift to a more scientific and systematic approach to the alhambra s conservation he endorsed the principles of the athens charter for the restoration of monuments which emphasized regular maintenance respect for the work of the past legal protection for heritage monuments and the legitimacy of modern techniques and materials in restoration so long as these were visually recognizable many of the buildings in the alhambra were affected by his work some of the inaccurate changes and additions made by the contreras architects were reversed the young architect opened arcades that had been walled up re excavated filled in pools replaced missing tiles completed inscriptions that lacked portions of their stuccoed lettering and installed a ceiling in the still unfinished palace of charles v he also carried out systematic archeological excavations in various parts of the alhambra unearthing lost nasrid structures such as the palacio del partal alto and the palace of the abencerrajes which provided deeper insight into the former palace city as a whole the work of torres balb s was continued by his assistant francisco prieto moreno who was the chief architectural curator from to in a new council of the alhambra was created to oversee the site which has remained in charge ever since e in the central government in madrid transferred responsibility for the site to the regional government of andalusia and in new statutes and documents were developed to regulate the planning and protection of the site in the alhambra and generalife were also listed as a unesco world heritage site the alhambra is now one of the most popular tourist destinations in spain research archeological investigations and restoration works have also remained ongoing into the st century the alhambra site is about m ft in length and about m ft at its greatest width it extends from west northwest to east southeast and covers an area of about m sq ft or acres it stands on a narrow promontory overlooking the vega or plain of granada and carved by the river darro on its north side as it descends from the sierra nevada the red earth from which the fortress is constructed is a granular aggregate held together by a medium of red clay which gives the resulting layered brick and stone reinforced construction tapial calicastrado its characteristic hue and is at the root of the name of the red hill the alhambra s most westerly feature is the alcazaba a large fortress overlooking the city due to touristic demand modern access runs contrary to the original sequence which began from a principal access via the puerta de la justicia gate of justice onto a large souq or public market square facing the alcazaba now subdivided and obscured by later christian era development from the puerta del vino wine gate ran the calle real royal street dividing the alhambra along its axial spine into a southern residential quarter with mosques hamams bathhouses and diverse functional establishments and a greater northern portion occupied by several palaces of the nobility with extensive landscaped gardens commanding views over the albaic n all of this was subservient to the great tower of the ambassadors in the palacio comares comares palace which acted as the royal audience chamber and throne room with its three arched windows dominating the city the private internalised universe of the palacio de los leones palace of the lions adjoins the public spaces at right angles see plan illustration but was originally connected only by the function of the comares baths or royal baths the mirador de lindaraja serving as the exquisitely decorated focus of meditation and authority overlooking the refined garden courtyard of lindaraja daraxa toward the city the rest of the plateau comprises a number of earlier and later moorish palaces enclosed by a fortified wall with thirteen defensive towers some such as the torre de la infanta and torre de la cautiva containing elaborate vertical palaces in miniature the river darro passes through a ravine on the north and divides the plateau from the albaic n district of granada similarly the sabika valley containing the alhambra park lies on the west and south and beyond this valley the almost parallel ridge of monte mauror separates it from the antequeruela district another ravine separates it from the generalife the summer pleasure gardens of the emir salmer n escobar notes that the later planting of deciduous elms obscures the overall perception of the layout so a better reading of the original landscape is given in winter when the trees are bare the design and decoration of the nasrid palaces are a continuation of moorish western islamic architecture from earlier centuries but developed their own characteristics the combination of carefully proportioned courtyards water features gardens arches on slender columns and intricately sculpted stucco and tile decoration gives nasrid architecture qualities that are described as ethereal and intimate walls were built mostly in rammed earth lime concrete or brick and then covered with plaster while wood mostly pine was used for roofs ceilings doors and window shutters buildings were designed to be seen from within with their decoration focused on the inside the basic unit of nasrid palace architecture was a rectangular courtyard with a pool fountain or water channel at its center courtyards were flanked on two or four sides by halls often preceded by arcaded porticoes many of these structures featured a mirador a room projecting from the exterior commanding scenic views of gardens or of the city buildings were designed with a mathematical proportional system that gives them a harmonious visual quality the layout of the courtyards the distribution of windows and the use of water features were designed with the climate in mind cooling and ventilating the environment in summer while minimizing cold drafts and maximizing sunlight in winter upper floor rooms were smaller and more enclosed making them more suited for use during the winter courtyards were usually aligned in a north south direction which allows the main halls to receive direct sunlight at midday during the winter while during the summer the higher midday sun is blocked by the position and depth of the porticos fronting these halls little is known about the architects and craftsmen who built the alhambra but more is known about the d w n al ins h or chancery this institution seems to have played an increasingly important role in the design of buildings probably because inscriptions came to feature so prominently in their decoration the head of the chancery was often also the vizier prime minister of the sultan although not exactly architects the terms of office of many individuals in these positions coincide with the major phases of construction in the alhambra which suggests that they played a role in leading construction projects the most important figures who held these positions such as ibn al jayyab ibn al khatib and ibn zamrak also composed much of the poetry that adorns the walls of the alhambra ibn al jayyab served as head of the chancery at various times between and under six sultans from muhammad ii to yusuf i ibn al khatib served as both head of the chancery and as vizier for various periods between and under the sultans yusuf i and muhammad v ibn zamrak served as vizier and head of the chancery for periods between and under muhammad v and muhammad vii carved stucco or yeser a in spanish and mosaic tilework zil j or zellij in arabic f alicatado in spanish was used for wall decoration while ceilings were generally made in wood which could be carved and painted in turn tile mosaics and wooden ceilings often feature geometric motifs tilework was generally used for lower walls or for floors while stucco was used for upper zones stucco was typically carved with vegetal arabesque motifs ataurique in spanish from arabic romanized al tawr q lit foliage epigraphic motifs geometric motifs or sebka motifs it could be further sculpted into three dimensional muqarnas moc rabes in spanish arabic inscriptions a feature especially characteristic of the alhambra were carved along the walls and included qur anic excerpts poetry by nasrid court poets and the repetition of the nasrid motto wa la ghalib illa llah arabic lit and there is no conqueror but god white marble quarried from macael in almeria province was also used to make fountains and slender columns the capitals of columns typically consisted of a lower cylindrical section sculpted with stylized acanthus leaves an upper cubic section with vegetal or geometric motifs and inscriptions like the nasrid motto running along the base or the top edge while the stucco decoration wooden ceilings and marble capitals of the alhambra often appear colourless or monochrome today they were originally painted in bright colours primary colours red blue and in place of yellow gold were the most prominent and were juxtaposed to achieve a certain aesthetic balance while other colours were used in more nuanced ways in the background the alhambra features various styles of the arabic epigraphy that developed under the nasrid dynasty and particularly under yusuf i and muhammad v jos miguel puerta v lchez compares the walls of the alhambra to the pages of a manuscript drawing similarities between the zil j covered dados and the geometric manuscript illuminations and the epigraphical forms in the palace to calligraphic motifs in contemporary arabic manuscripts inscriptions typically ran in vertical or horizontal bands or they were set inside cartouches of round or rectangular shape most major inscriptions in the alhambra use the naskhi or cursive script which was the most common script used in writing after the early islamic period thuluth was a derivation of the cursive script often used for more pompous or formal contexts favoured for example in the preambles of documents prepared by the nasrid chancery many inscriptions in the alhambra were composed in a mixed naskhi thuluth script bands of cursive script often alternated with friezes or cartouches of kufic script kufic is the oldest form of arabic calligraphy but by the th century kufic scripts in the western islamic world became increasingly stylized in architectural contexts and could be nearly illegible in the alhambra there are many examples of knotted kufic a particularly elaborate style where the letters tie together in intricate knots the extensions of these letters could turn into strips that continued and formed more abstract motifs or sometimes formed the edges of a cartouche encompassing the rest of the inscription the texts of the alhambra include devout regal votive and qur anic phrases and sentences formed into arabesques carved into wood and marble and glazed onto tiles poets of the nasrid court including ibn al khat b and ibn zamrak composed poems for the palace the inscriptions of the alhambra are also unique for their frequent self referential nature and use of personification some inscribed poems such as those in the palace of the lions talk about the palace or room in which they re situated and are written in the first person as if the room itself was speaking to the reader most of the poetry is inscribed in nasrid cursive script while foliate and floral kufic inscriptions often formed into arches columns enjambments and architectural calligrams are generally used as decorative elements kufic calligrams particularly of the words blessing baraka and felicity yumn are used as decorative motifs in arabesque throughout the palace like the rest of the original stucco decoration many inscriptions were originally painted and enhanced with colours studies indicate that the letters were often painted in gold or silver or in white with black outlines which would have made them stand out on the decorated backgrounds that were often painted in red blue or turquoise with other colours mixed into the details the main gate of the alhambra is the puerta de la justicia gate of justice known in arabic as bab al shari a arabic lit gate of shari a law a massive gate that served as the main entrance on the south side of the walled complex built in during the reign of yusuf i the gate consists of a large horseshoe arch leading to a steep ramp passing through a bent passage the passage turns degrees to the left and then degrees to the right with an opening above where defenders could throw projectiles onto any attackers below the image of a hand whose five fingers symbolized the five pillars of islam is carved above this gate on the exterior while the image of a key another symbol of faith is carved on the corresponding place on the inner side a christian era sculpture of the virgin and christ child was inserted later into another niche just inside the gate near the outside of the gate is the pilar de carlos v a renaissance style fountain built in with some further alterations in at the end of the passage coming from the puerta de la justicia is the plaza de los aljibes place of the cisterns a broad open space which divides the alcazaba from the nasrid palaces the plaza is named after a large cistern dating to around commissioned by i igo l pez de mondoza y qui ones the cistern was one of the first works carried out in the alhambra after the conquest and it filled what was previously a gully between the alcazaba and the palaces on the east side of the square is the puerta del vino wine gate which leads to palace of charles v and to the former residential neighbourhoods the medina of the alhambra the gate s construction is attributed to the reign of muhammad iii although the decoration dates from different periods both sides of the gate are embellished with ceramic decoration in the spandrels of the arches and stucco decoration above on the western side of the gate is the carving of a key symbol like the one on the puerta de la justicia the other main gate of the alhambra was the puerta de las armas gate of arms located on the north side of the alcazaba from which a walled ramp leads towards the plaza de los aljibes and the nasrid palaces this was originally the main access point to the complex for the regular residents of the city since it was accessible from the albaic n side but after the christian conquest the puerta de la justicia was favoured by ferdinand and isabella the gate one of the earliest structures built in the alhambra in the th century is one of the alhambra structures that bears the most resemblance to the almohad architectural tradition that preceded the nasrids the exterior fa ade of the gate is decorated with a polylobed moulding with glazed tiles inside a rectangular alfiz frame inside the gate s passage is a dome that is painted to simulate the appearance of red brick a decorative feature characteristic of the nasrid period two other exterior gates existed both located further east on the north side is the puerta del arrabal arrabal gate which opens onto the cuesta de los chinos slope of the pebbles the ravine between the alhambra and the generalife it was probably created under muhammad ii and served the first palaces of the alhambra which were built in this area during his reign it underwent numerous modifications in the later christian era of the alhambra on the south side is the puerta de los siete suelos gate of seven floors which was almost entirely destroyed by the explosions set off by the departing french troops in the present gate was reconstructed in the s with help of remaining fragments and of multiple old engravings that illustrate the former gate the original gate was probably built in the mid th century and its original arabic name was bab al gudur it would have been the main entrance serving the medina the area occupied by industries and regular houses inside the alhambra it was also through here that the catholic monarchs first entered the alhambra on january the alcazaba or citadel is the oldest part of the alhambra today it was the centerpiece of the complicated system of fortifications that protected the area its tallest tower the m ft high torre del homenaje tower of homage was the keep and military command post of the complex it may have also been the first residence of ibn al ahmar inside the alhambra while the complex was being constructed the westernmost tower the m ft high torre de la vela acted as a watch tower the flag of ferdinand and isabella was first raised above it as a symbol of the spanish conquest of granada on january a bell was added on the tower soon afterward and for centuries it was rung at regular times every day and on special occasions in the tower became part of the city s coat of arms inside the enclosure of the inner fortress was a residential district that housed the elite guards of the alhambra it contained urban amenities like a communal kitchen a hammam and a water supply cistern as well as multiple subterranean chambers which served as dungeons and silos the royal palace complex consists of three main parts from west to east the mexuar the comares palace and the palace of the lions g collectively these palaces are also known as the casa real vieja old royal palace to distinguish them from the newer palaces erected next to them during the christian spanish period the mexuar is the westernmost part of the palace complex it was analogous to the mashwars or mechouars of royal palaces in north africa it was first built as part of the larger complex begun by isma il i which included the comares palace it housed many of the administrative and more public functions of the palace such as the chancery and the treasury its layout consisted of two consecutive courtyards followed by a main hall all aligned along a central axis from west to east little remains of the two western courtyards of the mexuar today except for their foundations a portico and the water basin of a fountain the main hall known as the sala del mexuar or council hall served as a throne hall where the sultan received and judged petitions this area also granted access to the comares palace via the cuarto dorado section on the east side of the council hall multiple parts of the mexuar were significantly modified in the post reconquista period notably the sala del mexuar was converted into a christian chapel and additions were made to the cuarto dorado to convert it into a residence many of these additions were later removed during modern restorations in the th and th centuries the comares palace was the core of a large palace complex begun by isma il i in the early th century and subsequently modified and refurbished by yusuf i and muhammad v over the course of the same century this new palace complex served as the official palace of the sultan and the state known in arabic as the qa r al sultan or d r al mulk the comares palace was accessed from the west through the mexuar an internal fa ade known as the comares fa ade stands on the south side of the patio de cuarto dorado courtyard of the gilded room at the east edge of the mexuar this highly decorated symmetrical fa ade with two doors was the entrance to the palace and likely served in some ceremonial functions the comares palace itself is centered around the patio de los arrayanes court of the myrtles a courtyard measuring to metres wide and metres long with its long axis aligned roughly north to south at the middle aligned with the main axis of the court is a wide reflective pool the pool measures metres long and meters wide the myrtle bushes that are the court s namesake grow in hedges along either side of this pool two ornate porticos are situated at the north and south ends of the court leading to further halls and rooms behind them the court s decoration contained qas id by ibn zamrak of which remain annexed to the east side of the palace are the comares baths a royal hammam that is exceptionally well preserved on the north side of the court of the myrtles inside the massive comares tower is the sal n de los embajadores hall of the ambassadors the largest room in the alhambra it is accessed by passing through the sala de la barca h a wide rectangular hall behind the northern portico of the court the hall of the ambassadors is a square chamber measuring meters per side and rising to a height of metres this was the throne room or audience chamber of the sultan the sultan s throne was placed opposite the entrance in front of a recessed double arched window at the back of the hall in addition to the extensive tile and stucco decoration of the walls the interior culminates in a large domed ceiling the ceiling is made of interlinked pieces of wood that form an abstract geometric representation of the seven heavens the hall and its tower project from the walls of the palace with windows providing views in three directions in this sense it was an enlarged version of a mirador a room from which the palace s inhabitants could gaze outward to the surrounding landscape the palace of the lions is one of the most famous palaces in islamic architecture and exemplifies the apogee of nasrid architecture under the reign of muhammad v its central rectangular courtyard measures about meters long and meters wide with its long axis aligned roughly east to west the arches and columns of the surrounding portico are arranged in a complex pattern of single columns alternating with groups of two or three columns a design that was unique in islamic architecture two ornate pavilions stand at the east and west sides of the courtyard while the center is occupied by the famed fountain of the lions the fountain consists of a large basin surrounded by twelve stylized lion sculptures all carved from marble along the rim of the fountain s basin is an inscribed poem composed by ibn zamrak this praises the beauty of the fountain and the power of the lions but it also describes their hydraulic systems and how they worked four halls are arranged around the courtyard the sala de los moc rabes hall of the moc rabes muqarnas on the west side was damaged in by the explosion of a nearby gunpowder magazine and its ceiling was replaced by the current baroque style plaster vault in the sala de los reyes hall of kings on the east side is subdivided into multiple sections covered by muqarnas vaults opening behind these are several more rooms three of which contain rounded vault ceilings covered by unique pictorial scenes painted on leather one painting shows a nasrid sultan and other dignitaries sitting and discussing together while the two other paintings feature scenes of sports hunting and court life the style of painting was influenced to one extent or another by christian gothic art on the south side of the courtyard the sala de los abencerrajes hall of the abencerrages derives its name from a legend according to which the father of boabdil the last sultan of granada having invited the chiefs of that line to a banquet massacred them here it is covered by an elaborate muqarnas vault ceiling featuring a sided lantern cupola in the shape of an eight pointed star possibly symbolizing the celestial heaven on the north side of the courtyard is the sala de dos hermanas hall of two sisters so called because of two large slabs of marble that form part of the pavement its original arabic name was al qubba al kubr arabic lit the great dome suggesting it had a particular significance the hall is covered by one of the most remarkable muqarnas domes in islamic art the muqarnas composition consists of at least prismatic pieces unfolding from the central summit into sixteen miniature domes right above the level of the windows to the north of the sala de dos hermanas and accessed through it is the mirador de lindaraja a small projecting room with double arched windows on three sides which overlook the gardens below the name lindaraja is a corruption of arabic ayn dar aisha arabic lit eye of the house of aisha this small chamber has some of the most sophisticated carved stucco decoration in the alhambra and retains original mosaic tilework that features very fine arabic inscriptions the room is also covered by a unique vault ceiling consisting of a wooden lattice shaped into an interlacing geometric motif and filled with pieces of coloured glass to the east of the comares palace and the palace of the lions is an area of renaissance style christian additions dating primarily from the th century directly north of the palace of the lions is the patio de lindaraja lindaraja courtyard originally an open garden area but turned into a cloistered garden by the addition of new structures around it during the th century the fountain at its center features a baroque pedestal made in that supports a nasrid marble basin installed here at the same time although a replica now replaces the original basin which is kept at the alhambra museum on the west and north sides of the courtyard along the upper floors are six rooms constructed for charles v between and known as the emperor s chambers the most interesting details of the rooms are a marble fireplace sculpted with the emperor s coat of arms and a ceiling of panels painted with pictures of fruits the paintings were made around by julio aquiles and alejandro mayner to the west of the lindaraja courtyard is the smaller patio de la reja courtyard of the queen located between the emperor s chambers and the comares tower a gallery was built around the upper floor of the courtyard between and further north is a tower known as the peinador de la reina queen s robing room formerly known as the tower of abu al juyyush this was originally a stand alone fortification tower in the alhambra walls that was probably built in the reign of nasr r also known as abu al juyyush yusuf i converted it into a small palatial residence with a lantern ceiling and muhammad v later added decoration around its entrance between and it was connected to the emperor s chambers via a new elevated gallery and an upper level was added to the tower around the existing lantern ceiling between and this upper floor was painted by julio aquiles and alejandro mayner with mythological scenes depictions of charles v s invasion of tunis and more formal classical like motifs later in nasrid period columns and capitals from other palaces were integrated into the gallery some of which were later moved to the alhambra museum to the east of the palace of the lions and the renaissance additions is the partal palace a pavilion structure on the edge of the alhambra walls it was built by muhammad iii which makes it the oldest surviving palace in the alhambra today although it has undergone many alterations since then its south side has a portico and faces a large reflective pool while a mirador projects from its north side over the walls next to it is a small but richly decorated oratory containing a mihrab beyond the partal is an area of gardens stretching along the northern wall of the alhambra several towers along this northern wall were converted into small palatial residences during the nasrid period including the torre de los picos tower of the pointed battlements the torre de la cautiva tower of the captive and the torre de las infantas tower of the princesses for tourists visiting the alhambra today all these areas are accessible after passing through the main nasrid palaces although the palace towers are not normally open to visitors the palace commissioned by charles v in the middle of the alhambra was designed by pedro machuca an architect who had trained under michelangelo in rome and who was steeped in the culture of the italian high renaissance and of the artistic circles of raphael and giulio romano it was conceived in a contemporary renaissance style or roman style with an innovative design reflecting the architectural ideals of this period the construction of a monumental italian influenced palace in the heart of the nasrid built alhambra symbolized charles v s imperial status and the triumph of christianity over islam achieved by his grandparents the catholic monarchs it consists of a massive square structure of stone which encloses a perfectly circular courtyard the exterior facades are divided into two horizontal zones of decoration with rustication below and pilasters alternating with other embellishments above the two main entrance portals on the western and southern sides have designs resembling triumphal arches with engaged columns the pedestals of these columns are carved with reliefs depicting allegorical scenes such as the victories destroying armaments representing the emperor s imposition of a universal peace the upper fa ade of the southern entrance portal features a serlian window among the other details of the palace fa ades are a series of bronze rings or knockers which are strictly ornamental with more hispanic symbolic imagery such as lion and eagle heads pedro machuca had intended to create plazas with colonnades on the east and west sides of the building to serve as a grand new approach to the alhambra palaces but these were never executed construction of the palace began in after machuca s death in it was continued by his son luis who finished the facades and built the internal courtyard work was halted for years when the morisco rebellion began work was still unfinished when philip iv visited in and the project was finally abandoned in leaving the structure without a roof it was finally completed after when leopoldo torres balb s began its restoration today the building houses the alhambra museum which holds objects and artefacts relating to the alhambra s history as well as the fine arts museum of granada which houses a collection of paintings from granada dating from the th to th centuries three other major nasrid era palaces once existed but were largely destroyed over the centuries the excavated remains of the palacio del partal alto upper partal palace also known as the palacio del conde del tendilla palace of the count of tendilla are incorporated today into the partal gardens the palace dates from the time of muhammad ii with later renovations and modifications and is the oldest palace in the alhambra of which traces have been found the palace of the convent of san francisco palacio del convento de san francisco also known as the palacio de los infantes is named after the convent of saint francis which was installed here in the nasrid palace here was probably first built by muhammad ii but some surviving inscriptions suggest it was significantly remodeled by muhammad v little remains of the nasrid structure today except for a rectangular courtyard and some of its adjoining rooms including a richly decorated chamber with muqarnas vaulting queen isabella i was originally buried here in before her body was moved to the royal chapel near the cathedral the rest of the present day building dates from an th century remodeling of the convent and includes a cloistered courtyard today it serves as a parador state owned hotel the palace of the abencerrajes palacio de los abencerrajes was one of the largest palaces in the alhambra and may also date from the time of muhammad ii what was left of the palace was blown up by napoleon s troops in it then became part of an area of abandoned ruins known as the secano its excavated remains are visible today in the southern part of the complex but they have yet to be fully studied located just east of the palace of charles v is the catholic church of santa mar a de la alhambra saint mary of the alhambra which stands on the site of the former alhambra mosque the congregational mosque of the alhambra complex the church was built between and it is under the authority of the archbishop of granada the building was designed by architects juan de herrera and juan de orea and completed by ambrosio vico inside is a large baroque altarpiece with gilded ornate columns completed in although the most impressive centerpiece of the altar a sculpture of our lady of sorrows depicting mary holding the body of jesus was carved between and by torcuato ruiz del peral every year during holy week this sculpture is taken out and carried in a procession through the streets of granada during processions it is carried on top of a throne or platform that is sculpted to resemble the arcades in the court of the lions little remains of the alhambra mosque which stood previously on this site aside from an ornate bronze lamp now preserved at the national archaeological museum in madrid according to an inscription on this lamp and to the writings of ibn al khatib the mosque was commissioned by muhammad iii and completed in the mosque s main axis was aligned towards the qibla to the southeast which also matched the alignment of the main street next to it the structure consisted of a hypostyle hall with three naves separated by rows of three arches the arches were supported by marble columns with capitals similar in style to those of the earlier cordoban caliphate period in the th century the roof was made of wood and the central nave which led to the mihrab had a higher ceiling than the two side naves a slender minaret stood at the western end of the building after the christian conquest the building was converted to a church but by the late th century it was in disrepair it was finally demolished in prior to the construction of the present church one of the alhambra mosque s annexes the baths hammam has been preserved on the east side of the church today and is accessible from the main street like other islamic baths it provided general hygiene to the local residents as well as the means to perform the ritual ablutions ghusl for religious purposes although sometimes eroticized in romantic western literature visitors attended the baths strictly with members of the same sex and wore cloths or towels around their private parts these baths were constructed under muhammad iii along with the mosque they may have been partly demolished in before being incorporated into a residential house during the th and th centuries the preserved remains were significant enough to enable their restoration and reconstruction in the layout of the baths had a typical sequence of rooms including a changing room bayt al maslak h in arabic a cold room bayt al barid and a hot room bayt al sak hun behind the hot room there would have been a boiler room where water was heated and firewood stored nearby original fragments of tile and stucco decoration as well as part of the marble flooring have been preserved in some of the rooms the hot room has one small pool and another may have existed where a modern fountain stands today however unlike in christian and earlier greco roman culture muslims generally did not favour swimming or immersion in water for their visits to the baths private baths of varying size and importance were also built as part of the alhambra s palaces in the space between the former mosque and the palace of the lions stood the rawda spelled rauda in spanish the royal mausoleum of the nasrids the term rawda arabic means garden in arabic but a number of historic islamic necropolises or cemeteries were known by this name including the necropolis of the former umayyad rulers in cordoba the nasrid mausoleum was first built by isma il i in the early th century though an earlier cemetery may have already existed there previously the structure no longer stands today but it has been studied by archeologists and its foundations are still visible the necropolis consisted of a rectangular enclosure which was accessed through a small horseshoe arch gate preserved today on its north side inside the enclosure was a square mausoleum chamber covered by a roof with a central square lantern the presence of the lantern is indicated by the remains of four pillars in the center of the structure some rectangular rooms were adjoined to the side of this chamber the mausoleum was preceded by a rectangular courtyard this layout was similar to some earlier mausoleums in north africa and to the later saadian tombs in marrakesh like the nearby mosque the mausoleum was aligned with the qibla it was decorated with carved stucco and tilework remains of which have been uncovered in excavations the windows of the central lantern were closed with wooden latticework an example of which is preserved in the alhambra museum today the most important persons such as the nasrid rulers were buried inside this mausoleum but in the open space between the mausoleum and the outer enclosure wall were other graves belonging to less important figures the tombs of important figures were covered with marble slabs on top of which were pyramidal or prismatic stones known as maqabriyyas while lesser tombs outside where framed by stone curbs that made them look like miniature gardens at the heads of important graves were marble tombstones carved with detailed inscriptions some examples of which are preserved at the alhambra museum today in during construction of the nearby palace of charles v the tombstones of muhammad ii isma il i yusuf i and yusuf iii were discovered when torres balb s investigated the site in he found more graves inside the enclosure almost all the graves were already empty as muhammad xii the last sultan of granada arranged to have the remains of his ancestors moved to an unknown site at mond jar in the alpujarras to the east of the alhambra and outside its walls is the generalife from arabic romanized jannat al rifa i a nasrid era country estate which was first built by muhammad ii and muhammad iii in the late th and early th centuries it underwent multiple modifications under later nasrid rulers and then by christian spanish builders in the th century it features several rectangular garden courtyards with decorated pavilions at either end a large area of landscaped gardens from the th century occupies the approach to the former palace today the nasrid palace was originally linked to the alhambra by a walled corridor that crossed the valley between them the main approach to the alhambra today is through the alhambra woods in the valley on its south side the outer entrance to the woods is through the puerta de las granadas gate of the pomegranates a formal renaissance style gate built in over the remains of an earlier islamic era gate within the woods is the puerta de birambla from arabic bab al ramla one of the former islamic era gates in granada s city walls which was demolished between and and then reconstructed here in to the south of the puerta de las granadas are the torres bermejas vermilion towers a group of three adjacent towers on the mauror hill their origin is not clear but the oldest remains found here date from the late th century or early th century they may have been inhabited by muhammad i the founder of the nasrid dynasty in the th century during the christian spanish era an artillery bastion was added to them on the northwest side during the nasrid period there were several other country estates and palaces to the east of the alhambra and the generalife located on the mountainside and taking advantage of the water supply system which ran through this area the two best known examples are the palacio de los alijares and the dar al arusa arabic lit house of the bride both of which were built in the th century and then abandoned some time after the conquest only traces of them remain today they were probably richly decorated like the alhambra palaces and were accompanied by gardens and amenities like hammams also nearby is the silla del moro seat of the moor a ruined structure on the hilltop overlooking the generalife it was once a fort and monitoring post that protected the water supply infrastructure in this area water was provided to both the alhambra and the generalife by the acequia del sultan also known as the acequia del rey or acequia real j which still exists in large part today it draws water from the darro river at an uphill location in the foothills of the sierra nevada about kilometers east of the alhambra a smaller branch known as the acequia del tercio also splits off from it several kilometers upstream and proceeded along higher ground before arriving at the top point of the generalife s palace and gardens the main branch proceeding along lower ground also arrives at the generalife palace and supplies water to its iconic patio de la acequia both canals generally ran along the surface but some parts ran through tunnels cut directly into the bedrock after arriving at the generalife the canals turn towards the southeast and run past the gardens they then join together before turning back towards the alhambra where the water enters via an arched aqueduct next to the torre del agua water tower at the alhambra s eastern tip from here it is channeled through the citadel via a complex system of conduits acequias and water tanks albercones which create the celebrated interplay of light sound and surface in the palaces while the walls and rooms of the alhambra are devoid of furnishings today they would have originally been decorated and filled with many objects such as carpets floor cushions and tapestries or similar objects to be hung on the walls the custom of sitting on the ground explains why some of the windows in the miradors lookout rooms were situated so low where the eyeline of seated persons would be among the most famous objects from the nasrid palaces are the alhambra vases a type of large hispano moresque ware from the nasrid period that were mostly found in the alhambra they stood on display in parts of the palace probably in the corners of rooms their practical function if any is unclear but they probably served as accessories to compliment the architecture they stood about centimeters tall on average making them the largest lusterware pieces ever made they were shaped like amphorae with narrow bases bulging body and narrow ribbed necks flanked by flat handles shaped like wings they were decorated with arabic inscriptions and other motifs with the most common colours being cobalt blue white and gold ten vases of this kind have survived and began to be documented in the th century making their way into museums afterwards the earliest examples are dated to the late th or early th century but the most elegant examples date from the late th or early th century it s unclear where exactly they were produced as there were several centers of ceramic production in the nasrid kingdom including granada and m laga one of the best examples is the th century vase of the gazelles now kept at the alhambra museum it stands centimeters tall and is named after the image of confronted gazelles painted on its body smaller jars and vases were also kept in niches in the walls and entrances of many rooms of the alhambra a taqa a niche set into the walls under an archway in the jambs was a characteristic element of nasrid architecture where such jars were kept possibly filled with water for visitors examples of these niches are found in the entrance to the hall of ambassadors another significant surviving object from the alhambra is an elaborate bronze lamp that once hung in the main mosque dated to the main section of the lamp is conical in shape tied to a shaft or stem above which is punctuated with small spherical sections the bronze is pierced to create arabic inscriptions in a naskhi script and a background of vegetal arabesque motifs after the conquest it was confiscated and made part of the treasury of cardinal cisneros it is now on display at the national archaeological museum in madrid although a replica is also kept at the alhambra museum parts of the following works are set in the alhambra the plot of the ballet h ro que entitled za de reine de grenade by the french baroque composer joseph nicolas pancrace royer c takes place at the alhambra alhambra has directly inspired musical compositions including francisco t rrega s famous tremolo study for guitar recuerdos

often remembered nostalgically in some muslim societies after the christian conquest of and may have influenced later examples of islamic architecture for example several monuments constructed by the saadian dynasty which ruled morocco in the th and th centuries appear to imitate prototypes found in the alhambra particularly the court of the lions the alhambra also inspired a number of buildings in moorish revival architecture

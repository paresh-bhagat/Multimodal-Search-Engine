 the great wall of china traditional chinese simplified chinese pinyin w nl ch ngch ng literally ten thousand li wall is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient chinese states and imperial china as protection against various nomadic groups from the eurasian steppe several walls were built from as early as the th century bc with selective stretches later joined by qin shi huang bc the first emperor of china little of the qin wall remains later on many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls the best known sections of the wall were built by the ming dynasty apart from defense other purposes of the great wall have included border controls allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the silk road regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration furthermore the defensive characteristics of the great wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers troop barracks garrison stations signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire and the fact that the path of the great wall also served as a transportation corridor the frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses collectively they stretch from liaodong in the east to lop lake in the west from the present day sino russian border in the north to tao river taohe in the south along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the mongolian steppe spanning km mi in total today the defensive system of the great wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive architectural feats in history the collection of fortifications known as the great wall of china has historically had a number of different names in both chinese and english in chinese histories the term long wall s t s ch ngch ng appears in sima qian s records of the grand historian where it referred both to the separate great walls built between and north of the warring states and to the more unified construction of the first emperor the chinese character meaning city or fortress is a phono semantic compound of the earth radical and phonetic whose old chinese pronunciation has been reconstructed as de it originally referred to the rampart which surrounded traditional chinese cities and was used by extension for these walls around their respective states today however it is much more often the chinese word for city the longer chinese name ten thousand mile long wall t s w nl ch ngch ng came from sima qian s description of it in the records though he did not name the walls as such the ad book of song quotes the frontier general tan daoji referring to the long wall of miles closer to the modern name but the name rarely features in pre modern times otherwise the traditional chinese mile l was an often irregular distance that was intended to show the length of a standard village and varied with terrain but was usually standardized at distances around a third of an english mile m however this use of ten thousand w n is figurative in a similar manner to the greek and english myriad and simply means innumerable or immeasurable because of the wall s association with the first emperor s supposed tyranny the chinese dynasties after qin usually avoided referring to their own additions to the wall by the name long wall instead various terms were used in medieval records including frontier s s i rampart s yu n barrier s zh ng the outer fortresses w ib o and the border wall s t s bi nqi ng poetic and informal names for the wall included the purple frontier z s i and the earth dragon t s t l ng only during the qing period did long wall become the catch all term to refer to the many border walls regardless of their location or dynastic origin equivalent to the english great wall sections of the wall in south gobi desert and mongolian steppe are sometimes referred to as wall of genghis khan even though genghis khan did not construct any walls or permanent defense lines himself the current english name evolved from accounts of the chinese wall from early modern european travelers by the nineteenth century the great wall of china had become standard in english and french although other european languages such as german continue to refer to it as the chinese wall the chinese were already familiar with the techniques of wall building by the time of the spring and autumn period between the th and th centuries bc during this time and the subsequent warring states period the states of qin wei zhao qi han yan and zhongshan all constructed extensive fortifications to defend their own borders built to withstand the attack of small arms such as swords and spears these walls were made mostly of stone or by stamping earth and gravel between board frames king zheng of qin conquered the last of his opponents and unified china as the first emperor of the qin dynasty qin shi huang in bc intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords he ordered the destruction of the sections of the walls that divided his empire among the former states to position the empire against the xiongnu people from the north however he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire s northern frontier build and move on was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall implying that the chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult so builders always tried to use local resources stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains there are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the qin walls most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries and very few sections remain today the human cost of the construction is unknown but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands workers died building the qin wall later the han the northern dynasties and the sui all repaired rebuilt or expanded sections of the great wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders the tang and song dynasties did not undertake any significant effort in the region dynasties founded by non han ethnic groups also built their border walls the xianbei ruled northern wei the khitan ruled liao jurchen led jin and the tangut established western xia who ruled vast territories over northern china throughout centuries all constructed defensive walls but those were located much to the north of the other great walls as we know it within china s autonomous region of inner mongolia and in modern day mongolia itself the great wall concept was revived again under the ming in the th century and following the ming army s defeat by the oirats in the battle of tumu the ming had failed to gain a clear upper hand over the mongol tribes after successive battles and the long drawn conflict was taking a toll on the empire the ming adopted a new strategy to keep the nomadic tribes out by constructing walls along the northern border of china acknowledging the mongol control established in the ordos desert the wall followed the desert s southern edge instead of incorporating the bend of the yellow river unlike the earlier fortifications the ming construction was stronger and more elaborate due to the use of bricks and stone instead of rammed earth up to watchtowers are estimated to have been constructed on the wall as mongol raids continued periodically over the years the ming devoted considerable resources to repair and reinforce the walls sections near the ming capital of beijing were especially strong qi jiguang between and also repaired and reinforced the wall faced sections of the ram earth wall with bricks and constructed watchtowers from shanhaiguan pass to changping to warn of approaching mongol raiders during the s s the ming also built a so called liaodong wall similar in function to the great wall whose extension in a sense it was but more basic in construction the liaodong wall enclosed the agricultural heartland of the liaodong province protecting it against potential incursions by jurchen mongol oriyanghan from the northwest and the jianzhou jurchens from the north while stones and tiles were used in some parts of the liaodong wall most of it was in fact simply an earth dike with moats on both sides towards the end of the ming the great wall helped defend the empire against the manchu invasions that began around even after the loss of all of liaodong the ming army held the heavily fortified shanhai pass preventing the manchus from conquering the chinese heartland the manchus were finally able to cross the great wall in after beijing had already fallen to li zicheng s short lived shun dynasty before this time the manchus had crossed the great wall multiple times to raid but this time it was for conquest the gates at shanhai pass were opened on may by the commanding ming general wu sangui who formed an alliance with the manchus hoping to use the manchus to expel the rebels from beijing the manchus quickly seized beijing and eventually defeated both the shun dynasty and the remaining ming resistance consolidating the rule of the qing dynasty over all of china proper under qing rule china s borders extended beyond the walls and mongolia was annexed into the empire so constructions on the great wall were discontinued on the other hand the so called willow palisade following a line similar to that of the ming liaodong wall was constructed by the qing rulers in manchuria its purpose however was not defense but rather to prevent han chinese migration into manchuria none of the europeans who visited china or mongolia in the th and th centuries such as giovanni da pian del carpine william of rubruck marco polo odoric of pordenone and giovanni de marignolli mentioned the great wall the north african traveler ibn battuta who also visited china during the yuan dynasty c had heard about china s great wall possibly before he had arrived in china he wrote that the wall is sixty days travel from zeitun modern quanzhou in his travelogue gift to those who contemplate the wonders of cities and the marvels of travelling he associated it with the legend of the wall mentioned in the qur an which dhul qarnayn commonly associated with alexander the great was said to have erected to protect people near the land of the rising sun from the savages of gog and magog however ibn battuta could find no one who had either seen it or knew of anyone who had seen it suggesting that although there were remnants of the wall at that time they were not significant soon after europeans reached ming china by ship in the early th century accounts of the great wall started to circulate in europe even though no european was to see it for another century possibly one of the earliest european descriptions of the wall and of its significance for the defense of the country against the tartars i e mongols may be the one contained in jo o de barros s asia other early accounts in western sources include those of gaspar da cruz bento de goes matteo ricci and bishop juan gonz lez de mendoza the latter in describing it as a superbious and mightie work of architecture though he had not seen it in in his work a treatise of china and the adjoyning regions gaspar da cruz offers an early discussion of the great wall perhaps the first recorded instance of a european actually entering china via the great wall came in when the portuguese jesuit brother bento de g is reached the northwestern jiayu pass from india early european accounts were mostly modest and empirical closely mirroring contemporary chinese understanding of the wall although later they slid into hyperbole including the erroneous but ubiquitous claim that the ming walls were the same ones that were built by the first emperor in the rd century bc when china opened its borders to foreign merchants and visitors after its defeat in the first and second opium wars the great wall became a main attraction for tourists the travelogues of the later th century further enhanced the reputation and the mythology of the great wall a formal definition of what constitutes a great wall has not been agreed upon making the full course of the great wall difficult to describe in its entirety the defensive lines contain multiple stretches of ramparts trenches and ditches as well as individual fortresses in based on existing research and the results of a comprehensive mapping survey the national cultural heritage administration of china concluded that the remaining great wall associated sites include wall sections ramparts or trenches individual buildings and fortifications or passes with the walls and trenches spanning a total length of km mi incorporating advanced technologies the study has concluded that the ming great wall measures km mi this consists of km mi of wall sections km mi of trenches and km mi of natural defensive barriers such as hills and rivers in addition qin han and earlier great wall sites are km mi long in total jin dynasty border fortifications are km mi in length the remainder date back to northern wei northern qi sui tang the five dynasties song liao and xixia about half of the sites are located in inner mongolia and hebei great wall of han dynasty near yumenguan ming dynasty great wall at jinshanling han fortifications starts from yumen pass and yang pass southwest of dunhuang in gansu province ruins of the remotest han border posts are found in mamitu t s m m t l horses losing their way near yumen pass the jiayu pass located in gansu province is the western terminus of the ming great wall from jiayu pass the wall travels discontinuously down the hexi corridor and into the deserts of ningxia where it enters the western edge of the yellow river loop at yinchuan here the first major walls erected during the ming dynasty cut through the ordos desert to the eastern edge of the yellow river loop there at piantou pass t s pi nt ugu n in xinzhou shanxi province the great wall splits in two with the outer great wall t s w i ch ngch ng extending along the inner mongolia border with shanxi into hebei province and the inner great wall t s n i ch ngch ng running southeast from piantou pass for some km mi passing through important passes like the pingxing pass and yanmen pass before joining the outer great wall at sihaiye s h iy in beijing s yanqing county the sections of the great wall around beijing municipality are especially famous they were frequently renovated and are regularly visited by tourists today the badaling great wall near zhangjiakou is the most famous stretch of the wall for this was the first section to be opened to the public in the people s republic of china as well as the showpiece stretch for foreign dignitaries the badaling great wall saw nearly million visitors in and in a daily limit of visitors was instated south of badaling is the juyong pass when it was used by the chinese to protect their land this section of the wall had many guards to defend the capital beijing made of stone and bricks from the hills this portion of the great wall is m ft in high and m ft in wide one of the most striking sections of the ming great wall is where it climbs extremely steep slopes in jinshanling there it runs km mi long ranges from to m ft in to ft in in height and m ft in across the bottom narrowing up to m ft in across the top wangjing lou t s w ngj ng l u is one of jinshanling s watchtowers m ft above sea level southeast of jinshanling is the mutianyu great wall which winds along lofty cragged mountains from the southeast to the northwest for km mi it is connected with juyongguan pass to the west and gubeikou to the east this section was one of the first to be renovated following the turmoil of the cultural revolution at the edge of the bohai gulf is shanhai pass considered the traditional end of the great wall and the first pass under heaven the part of the wall inside shanhai pass that meets the sea is named the old dragon head km mi north of shanhai pass is jiaoshan great wall t s ji osh n ch ngch ng the site of the first mountain of the great wall km mi northeast from shanhaiguan is jiumenkou t s ji m nk u which is the only portion of the wall that was built as a bridge in km of previously unknown sections of the ming wall concealed by hills trenches and rivers were discovered with the help of infrared range finders and gps devices in march and april nine sections with a total length of more than km mi believed to be part of the great wall were discovered along the border of ningxia autonomous region and gansu province before the use of bricks the great wall was mainly built from rammed earth stones and wood during the ming however bricks were heavily used in many areas of the wall as were materials such as tiles lime and stone the size and weight of the bricks made them easier to work with than earth and stone so construction quickened additionally bricks could bear more weight and endure better than rammed earth stone can hold under its own weight better than brick but is more difficult to use consequently stones cut into rectangular shapes were used for the foundation inner and outer brims and gateways of the wall battlements line the uppermost portion of the vast majority of the wall with defensive gaps a little over cm in tall and about cm in wide from the parapets guards could survey the surrounding land sticky rice mortar consisting of sticky rice soup mixed with slaked lime was extensively used to hold bricks together no human bones or body parts were ever incorporated into the mortar or any part of the wall contrary to what a legend states communication between the army units along the length of the great wall including the ability to call reinforcements and warn garrisons of enemy movements was of high importance signal towers were built upon hill tops or other high points along the wall for their visibility wooden gates could be used as a trap against those going through barracks stables and armories were built near the wall s inner surface while portions north of beijing and near tourist centers have been preserved and even extensively renovated in many other locations the wall is in disrepair the wall sometimes provided a source of stones to build houses and roads sections of the wall are also prone to graffiti and vandalism while inscribed bricks were pilfered and sold on the market for up to renminbi parts have been destroyed to make way for construction or mining a report by the national cultural heritage administration states that of the ming great wall has disappeared while km mi of wall have vanished more than km mi of the wall in gansu province may disappear in the next years due to erosion from sandstorms in some places the height of the wall has been reduced from more than m ft in to less than m ft in various square lookout towers that characterize the most famous images of the wall have disappeared many western sections of the wall are constructed from mud rather than brick and stone and thus are more susceptible to erosion in a portion of the wall near the border of liaoning and hebei province was repaired with concrete the work has been much criticized various factoids in popular culture claim that the great wall can be seen with the naked eye from space with questionable degrees of veracity the great wall of china cannot be seen by the naked human eye from the moon even though the myth is thoroughly debunked it is still ingrained in popular culture the apparent width of the great wall from the moon would be the same as that of a human hair viewed from km mi away one of the earliest known references to the myth that the great wall can be seen from the moon appears in a letter written in by the english antiquary william stukeley stukeley wrote that this mighty wall hadrian s wall of four score miles km in length is only exceeded by the chinese wall which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe and may be discerned at the moon the claim was also mentioned by henry norman in where he states besides its age it enjoys the reputation of being the only work of human hands on the globe visible from the moon the issue of canals on mars was prominent in the late th century and may have led to the belief that long thin objects were visible from space the claim that the great wall is visible from the moon also appears in s ripley s believe it or not strip a more controversial question is whether the wall is visible from low earth orbit an altitude of as little as km mi nasa claims that it is barely visible and only under nearly perfect conditions it is no more conspicuous than many other human made objects veteran us astronaut gene cernan has stated at earth orbit of to miles to km high the great wall of china is indeed visible to the naked eye ed lu expedition science officer aboard the international space station adds that it s less visible than a lot of other objects and you have to know where to look in october chinese astronaut yang liwei stated that he had not been able to see the great wall of china in response the european space agency esa issued a press release reporting that from an orbit between and km and mi the great wall is visible to the naked eye the image was actually a river in beijing leroy chiao a chinese american astronaut took a photograph from the international space station that shows the wall it was so indistinct that the photographer was not certain he had actually captured it based on the photograph the china daily later reported that the great wall can be seen from space with the naked eye under favorable viewing conditions if one knows exactly where

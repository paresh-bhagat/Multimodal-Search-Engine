 the eiffel tower a f l eye f l french tour eiffel tu f l listen is a wrought iron lattice tower on the champ de mars in paris france it is named after the engineer gustave eiffel citation needed whose company designed and built the tower locally nicknamed la dame de fer french for iron lady it was constructed from to as the centerpiece of the world s fair although initially criticised by some of france s leading artists and intellectuals for its design it has since become a global cultural icon of france and one of the most recognisable structures in the world the eiffel tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world million people ascended it in it was designated a monument historique in and was named part of a unesco world heritage site paris banks of the seine in the tower is metres ft tall about the same height as an storey building and the tallest structure in paris its base is square measuring metres ft on each side during its construction the eiffel tower surpassed the washington monument to become the tallest human made structure in the world a title it held for years until the chrysler building in new york city was finished in it was the first structure in the world to surpass both the metre and metre mark in height due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in it is now taller than the chrysler building by metres ft excluding transmitters the eiffel tower is the second tallest free standing structure in france after the millau viaduct the tower has three levels for visitors with restaurants on the first and second levels the top level s upper platform is m ft above the ground the highest observation deck accessible to the public in the european union tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels the climb from ground level to the first level is over steps as is the climb from the first level to the second making the entire ascent a step climb although there is a staircase to the top level it is usually accessible only by lift the design of the eiffel tower is attributed to maurice koechlin and mile nouguier two senior engineers working for the compagnie des tablissements eiffel it was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centerpiece for the proposed exposition universelle a world s fair to celebrate the centennial of the french revolution eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the latting observatory built in new york city in in may working at home koechlin made a sketch of their idea described by him as a great pylon consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm but he did approve further study and the two engineers then asked stephen sauvestre the head of the company s architectural department to contribute to the design sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower a glass pavilion to the first level and other embellishments the new version gained eiffel s support he bought the rights to the patent on the design which koechlin nougier and sauvestre had taken out and the design was put on display at the exhibition of decorative arts in the autumn of under the company name on march eiffel presented his plans to the soci t des ing nieurs civils after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise n ot only the art of the modern engineer but also the century of industry and science in which we are living and for which the way was prepared by the great scientific movement of the eighteenth century and by the revolution of to which this monument will be built as an expression of france s gratitude little progress was made until when jules gr vy was re elected as president of france and douard lockroy was appointed as minister for trade a budget for the exposition was passed and on may lockroy announced an alteration to the terms of the open competition being held for a centrepiece to the exposition which effectively made the selection of eiffel s design a foregone conclusion as entries had to include a study for a m ft four sided metal tower on the champ de mars a metre tower was then considered a herculean engineering effort on may a commission was set up to examine eiffel s scheme and its rivals which a month later decided that all the proposals except eiffel s were either impractical or lacking in details after some debate about the exact location of the tower a contract was signed on january eiffel signed it acting in his own capacity rather than as the representative of his company the contract granting him million francs toward the construction costs less than a quarter of the estimated million francs eiffel was to receive all income from the commercial exploitation of the tower during the exhibition and for the next years he later established a separate company to manage the tower putting up half the necessary capital himself the cr dit industriel et commercial c i c helped finance the construction of the eiffel tower according to a new york times investigation into france s colonial legacy in haiti at the time of the tower s construction the bank was acquiring funds from predatory loans related to the haiti indemnity controversy a debt forced upon haiti by france to pay for slaves lost following the haitian revolution and transferring haiti s wealth into france the times reported that the c i c benefited from a loan that required the haitian government to pay the bank and its partner nearly half of all taxes the haitian government collected on exports writing that by effectively choking off the nation s primary source of income the c i c left a crippling legacy of financial extraction and dashed hopes even by the standards of a nation with a long history of both the proposed tower had been a subject of controversy drawing criticism from those who did not believe it was feasible and those who objected on artistic grounds prior to the eiffel tower s construction no structure had ever been constructed to a height of m or even m for that matter and many people believed it was impossible these objections were an expression of a long standing debate in france about the relationship between architecture and engineering it came to a head as work began at the champ de mars a committee of three hundred one member for each metre of the tower s height was formed led by the prominent architect charles garnier and including some of the most important figures of the arts such as william adolphe bouguereau guy de maupassant charles gounod and jules massenet a petition called artists against the eiffel tower was sent to the minister of works and commissioner for the exposition adolphe alphand and it was published by le temps on february we writers painters sculptors architects and passionate devotees of the hitherto untouched beauty of paris protest with all our strength with all our indignation in the name of slighted french taste against the erection of this useless and monstrous eiffel tower to bring our arguments home imagine for a moment a giddy ridiculous tower dominating paris like a gigantic black smokestack crushing under its barbaric bulk notre dame the tour saint jacques the louvre the dome of les invalides the arc de triomphe all of our humiliated monuments will disappear in this ghastly dream and for twenty years we shall see stretching like a blot of ink the hateful shadow of the hateful column of bolted sheet metal gustave eiffel responded to these criticisms by comparing his tower to the egyptian pyramids my tower will be the tallest edifice ever erected by man will it not also be grandiose in its way and why would something admirable in egypt become hideous and ridiculous in paris these criticisms were also dealt with by douard lockroy in a letter of support written to alphand sardonically saying judging by the stately swell of the rhythms the beauty of the metaphors the elegance of its delicate and precise style one can tell this protest is the result of collaboration of the most famous writers and poets of our time and he explained that the protest was irrelevant since the project had been decided upon months before and construction on the tower was already under way indeed garnier was a member of the tower commission that had examined the various proposals and had raised no objection eiffel was similarly unworried pointing out to a journalist that it was premature to judge the effect of the tower solely on the basis of the drawings that the champ de mars was distant enough from the monuments mentioned in the protest for there to be little risk of the tower overwhelming them and putting the aesthetic argument for the tower do not the laws of natural forces always conform to the secret laws of harmony some of the protesters changed their minds when the tower was built others remained unconvinced guy de maupassant supposedly ate lunch in the tower s restaurant every day because it was the one place in paris where the tower was not visible by it had become a symbol of paris and of france after guillaume apollinaire wrote a nationalist poem in the shape of the tower a calligram to express his feelings about the war against germany today it is widely considered to be a remarkable piece of structural art and is often featured in films and literature work on the foundations started on january those for the east and south legs were straightforward with each leg resting on four m ft concrete slabs one for each of the principal girders of each leg the west and north legs being closer to the river seine were more complicated each slab needed two piles installed by using compressed air caissons m ft long and m ft in diameter driven to a depth of m ft to support the concrete slabs which were m ft thick each of these slabs supported a block of limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the ironwork each shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts cm in in diameter and m ft long the foundations were completed on june and the erection of the ironwork began the visible work on site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting preparatory work that took place behind the scenes the drawing office produced general drawings and detailed drawings of the different parts needed the task of drawing the components was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the degree of precision required the position of rivet holes was specified to within mm in and angles worked out to one second of arc the finished components some already riveted together into sub assemblies arrived on horse drawn carts from a factory in the nearby parisian suburb of levallois perret and were first bolted together with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction progressed no drilling or shaping was done on site if any part did not fit it was sent back to the factory for alteration in all pieces were joined together using million rivets at first the legs were constructed as cantilevers but about halfway to the first level construction was paused to create a substantial timber scaffold this renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the tower and sensational headlines such as eiffel suicide and gustave eiffel has gone mad he has been confined in an asylum appeared in the tabloid press at this stage a small creeper crane designed to move up the tower was installed in each leg they made use of the guides for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs the critical stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of march although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost attention to detail provision had been made to carry out small adjustments to precisely align the legs hydraulic jacks were fitted to the shoes at the base of each leg capable of exerting a force of tonnes and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly steeper angle than necessary being supported by sandboxes on the scaffold although construction involved on site employees due to eiffel s safety precautions and the use of movable gangways guardrails and screens only one person died july the start of the erection of the metalwork december construction of the legs with scaffolding march completion of the first level may start of construction on the second stage august completion of the second level december construction of the upper stage march construction of the cupola equipping the tower with adequate and safe passenger lifts was a major concern of the government commission overseeing the exposition although some visitors could be expected to climb to the first level or even the second lifts clearly had to be the main means of ascent constructing lifts to reach the first level was relatively straightforward the legs were wide enough at the bottom and so nearly straight that they could contain a straight track and a contract was given to the french company roux combaluzier lepape for two lifts to be fitted in the east and west legs roux combaluzier lepape used a pair of endless chains with rigid articulated links to which the car was attached lead weights on some links of the upper or return sections of the chains counterbalanced most of the car s weight the car was pushed up from below not pulled up from above to prevent the chain buckling it was enclosed in a conduit at the bottom of the run the chains passed around m ft in diameter sprockets smaller sprockets at the top guided the chains installing lifts to the second level was more of a challenge because a straight track was impossible no french company wanted to undertake the work the european branch of otis brothers company submitted a proposal but this was rejected the fair s charter ruled out the use of any foreign material in the construction of the tower the deadline for bids was extended but still no french companies put themselves forward and eventually the contract was given to otis in july otis were confident they would eventually be given the contract and had already started creating designs citation needed the car was divided into two superimposed compartments each holding passengers with the lift operator occupying an exterior platform on the first level motive power was provided by an inclined hydraulic ram m ft in long and cm in in diameter in the tower leg with a stroke of m ft in this moved a carriage carrying six sheaves five fixed sheaves were mounted higher up the leg producing an arrangement similar to a block and tackle but acting in reverse multiplying the stroke of the piston rather than the force generated the hydraulic pressure in the driving cylinder was produced by a large open reservoir on the second level after being exhausted from the cylinder the water was pumped back up to the reservoir by two pumps in the machinery room at the base of the south leg this reservoir also provided power to the lifts to the first level citation needed the original lifts for the journey between the second and third levels were supplied by l on edoux a pair of m ft hydraulic rams were mounted on the second level reaching nearly halfway up to the third level one lift car was mounted on top of these rams cables ran from the top of this car up to sheaves on the third level and back down to a second car each car travelled only half the distance between the second and third levels and passengers were required to change lifts halfway by means of a short gangway the ton cars each held passengers the main structural work was completed at the end of march and on march eiffel celebrated by leading a group of government officials accompanied by representatives of the press to the top of the tower because the lifts were not yet in operation the ascent was made by foot and took over an hour with eiffel stopping frequently to explain various features most of the party chose to stop at the lower levels but a few including the structural engineer mile nouguier the head of construction jean compagnon the president of the city council and reporters from le figaro and le monde illustr completed the ascent at pm eiffel hoisted a large tricolour to the accompaniment of a gun salute fired at the first level there was still work to be done particularly on the lifts and facilities and the tower was not opened to the public until nine days after the opening of the exposition on may even then the lifts had not been completed the tower was an instant success with the public and nearly visitors made the step climb to the top before the lifts entered service on may tickets cost francs for the first level for the second and for the top with half price admission on sundays and by the end of the exhibition there had been visitors after dark the tower was lit by hundreds of gas lamps and a beacon sent out three beams of red white and blue light two searchlights mounted on a circular rail were used to illuminate various buildings of the exposition the daily opening and closing of the exposition were announced by a cannon at the top citation needed on the second level the french newspaper le figaro had an office and a printing press where a special souvenir edition le figaro de la tour was made there was also a p tisserie citation needed at the top there was a post office where visitors could send letters and postcards as a memento of their visit graffitists were also catered for sheets of paper were mounted on the walls each day for visitors to record their impressions of the tower gustave eiffel described some of the responses as vraiment curieuse truly curious famous visitors to the tower included the prince of wales sarah bernhardt buffalo bill cody his wild west show was an attraction at the exposition and thomas edison eiffel invited edison to his private apartment at the top of the tower where edison presented him with one of his phonographs a new invention and one of the many highlights of the exposition edison signed the guestbook with this message to m eiffel the engineer the brave builder of so gigantic and original specimen of modern engineering from one who has the greatest respect and admiration for all engineers including the great engineer the bon dieu thomas edison eiffel had a permit for the tower to stand for years it was to be dismantled in when its ownership would revert to the city of paris the city had planned to tear it down part of the original contest rules for designing a tower was that it should be easy to dismantle but as the tower proved to be valuable for radio telegraphy it was allowed to remain after the expiry of the permit and from it also became part of the international time service eiffel made use of his apartment at the top of the tower to carry out meteorological observations and also used the tower to perform experiments on the action of air resistance on falling bodies for the exposition universelle the lifts in the east and west legs were replaced by lifts running as far as the second level constructed by the french firm fives lille these had a compensating mechanism to keep the floor level as the angle of ascent changed at the first level and were driven by a similar hydraulic mechanism as the otis lifts although this was situated at the base of the tower hydraulic pressure was provided by pressurised accumulators located near this mechanism at the same time the lift in the north pillar was removed and replaced by a staircase to the first level the layout of both first and second levels was modified with the space available for visitors on the second level the original lift in the south pillar was removed years later citation needed on october alberto santos dumont flying his no airship won a franc prize offered by henri deutsch de la meurthe for the first person to make a flight from st cloud to the eiffel tower and back in less than half an hour many innovations took place at the eiffel tower in the early th century in father theodor wulf measured radiant energy at the top and bottom of the tower he found more at the top than expected incidentally discovering what are known today as cosmic rays two years later on february austrian tailor franz reichelt died after jumping from the first level of the tower a height of m to demonstrate his parachute design in at the outbreak of world war i a radio transmitter located in the tower jammed german radio communications seriously hindering their advance on paris and contributing to the allied victory at the first battle of the marne from to illuminated signs for citro n adorned three of the tower s sides making it the tallest advertising space in the world at the time in april the tower was used to make experimental low resolution television transmissions using a shortwave transmitter of watts power on november an improved line transmitter was installed on two separate but related occasions in the con artist victor lustig sold the tower for scrap metal a year later in february pilot leon collet was killed trying to fly under the tower his aircraft became entangled in an aerial belonging to a wireless station a bust of gustave eiffel by antoine bourdelle was unveiled at the base of the north leg on may in the tower lost the title of the world s tallest structure when the chrysler building in new york city was completed in the decorative arcade around the first level was removed upon the german occupation of paris in the lift cables were cut by the french the tower was closed to the public during the occupation and the lifts were not repaired until in german soldiers had to climb the tower to hoist a swastika centered reichskriegsflagge but the flag was so large it blew away just a few hours later and was replaced by a smaller one when visiting paris hitler chose to stay on the ground when the allies were nearing paris in august hitler ordered general dietrich von choltitz the military governor of paris to demolish the tower along with the rest of the city von choltitz disobeyed the order on august before the germans had been driven out of paris the german flag was replaced with a tricolour by two men from the french naval museum who narrowly beat three men led by lucien sarniguet who had lowered the tricolour on june when paris fell to the germans a fire started in the television transmitter on january damaging the top of the tower repairs took a year and in the present radio aerial was added to the top in the eiffel tower was officially declared to be a historical monument by the minister of cultural affairs andr malraux a year later an additional lift system was installed in the north pillar according to interviews in montreal mayor jean drapeau negotiated a secret agreement with charles de gaulle for the tower to be dismantled and temporarily relocated to montreal to serve as a landmark and tourist attraction during expo the plan was allegedly vetoed by the company operating the tower out of fear that the french government could refuse permission for the tower to be restored in its original location in the original lifts between the second and third levels were replaced after years in service these had been closed to the public between november and march because the water in the hydraulic drive tended to freeze the new cars operate in pairs with one counterbalancing the other and perform the journey in one stage reducing the journey time from eight minutes to less than two minutes at the same time two new emergency staircases were installed replacing the original spiral staircases in the south pillar was fitted with an electrically driven otis lift to serve the jules verne restaurant citation needed the fives lille lifts in the east and west legs fitted in were extensively refurbished in the cars were replaced and a computer system was installed to completely automate the lifts the motive power was moved from the water hydraulic system to a new electrically driven oil filled hydraulic system and the original water hydraulics were retained solely as a counterbalance system a service lift was added to the south pillar for moving small loads and maintenance personnel three years later citation needed robert moriarty flew a beechcraft bonanza under the tower on march in a j hackett made one of his first bungee jumps from the top of the eiffel tower using a special cord he had helped develop hackett was arrested by the police on october thierry devaux along with mountain guide herv calvayrac performed a series of acrobatic figures while bungee jumping from the second floor of the tower facing the champ de mars devaux used an electric winch between figures to go back up to the second floor when firemen arrived he stopped after the sixth jump for its countdown to the year celebration on december flashing lights and high powered searchlights were installed on the tower during the last three minutes of the year the lights were turned on starting from the base of the tower and continuing to the top to welcome with a huge fireworks show an exhibition above a cafeteria on the first floor commemorates this event the searchlights on top of the tower made it a beacon in paris s night sky and flashing bulbs gave the tower a sparkly appearance for five minutes every hour on the hour the lights sparkled blue for several nights to herald the new millennium on december the sparkly lighting continued for months until july the sparkling lights were turned on again on june and the display was planned to last for years before they needed replacing the tower received its th guest on november the tower has operated at its maximum capacity of about million visitors per year since in the eiffel tower began hosting a seasonal ice rink on the first level a glass floor was installed on the first level during the refurbishment the puddle iron wrought iron of the eiffel tower weighs tonnes and the addition of lifts shops and antennae have brought the total weight to approximately tonnes as a demonstration of the economy of design if the tonnes of metal in the structure were melted down it would fill the square base metres ft on each side to a depth of only cm in assuming the density of the metal to be tonnes per cubic metre additionally a cubic box surrounding the tower m m m would contain tonnes of air weighing almost as much as the iron itself depending on the ambient temperature the top of the tower may shift away from the sun by up to cm in due to thermal expansion of the metal on the side facing the sun when it was built many were shocked by the tower s daring form eiffel was accused of trying to create something artistic with no regard to the principles of engineering however eiffel and his team experienced bridge builders understood the importance of wind forces and knew that if they were going to build the tallest structure in the world they had to be sure it could withstand them in an interview with the newspaper le temps published on february eiffel said is it not true that the very conditions which give strength also conform to the hidden rules of harmony now to what phenomenon did i have to give primary concern in designing the tower it was wind resistance well then i hold that the curvature of the monument s four outer edges which is as mathematical calculation dictated it should be will give a great impression of strength and beauty for it will reveal to the eyes of the observer the boldness of the design as a whole he used graphical methods to determine the strength of the tower and empirical evidence to account for the effects of wind rather than a mathematical formula close examination of the tower reveals a basically exponential shape all parts of the tower were overdesigned to ensure maximum resistance to wind forces the top half was even assumed to have no gaps in the latticework in the years since it was completed engineers have put forward various mathematical hypotheses in an attempt to explain the success of the design the most recent devised in after letters sent by eiffel to the french society of civil engineers in were translated into english is described as a non linear integral equation based on counteracting the wind pressure on any point of the tower with the tension between the construction elements at that point the eiffel tower sways by up to cm in in the wind when originally built the first level contained three restaurants one french one russian and one flemish and an anglo american bar after the exposition closed the flemish restaurant was converted to a seat theatre a promenade metre ft in wide ran around the outside of the first level at the top there were laboratories for various experiments and a small apartment reserved for gustave eiffel to entertain guests which is now open to the public complete with period decorations and lifelike mannequins of eiffel and some of his notable guests in may an apartment was created on the first level to accommodate four competition winners during the uefa euro football tournament in paris in june the apartment has a kitchen two bedrooms a lounge and views of paris landmarks including the seine sacr c ur and the arc de triomphe the arrangement of the lifts has been changed several times during the tower s history given the elasticity of the cables and the time taken to align the cars with the landings each lift in normal service takes an average of minutes and seconds to do the round trip spending an average of minute and seconds at each level the average journey time between levels is minute the original hydraulic mechanism is on public display in a small museum at the base of the east and west legs because the mechanism requires frequent lubrication and maintenance public access is often restricted the rope mechanism of the north tower can be seen as visitors exit the lift gustave eiffel engraved on the tower the names of french scientists engineers and mathematicians in recognition of their contributions to the building of the tower eiffel chose this invocation of science because of his concern over the artists protest at the beginning of the th century the engravings were painted over but they were restored in by the soci t nouvelle d exploitation de la tour eiffel a company operating the tower the tower is painted in three shades lighter at the top getting progressively darker towards the bottom to complement the parisian sky it was originally reddish brown this changed in to a bronze colour known as eiffel tower brown in what is expected to be a temporary change the tower is being painted gold in commemoration of the upcoming summer olympics in paris the only non structural elements are the four decorative grill work arches added in sauvestre s sketches which served to make the tower look more substantial and to make a more impressive entrance to the exposition a pop culture movie clich is that the view from a parisian window always includes the tower in reality since zoning restrictions limit the height of most buildings in paris to seven storeys only a small number of tall buildings have a clear view of the tower maintenance of the tower includes applying tons of paint every seven years to prevent it from rusting the tower has been completely repainted at least times since it was built lead paint was still being used as recently as when the practice was stopped out of concern for the environment the nearest paris m tro station is bir hakeim and the nearest rer station is champ de mars tour eiffel the tower itself is located at the intersection of the quai branly and the pont d i na more than million people have visited the tower since it was completed in in there were million visitors the tower is the most visited paid monument in the world an average of people ascend the tower every day which can result in long queues the tower has two restaurants le tour eiffel on the first level and le jules verne a gourmet restaurant with its own lift on the second level this restaurant has one star in the michelin red guide it was run by the multi michelin star chef alain ducasse from to starting may it will be managed by three star chef fr d ric anton it owes its name to the famous science fiction writer jules verne additionally there is a champagne bar at the top of the eiffel tower from until there was a restaurant near the top of the tower it was removed due to structural considerations engineers had determined it was too heavy and was causing the tower to sag this restaurant was sold to an american restaurateur and transported to new york and then new orleans it was rebuilt on the edge of new orleans garden district as a restaurant and later event hall as one of the most iconic landmarks in the world the eiffel tower has been the inspiration for the creation of many replicas and similar towers an early example is blackpool tower in england the mayor of blackpool sir john bickerstaffe was so impressed on seeing the eiffel tower at the exposition that he commissioned a similar tower to be built in his town it opened in and is m ft tall tokyo tower in japan built as a communications tower in was also inspired by the eiffel tower there are various scale models of the tower in the united states including a half scale version at the paris las vegas nevada one in paris texas built in and two scale models at kings island located in mason ohio and kings dominion virginia amusement parks opened in and respectively two scale models can be found in china one in durango mexico that was donated by the local french community and several across europe in the tv show pricing the priceless on the national geographic channel speculated that a full size replica of the tower would cost approximately us million to build this would be more than ten times the cost of the original nearly million in francs us million in dollars the tower has been used for making radio transmissions since the beginning of the th century until the s sets of aerial wires ran from the cupola to anchors on the avenue de suffren and champ de mars these were connected to longwave transmitters in small bunkers in a permanent underground radio centre was built near the south pillar which still exists today on november the paris observatory using the eiffel tower as an aerial exchanged wireless signals with the united states naval observatory which used an aerial in arlington county virginia the object of the transmissions was to measure the difference in longitude between paris and washington d c today radio and digital television signals are transmitted from the eiffel tower a television antenna was first installed on the tower in increasing its height by m ft work carried out in added a further m ft giving the current height of m ft analogue television signals from the eiffel tower ceased on march the tower and its image have been in the public domain since years after eiffel s death in june a french court ruled that a special lighting display on the tower in to mark the tower s th anniversary was an original visual creation protected by copyright the court of cassation france s judicial court of last resort upheld the ruling in march the soci t d exploitation de la tour eiffel sete now considers any illumination of the tower to be a separate work of art that falls under copyright as a result the snte alleges that it is illegal to publish contemporary photographs of the lit tower at night without permission in france and some other countries for commercial use for this reason it is often rare to find images or videos of the lit tower at night on stock image sites and media outlets rarely broadcast images or videos of it the imposition of copyright has been controversial the director of documentation for what was then called the soci t nouvelle d exploitation de la tour eiffel snte st phane dieu commented in it is really just a way to manage commercial use of the image so that it isn t used in ways of which we don t approve snte made over million from copyright fees in however it could also be used to restrict the publication of tourist photographs of the tower at night as well as hindering non profit and semi commercial publication of images of the illuminated tower the copyright claim itself has never been tested in courts to date according to a article in the art law journal and there has never been an attempt to track down millions of netizens who have posted and shared their images of the illuminated tower on the internet worldwide it added however that permissive situation may arise on commercial use of such images like in a magazine on a film poster or on product packaging french doctrine and jurisprudence allows pictures incorporating a copyrighted work as long as their presence is incidental or accessory to the subject being represented a reasoning akin to the de minimis rule therefore sete may be unable to claim copyright on photographs of paris which happen to include the lit tower the pinnacle height of the eiffel tower has changed multiple times over the years as described in the chart below the eiffel tower was the world s tallest structure when completed in a distinction it retained until when the chrysler building in new york city was topped out the tower also lost its standing as the world s tallest tower to the tokyo tower in but retains its status as the tallest freestanding non guyed structure in france

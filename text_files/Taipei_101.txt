and the world s largest new year s eve countdown clock various sources including the building s owners give the height of taipei as m ft roof height and top floor height as m ft and m ft this lower figure is derived by measuring from the top of a m ft in platform at the base ctbuh standards though include the height of the platform in calculating the overall height as it represents part of the

elevator at miles per hour it also has the largest wind damper in the world at feet across taipei is currently the eleventh tallest building in the world according to the council on tall buildings and urban habitat s official rankings the taipei is designed to withstand typhoon winds and earthquake tremors that are common in the area in the east of taiwan evergreen consulting engineering the structural engineer designed taipei to withstand gale winds of meters per second ft s km h or mph as well as the strongest earthquakes in a year cycle taipei was designed to be flexible as well as structurally resistant because while flexibility prevents structural damage resistance ensures comfort both for the occupants and for the protection of the glass curtain walls and other features most designs achieve the necessary strength by enlarging critical structural elements such as bracing because of the height of taipei combined with the surrounding area s geology the building is located just ft m away from a major fault line taipei used high performance steel construction and columns including eight mega columns packed with psi mpa concrete outrigger trusses located at eight floor intervals connect the columns in the building s core to those on the exterior these features combined with the solidity of its foundation made taipei one of the most stable buildings ever constructed citation needed the foundation is reinforced by piles driven m ft into the ground extending as far as m ft into the bedrock each pile is m ft in in diameter and can bear a load of metric tons short tons during construction on march a magnitude earthquake rocked taipei two construction cranes from the th floor the highest floor at the time toppled five people died in the accident but an inspection showed no structural damage to the building and construction soon resumed duplication rwdi designed a metric ton short ton steel pendulum that serves as a tuned mass damper at a cost of nt million us million suspended from the nd to the th floor the pendulum sways to offset movements in the building caused by strong gusts duplication citation needed its ball the largest damper ball in the world consists of circular steel plates of varying diameters each mm in thick welded together to form a meter diameter ft ball two additional tuned mass dampers each weighing metric tons short tons are installed at the tip of the spire which help prevent damage to the structure due to strong wind loads on august strong winds from typhoon soudelor swayed the main damper by meter in the largest movement ever recorded by the damper the damper has become such a popular tourist attraction that the city contracted sanrio to create a mascot the damper baby four versions of the damper baby rich gold cool black smart silver and lucky red were designed and made into figurines and souvenirs sold in various taipei gift shops damper baby has become a popular local icon with its own comic book and website taipei s characteristic blue green glass curtain walls are double paned and glazed offer heat and uv protection sufficient to block external heat by percent and can sustain impacts of metric tons short tons the facade system of glass and aluminum panels installed into an inclined movement resisting lattice contributes to overall lateral rigidity by tying back to the mega columns with one story high trusses at every eighth floor this facade system is therefore able to withstand up to mm in of seismic lateral displacements without damage the facade system is also known as a damper the original corners of the facade were tested at rwdi in ontario canada a simulation of a year storm at rwdi revealed a vortex that formed during a second mile per hour km h wind at a height of meters or equivalent to the lateral tower sway rate causing large crosswind oscillations a double chamfered step design was found to dramatically reduce this crosswind oscillation resulting in the final design s double stairstep corner facade architect c y lee also used extensive facade elements to represent the symbolic identity he pursued these facade elements included the green tinted glass for the indigenous slender bamboo look eight upper outwards inclined tiers of pagoda each with eight floors a ruyi and a money box symbol between the two facade sections among others taipei s own roof and facade recycled water system meets to percent of the building s water needs in july taipei was certified the world s tallest green building under leed standards the height of floors commemorates the renewal of time the new century that arrived as the tower was built and all the new years that follow january it symbolizes lofty ideals by going one better on a traditional number of perfection the number also evokes the binary numeral system used in digital technology the main tower features a series of eight segments of eight floors each in chinese speaking cultures the number eight is associated with abundance prosperity and good fortune the repeated segments simultaneously recall the rhythms of an asian pagoda a tower linking earth and sky also evoked in the petronas towers a stalk of bamboo an icon of learning and growth and a stack of ancient chinese ingots or money boxes a symbol of abundance popular humor sometimes likens the building s shape to a stack of take out boxes as used in western style chinese food of course the stackable shape of such boxes is likewise derived from that of ancient money boxes the four discs mounted on each face of the building where the pedestal meets the tower represent coins the emblem placed over entrances shows three gold coins of ancient chinese design with central holes shaped to imply the arabic numerals the structure incorporates many shapes of squares and circles to reach a balance between yin and yang curled ruyi figures appear throughout the structure as a design motif though the shape of each ruyi at taipei is traditional its rendering in industrial metal is plainly modern the ruyi is a talisman of ancient origin associated in art with heavenly clouds it connotes healing protection and fulfillment it appears in celebrations of the attainment of new career heights the sweeping curved roof of the adjoining mall culminates in a colossal ruyi that shades pedestrians each ruyi ornament on the exterior of the taipei tower stands at least m ft tall at night the bright yellow gleam from its pinnacle casts taipei in the role of a candle or torch upholding the ideals of liberty and welcome from to p m the tower s lights display one of seven colors according to a weekly schedule from february to march the typical colors were replaced by blue and yellow in solidarity with ukraine in response to the russian invasion of ukraine the adjoining taipei on the east side connects the landmark further with the symbolism of time the design of the circular park doubles as the face of a giant sundial the tower itself casts the shadow to mark afternoon hours for the building s occupants the park s design is echoed in a clock that stands at its entrance the clock runs on energy drawn from the building s wind shear taipei like many of its neighboring buildings exemplifies the influence of feng shui philosophy an example appears in the form of a large granite fountain at the intersection of songlian road and xinyi road near the tower s east entrance a ball at the fountain s top spins toward the tower as a work of public art the fountain offers a contrast to the tower in texture even as its design echoes the tower s rhythms the fountain also serves a practical function in feng shui philosophy a t intersection near the entrance of a building represents a potential drain of positive energy or ch i from the structure and its occupants placing flowing water at such spots is thought to help redirect the flow of ch i taipei is the first record setting skyscraper to be constructed in the st century it exhibits a number of technologically advanced features as it provides a center for business and recreation the original fiber optic and satellite internet connections permitted transfer

architecture prize wrote of the london eye in a book about the project the eye has done for london what the eiffel tower did for paris which is to give it a symbol and to let people climb above the city and look back down on it not just specialists or rich people but everybody that s the beauty of it it is public and accessible and it is in a great position at the heart of london big city review wrote that if you re an amateur or professional photographer the london eye delivers the chance to get breathtaking photos of the city of london the ride moves so slow which enables one to have ample opportunity to shoot photos and video from all angles when your sic done shooting your photos the ride s slow speed lets you just sit back and take in the incredible views of london from the time your carriage reaches the highest point your breath will have been take away that is why the london eye is worth visiting the nearest london underground station is waterloo although charing cross embankment and westminster are also within easy walking distance connection with national rail services is made at london waterloo station and london waterloo east station london river services

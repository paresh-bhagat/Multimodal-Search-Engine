 the taj mahal t d m h l t lit crown of the palace is an islamic ivory white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river yamuna in the indian city of agra it was commissioned in by the mughal emperor shah jahan r to house the tomb of his favourite wife mumtaz mahal it also houses the tomb of shah jahan himself the tomb is the centrepiece of a hectare acre complex which includes a mosque and a guest house and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in but work continued on other phases of the project for another years the taj mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in at a cost estimated at the time to be around million which in would be approximately billion about us billion the construction project employed some artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor ustad ahmad lahauri various types of symbolism have been employed in the taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity the taj mahal was designated as a unesco world heritage site in for being the jewel of muslim art in india and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world s heritage it is regarded by many as the best example of mughal architecture and a symbol of india s rich history the taj mahal attracts more than million visitors a year and in it was declared a winner of the new wonders of the world initiative abdul hamid lahauri in his book from padshahnama refers to the taj mahal as rauza i munawwara perso arabic rawdah i munawwarah meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb the current name for the taj mahal is believed to be derived from the persian t j mahall meaning crown t j palace mahall the name taj came from the corruption of the second syllable of mumtaz the taj mahal was commissioned by shah jahan in to be built in the memory of his wife mumtaz mahal who died on june that year while giving birth to their th child gauhara begum construction started in and the mausoleum was completed in while the surrounding buildings and garden were finished five years later the imperial court documenting shah jahan s grief after the death of mumtaz mahal illustrates the love story held as the inspiration for the taj mahal shah jahan on a globe from the smithsonian institution artistic depiction of mumtaz mahal the taj mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of indo islamic and earlier mughal architecture specific inspiration came from successful timurid and mughal buildings including the gur e amir the tomb of timur progenitor of the mughal dynasty in samarkand humayun s tomb which inspired the charbagh gardens and hasht behesht architecture plan of the site itmad ud daulah s tomb sometimes called the baby taj and shah jahan s own jama masjid in delhi while earlier mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone shah jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi precious stones buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement the tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the taj mahal it is a large white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan an arch shaped doorway topped by a large dome and finial like most mughal tombs the basic elements are indo islamic in origin the base structure is a large multi chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight sided structure that is approximately metres ft on each of the four long sides each side of the iwan is framed with a huge pishtaq or vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side this motif of stacked pishtaqs is replicated on the chamfered corner areas making the design completely symmetrical on all sides of the building four minarets frame the tomb one at each corner of the plinth facing the chamfered corners the main chamber houses the false sarcophagi of mumtaz mahal and shah jahan the actual graves are at a lower level taj mahal agra india the mausoleum rauza i munnauwara the main gateway darwaza to the taj mahal taj mahal minaret taj mahal at sunrise from

dome smaller domes and decorative spires that extend from the edges of the base walls arabic calligraphy at the tomb entrance a window view of taj mahal from agra fort the most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the tomb the dome is nearly metres ft high which is close in measurement to the length of the base and accentuated by the cylindrical drum it sits on which is approximately metres ft high because of its shape the dome is often called an onion dome or amrud guava dome the top is decorated with a lotus design which also serves to accentuate its height the shape of the dome is emphasised by four smaller domed chattris kiosks placed at its corners which replicate the onion shape of the main dome the dome is slightly asymmetrical their columned bases open through the roof of the tomb and provide light to the interior tall decorative spires guldastas extend from edges of base walls and provide visual emphasis to the height of the dome the lotus motif is repeated on both the chattris and guldastas the dome and chattris are topped by a gilded finial which mixes traditional persian and hindustani decorative elements the main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early th century this feature provides a clear example of integration of traditional persian and hindu decorative elements the finial is topped by a moon a typical islamic motif whose horns point heavenward the minarets which are each more than metres ft tall display the designer s penchant for symmetry they were designed as working minarets a traditional element of mosques used by the muezzin to call the islamic faithful to prayer each minaret is effectively divided into three equal parts by two working balconies that ring the tower at the top of the tower is a final balcony surmounted by a chattri that mirrors the design of those on the tomb the chattris all share the same decorative elements of a lotus design topped by a gilded finial the minarets were constructed slightly outside of the plinth so that in the event of collapse a typical occurrence with many tall constructions of the period the material from the towers would tend to fall away from the tomb the exterior decorations of the taj mahal are among the finest in mughal architecture as the surface area changes the decorations are refined proportionally the decorative elements were created by applying paint stucco stone inlays or carvings in line with the islamic prohibition against the use of anthropomorphic forms the decorative elements can be grouped into either calligraphy abstract forms or vegetative motifs throughout the complex are passages from the qur an that comprise some of the decorative elements recent scholarship suggests that amanat khan chose the passages the calligraphy on the great gate reads o soul thou art at rest return to the lord at peace with him and he at peace with you the calligraphy was created in by a calligrapher named abdul haq shah jahan conferred the title of amanat khan upon him as a reward for his dazzling virtuosity near the lines from the qur an at the base of the interior dome is the inscription written by the insignificant being amanat khan shirazi much of the calligraphy is composed of florid thuluth script made of jasper or black marble inlaid in white marble panels higher panels are written in slightly larger script to reduce the skewing effect when viewed from below the calligraphy found on the marble cenotaphs in the tomb is particularly detailed and delicate citation needed abstract forms are used throughout especially in the plinth minarets gateway mosque jawab and to a lesser extent on the surfaces of the tomb the domes and vaults of the sandstone buildings are worked with tracery of incised painting to create elaborate geometric forms herringbone inlays define the space between many of the adjoining elements white inlays are used in sandstone buildings and dark or black inlays on the white marbles mortared areas of the marble buildings have been stained or painted in a contrasting colour which creates a complex citation needed array of geometric patterns floors and walkways use contrasting tiles or blocks in tessellation patterns on the lower walls of the tomb are white marble dados sculpted with realistic bas relief depictions of flowers and vines the marble has been polished to emphasise the exquisite detailing of the carvings the dado frames and archway spandrels have been decorated with pietra dura inlays of highly stylised almost geometric vines flowers and fruits the inlay stones are of yellow marble jasper and jade polished and levelled to the surface of the walls taj mahal exterior with a minaret detail of plant motifs on taj mahal wall base dome and minaret finial tamga of the mughal empire plant motifs reflective tiles marble jali lattice calligraphy of arabic ayaat the interior chamber of the taj mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements the inlay work is not pietra dura but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones the inner chamber is an octagon with the design allowing for entry from each face although only the door facing the garden to the south is used the interior walls are about metres ft high and are topped by a false interior dome decorated with a sun motif eight pishtaq arches define the space at ground level and as with the exterior each lower pishtaq is crowned by a second pishtaq about midway up the wall the four central upper arches form balconies or viewing areas and each balcony s exterior window has an intricate screen or jali cut from marble in addition to the light from the balcony screens light enters through roof openings covered by chattris at the corners the octagonal marble screen or jali bordering the cenotaphs is made from eight marble panels carved through with intricate pierce work the remaining surfaces are inlaid in delicate detail with semi precious stones forming twining vines fruits and flowers each chamber wall is highly decorated with dado bas relief intricate lapidary inlay and refined calligraphy panels which reflect in little detail the design elements seen throughout the exterior of the complex flowers carved in marble detail of pietra dura jali inlay delicacy of intricate pierce work archways in the mosque incised painting finial floor tiling detail of jali pietra dura or parchin kari flowers muslim tradition forbids elaborate decoration of graves hence the bodies of mumtaz and shah jahan were put in a relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned right towards mecca mumtaz mahal s cenotaph is placed at the precise centre of the inner chamber on a rectangular marble base of by metres ft in by ft in both the base and casket are elaborately inlaid with precious and semiprecious gems calligraphic inscriptions on the casket identify and praise mumtaz on the lid of the casket is a raised rectangular lozenge meant to suggest a writing tablet shah jahan s cenotaph is beside mumtaz s to the western side and is the only visible asymmetric element in the entire complex his cenotaph is bigger than his wife s but reflects the same elements a larger casket on a slightly taller base precisely decorated with lapidary and calligraphy that identifies him on the lid of the casket is a traditional sculpture of a small pen box the pen box and writing tablet are traditional mughal funerary icons decorating the caskets of men and women respectively the ninety nine names of god are calligraphic inscriptions on the sides of the actual tomb of mumtaz mahal other inscriptions inside the crypt include o noble o magnificent o majestic o unique o eternal o glorious the tomb of shah jahan bears a calligraphic inscription that reads he travelled from this world to the banquet hall of eternity on the night of the twenty sixth of the month of rajab in the year hijri the complex is set around a large metre ft square charbagh or mughal garden the garden uses raised pathways that divide each of the four quarters of the garden into sunken parterres or flowerbeds halfway between the tomb and gateway in the centre of the garden is a raised marble water tank with a reflecting pool positioned on a north south axis to reflect the image of the mausoleum the elevated marble water tank is called al hawd al kawthar in reference to the tank of abundance promised to muhammad elsewhere the garden is laid out with avenues of trees labeled according to common and scientific names and fountains the charbagh garden a design inspired by persian gardens was introduced to india by babur the first mughal emperor it symbolises the four flowing rivers of jannah paradise and reflects the paradise garden derived from the persian paridaeza meaning walled garden in mystic islamic texts of the mughal period paradise is described as an ideal garden of abundance with four rivers flowing from a central spring or mountain separating the garden into north west south and east citation needed most mughal charbaghs are rectangular with a tomb or pavilion in the centre the taj mahal garden is unusual in that the main element the tomb is located at the end of the garden with the discovery of mahtab bagh or moonlight garden on the other side of the yamuna the interpretation of the archaeological survey of india is that the yamuna river itself was incorporated into the garden s design and was meant to be seen as one of the rivers of paradise similarities in layout and architectural features with the shalimar gardens suggests both gardens may have been designed by the same architect ali mardan early accounts of the garden describe its profusion of vegetation including abundant roses daffodils and fruit trees as the mughal empire declined the taj mahal and its gardens also declined by the end of the th century the british empire controlled more than three fifths of india and assumed management of the taj mahal they changed the landscaping to their liking which more closely resembled the formal lawns of london the taj mahal complex is bordered on three sides by crenellated red sandstone walls the side facing the river is open outside the walls are several additional mausoleums including those of shah jahan s other wives and a larger tomb for mumtaz s favourite servant citation needed these structures composed primarily of red sandstone are typical of the smaller mughal tombs of the era the garden facing inner sides of the wall are fronted by columned arcades a feature typical of hindu temples which was later incorporated into mughal mosques the wall is interspersed with domed chattris and small buildings that may have been viewing areas or watch towers like the music house which is now used as a museum citation needed the main gateway darwaza is a monumental structure built primarily of marble and reminiscent of the mughal architecture of earlier emperors its archways mirror the shape of the tomb s archways and its pishtaq arches incorporate the calligraphy that decorates the tomb it utilises bas relief and pietra dura inlaid decorations with floral motifs the vaulted ceilings and walls have elaborate geometric designs like those found in the other sandstone buildings in the complex citation needed at the far end of the complex are two grand red sandstone buildings that mirror each other and face the sides of the tomb the backs of the buildings parallel the western and eastern walls the western building is a mosque and the other is the jawab answer thought to have been constructed for architectural balance although it may have been used as a guesthouse distinctions between the two buildings include the jawab s lack of a mihrab a niche in a mosque s wall facing mecca and its floors of geometric design whereas the floor of the mosque is laid with outlines of prayer rugs in black marble the mosque s basic design of a long hall surmounted by three domes is similar to others built by shah jahan particularly the masjid i jah n num or jama masjid delhi the mughal mosques of this period divide the sanctuary hall into three areas comprising a main sanctuary and slightly smaller sanctuaries on either side at the taj mahal each sanctuary opens onto an expansive vaulting dome the outlying buildings were completed in the taj mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of agra shah jahan presented maharajah jai singh with a large palace in the centre of agra in exchange for the land an area of roughly hectares acres was excavated filled with dirt to reduce seepage and levelled at metres ft above riverbank in the tomb area wells were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb instead of lashed bamboo workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb the scaffold was so enormous that foremen estimated it would take years to dismantle the taj mahal was constructed using materials from all over india and asia it is believed over elephants were used to transport building materials it took the efforts of labourers painters embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the taj mahal the translucent white marble was brought from makrana rajasthan the jasper from punjab jade and crystal from china the turquoise was from tibet and the lapis lazuli from afghanistan while the sapphire came from sri lanka and the carnelian from arabia in all twenty eight types of precious and semi precious stones were inlaid into the white marble citation needed according to the legend shah jahan decreed that anyone could keep the bricks taken from the scaffold and thus it was dismantled by peasants overnight a kilometre mi tamped earth ramp was built to transport marble and materials to the construction site and teams of twenty or thirty oxen pulled the blocks on specially constructed wagons an elaborate post and beam pulley system was used to raise the blocks into desired position water was drawn from the river by a series of purs an animal powered rope and bucket mechanism into a large storage tank and raised to a large distribution tank it was passed into three subsidiary tanks from which it was piped to the complex citation needed the plinth and tomb took roughly years to complete the remaining parts of the complex took an additional years and were completed in order of minarets mosque and jawab and gateway since the complex was built in stages discrepancies exist in completion dates due to differing opinions on completion construction of the mausoleum itself was essentially completed by while work on the outlying buildings continued for years estimates of the cost of construction vary due to difficulties in estimating costs across time the total cost at the time has been estimated to be about million which is around billion million us based on values due to the global attention that it has received and the millions of visitors it attracts the taj mahal has become a prominent image that is associated with india and in this way has become a symbol of india itself along with being a renowned symbol of love the taj mahal is also a symbol of shah jahan s wealth and power and the fact that the empire had prospered under his rule bilateral symmetry dominated by a central axis has been used by rulers as a symbol of a ruling force that brings balance and harmony and shah jahan applied that concept in the making of the taj mahal additionally the plan is aligned in the cardinal north south direction and the corners have been placed so that when seen from the center of the plan the sun can be seen rising and setting on the north and south corners on the summer and winter solstices respectively this makes the taj a symbolic horizon the planning and structure of the taj mahal from the building itself to the gardens and beyond is symbolic of mumtaz mahal s mansion in the garden of paradise the concept of gardens of paradise is extended into the building of the mausoleum as well colorful vines and flowers decorate the interior and are filled in with semi precious stones using a technique called pietra dura or as the mughals called it parchin kari the building appears to slightly change color depending on the time of day and the weather the sky has not only been incorporated in the design through the reflecting pools but also through the surface of the building itself this is another way to imply the presence of allah at the site according to ebba koch art historian and international expert in the understanding and interpretation of mughal architecture and the taj mahal the planning of the entire compound of the taj symbolizes earthly life and the afterlife a subset of the symbolization of the divine the plan has been split into two one half is the white marble mausoleum itself and the gardens and the other half is the red sandstone side meant for worldly markets only the mausoleum is white so as to represent the enlightenment spirituality and faith of mumtaz mahal according to the world traveler eleanor roosevelt the white symbolized the purity of real love koch has deciphered that symbolic of islamic teachings the plan of the worldly side is a mirror image of the otherworldly side and the grand gate in the middle represents the transition between the two lives the taj is also seen as a feminine architectural form and is thought to embody mumtaz mahal herself soon after the taj mahal s completion shah jahan was deposed by his son aurangzeb and put under house arrest at nearby agra fort upon shah jahan s death aurangzeb buried him in the mausoleum next to his wife in the th century the jat rulers of bharatpur invaded agra and attacked the taj mahal they took away the two chandeliers one of agate and another of silver which were hung over the main cenotaph they also took the gold and silver screen kanbo a mughal historian said the gold shield which covered the metre high ft finial at the top of the main dome was also removed during the jat despoliation by the late th century parts of the buildings had fallen into disrepair at the end of the th century british viceroy lord curzon ordered a sweeping restoration project which was completed in he also commissioned the large lamp in the interior chamber modelled after one in a cairo mosque during this time the garden was remodelled with european style lawns that are still in place today citation needed in the government erected scaffolding to disguise the building in anticipation of air attacks by the japanese air force during the india pakistan wars of and scaffolding was again erected to mislead bomber pilots more recent threats have come from environmental pollution on the banks of the yamuna river including acid rain due to the mathura oil refinery which was opposed by supreme court of india directives citation needed the pollution has been turning the taj mahal yellow brown to help control the pollution the indian government has set up the taj trapezium zone ttz a square kilometre sq mi area around the monument where strict emissions standards are in place concerns for the tomb s structural integrity have recently been raised because of a decline in the groundwater level in the yamuna river basin which is falling at a rate of around m ft per year in cracks appeared in parts of the tomb and the minarets which surround the monument were showing signs of tilting as the wooden foundation of the tomb may be rotting due to lack of water it has been pointed out by politicians however that the minarets are designed to tilt slightly outwards to prevent them from crashing on top of the tomb in the event of an earthquake in it was reported that some predictions indicated that the tomb could collapse within five years small minarets located at two of the outlying buildings were reported as damaged by a storm on april on may another fierce thunderstorm caused some damage to the complex the taj mahal attracts a large number of tourists unesco documented more than million visitors in which had increased to about million in a two tier pricing system is in place with a significantly lower entrance fee for indian citizens and a more expensive one for foreigners as of update the fee for indian citizens was for citizens of saarc and bimstec countries for foreign tourists most tourists visit in the cooler months of october november and february polluting traffic is not allowed near the complex and tourists must either walk from parking areas or catch an electric bus the khawasspuras northern courtyards are currently being restored for use as a new visitor centre in in order to address overtourism the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three hours the small town to the south of the taj known as taj ganji or mumtazabad was initially constructed with caravanserais bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers lists of recommended travel destinations often feature the taj mahal which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern world including the recently announced new seven wonders of the world a recent poll with million votes the grounds are open from to weekdays except for friday when the complex is open for prayers at the mosque between and the complex is open for night viewing on the day of the full moon and two days before and after excluding fridays and the month of ramadan foreign dignitaries often visit the taj mahal on trips to india notable figures who have travelled to the site include dwight eisenhower jacqueline kennedy jimmy carter george h w bush george harrison vladimir putin princess diana donald trump justin trudeau prince charles queen elizabeth and prince philip ever since its construction the building has been the source of an admiration transcending culture and geography and so personal and emotional responses have consistently eclipsed scholastic appraisals of the monument a longstanding myth holds that shah jahan planned a mausoleum to be built in black marble as a black taj mahal across the yamuna river the idea originates from fanciful writings of jean baptiste tavernier a european traveller who visited agra in it was suggested that his son aurangzeb overthrew shah jahan before it could be built ruins of blackened marble across the river in the mehtab bagh seemed to support this legend however excavations carried out in the s found that they were discoloured white stones that had turned black a more credible theory for the origins of the black mausoleum was demonstrated in by archaeologists who reconstructed part of the pool in the mehtab bagh a dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen befitting shah jahan s obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself warrior empire the mughals of india a e television network no concrete evidence exists for claims that describe often in horrific detail the deaths dismemberments and mutilations which shah jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb some stories claim that those involved in construction signed contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design similar claims are made for many famous buildings no evidence exists for claims that lord william bentinck governor general of india in the s supposedly planned to demolish the taj mahal and auction off the marble bentinck s biographer john rosselli says that the story arose from bentinck s fund raising sale of discarded marble from agra fort another myth suggests that beating the silhouette of the finial will cause water to come forth to this day officials find broken bangles surrounding the silhouette several myths none of which are supported by the archaeological record have appeared asserting that people other than shah jahan and the original architects were responsible for the construction of the taj mahal for instance in india s supreme court dismissed p n oak s petition to declare that a hindu king built the taj mahal in a similar petition was dismissed by the allahabad high court this case was brought by amar nath mishra a social worker and preacher who claimed that the taj mahal was built by the hindu king parmal dev in another such unsupported theory is that the taj mahal was designed by an italian geronimo vereneo held sway for a brief period after it was first promoted by henry george keene in who went by a translation of a spanish work itinerario the travels of fray sebastian manrique another theory that a frenchman austin of bordeaux designed the taj was promoted by william henry sleeman based on the work of jean baptiste tavernier these ideas were revived by father hosten and discussed again by e b havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies as of several court cases about taj mahal being a hindu temple have been inspired by p n oak s theory in august archaeological survey of india asi stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple bharatiya janata party s vinay katiyar in claimed that the th century monument was built by mughal emperor shah jahan after destroying a hindu temple called tejo mahalaya and it housed a shiva linga this claim had also been made by another bjp member laxmikant bajpai in the bjp government s union minister of culture mahesh sharma stated in november during a session of the parliament that there was no evidence that it was a temple the theories about taj mahal being a shiva temple started circulating when oak released his book taj mahal the true story he claimed it was built in ad and not in the th century as stated by the asi a controversy was created in when the uttar pradesh government did not include it in its official tourism booklet uttar pradesh tourism unlimited possibilities the chief minister yogi adityanath had earlier claimed it does not represent indian culture amidst this controversy bjp mla sangeet som had claimed that those who built the taj mahal were traitors and it was a blot on the country s culture he claimed it was built by a man who jailed his own father and wished to kill hindus bjp mp anshul verma supported his comments aimim mp asaduddin owaisi jammu kashmir national conference leader omar abdullah and azam khan criticised him cm adityanath stated som s comments were personal and the government will focus on the tourism potential of every monument eastern view in the morning taj mahal in cloudy weather and its minaret under restoration western view at sunset taj mahal through the fog a panoramic view

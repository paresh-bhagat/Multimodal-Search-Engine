the acropolis of athens is an ancient citadel located on a rocky outcrop above the city of athens and contains the remains of several ancient buildings of great architectural and historical significance the most famous being the parthenon the word acropolis is from the greek words akron highest point extremity and polis city the term acropolis is generic and there are many other acropoleis in greece during ancient times the acropolis of athens was known also more properly as cecropia after the legendary serpent man cecrops the supposed first athenian king while there is evidence that the hill was inhabited as far back as the fourth millennium bc it was pericles c bc in the fifth century bc who coordinated the construction of the buildings whose present remains are the site s most important ones including the parthenon the propylaea the erechtheion and the temple of athena nike the parthenon and the other buildings were seriously damaged during the siege by the venetians during the morean war when gunpowder being stored in the parthenon was hit by a venetian bombardment and exploded the acropolis is located on a flattish topped rock that rises m ft above sea level in the city of athens with a surface area of about hectares acres while the earliest artifacts date to the middle neolithic era there have been documented habitations in attica from the early neolithic period th millennium bc there is little doubt that a mycenaean megaron palace stood upon the hill during the late bronze age nothing of this megaron survives except probably a single limestone column base and pieces of several sandstone steps soon after the palace was constructed a cyclopean massive circuit wall was built meters long up to meters high and ranging from to meters thick from the end of the helladic iiib bc on this wall would serve as the main defense for the acropolis until the th century the wall consisted of two parapets built with large stone blocks and cemented with an earth mortar called emplekton greek the wall uses typical mycenaean conventions in that it followed the natural contour of the terrain and its gate which was towards the south was arranged obliquely with a parapet and tower overhanging the incomers right hand side thus facilitating defense there were two lesser approaches up the hill on its north side consisting of steep narrow flights of steps cut in the rock homer is assumed to refer to this fortification when he mentions the strong built house of erechtheus odyssey at some time before the th century bc an earthquake caused a fissure near the northeastern edge of the acropolis this fissure extended some meters to a bed of soft marl in which a well was dug an elaborate set of stairs was built and the well served as an invaluable protected source of drinking water during times of siege for some portion of the mycenaean period not much is known about the architectural appearance of the acropolis until the archaic era during the th and the th centuries bc the site was controlled by kylon during the failed kylonian revolt and twice by peisistratos each of these were attempts directed at seizing political power by coups d tat apart from the hekatompedon mentioned later peisistratos also built an entry gate or propylaea nevertheless it seems that a nine gate wall the enneapylon had been built around the acropolis hill and incorporating the biggest water spring the clepsydra at the northwestern foot a temple to athena polias the tutelary deity of the city was erected between and bc this doric limestone building from which many relics survive is referred to as the hekatompedon greek for hundred footed ur parthenon german for original parthenon or primitive parthenon h architecture or bluebeard temple after the pedimental three bodied man serpent sculpture whose beards were painted dark blue whether this temple replaced an older one or just a sacred precinct or altar is not known probably the hekatompedon was built where the parthenon now stands between and bc yet another temple was built by the pisistratids the old temple of athena usually referred to as the arkhaios ne s ancient temple this temple of athena polias was built upon the d rpfeld foundations between the erechtheion and the still standing parthenon arkhaios ne s was destroyed as part of the achaemenid destruction of athens during the second persian invasion of greece during bc however the temple was probably reconstructed during bc since the treasury of the delian league was transferred in its opisthodomos the temple may have been burnt down during bc as xenophon mentions that the old temple of athena was set afire pausanias does not mention it in his nd century ad description of greece around bc the hekatompedon was dismantled to make place for a new grander building the older parthenon often referred to as the pre parthenon early parthenon for this reason athenians decided to stop the construction of the olympieion temple which was connoted with the tyrant peisistratos and his sons and instead used the piraeus limestone destined for the olympieion to build the older parthenon in order to accommodate the new temple the south part of the summit was cleared made level by adding some two ton blocks of limestone a foundation m ft deep at some points and the rest was filled with soil kept in place by the retaining wall however after the victorious battle of marathon in bc the plan was revised and marble was used instead the limestone phase of the building is referred to as pre parthenon i and the marble phase as pre parthenon ii in bc construction stalled to save resources as xerxes became king of persia and war seemed imminent the older parthenon was still under construction when the persians invaded and sacked the city in bc the building was burned and looted along with the ancient temple and practically everything else on the rock after the persian crisis had subsided the athenians incorporated many architectural parts of the unfinished temple unfluted column drums triglyphs metopes etc into the newly built northern curtain wall of the acropolis where they served as a prominent war memorial and can still be seen today the devastated site was cleared of debris statuary cult objects religious offerings and unsalvageable architectural members were buried ceremoniously in several deeply dug pits on the hill serving conveniently as a fill for the artificial plateau created around the classic parthenon this persian debris was the richest archaeological deposit excavated on the acropolis by after winning at eurymedon during bc cimon and themistocles ordered the reconstruction of the southern and northern walls of the acropolis most of the major temples including the parthenon were rebuilt by order of pericles during the so called golden age of athens bc phidias an athenian sculptor and ictinus and callicrates two famous architects were responsible for the reconstruction during bc mnesicles started building the propylaea a monumental gate at the western end of the acropolis with doric columns of pentelic marble built partly upon the old propylaea of peisistratos these colonnades were almost finished during bc and had two wings the northern one decorated with paintings by polygnotus about the same time south of the propylaea building started on the small ionic temple of athena nike in pentelic marble with tetrastyle porches preserving the essentials of greek temple design after an interruption caused by the peloponnesian war the temple was finished during the time of nicias peace between bc and bc construction of the elegant temple of erechtheion in pentelic marble bc was by a complex plan which took account of the extremely uneven ground and the need to circumvent several shrines in the area the entrance facing east is lined with six ionic columns unusually the temple has two porches one on the northwest corner borne by ionic columns the other to the southwest supported by huge female figures or caryatids the eastern part of the temple was dedicated to athena polias while the western part serving the cult of the archaic king poseidon erechtheus housed the altars of hephaestus and voutos brother of erechtheus little is known about the original plan of the interior which was destroyed by fire during the first century bc and has been rebuilt several times during the same period a combination of sacred precincts including the temples of athena polias poseidon erechtheus cecrops herse pandrosos and aglauros with its kore porch porch of the maidens or caryatids balcony was begun between the temple of athena nike and the parthenon there was the sanctuary of artemis brauronia or the brauroneion the goddess represented as a bear and worshipped in the deme of brauron according to pausanias a wooden statue or xoanon of the goddess and a statue of artemis made by praxiteles during the th century bc were both in the sanctuary behind the propylaea phidias gigantic bronze statue of athena promachos athena who fights in the front line built between bc and bc dominated the base was m ft in high while the total height of the statue was m ft the goddess held a lance the gilt tip of which could be seen as a reflection by crews on ships rounding cape sounion and a giant shield on the left side decorated by mys with images of the fight between the centaurs and the lapiths other monuments that have left almost nothing visible to the present day are the chalkotheke the pandroseion pandion s sanctuary athena s altar zeus polieus s sanctuary and from roman times the circular temple of augustus and rome during the hellenistic and roman periods many of the existing buildings in the area of the acropolis were repaired due to damage from age and occasionally war monuments to foreign kings were erected notably those of the attalid kings of pergamon attalos ii in front of the nw corner of the parthenon and eumenes ii in front of the propylaia these were rededicated during the early roman empire to augustus or claudius uncertain and agrippa respectively eumenes was also responsible for constructing a stoa on the south slope not unlike that of attalos in the agora below during the julio claudian period the temple of rome and augustus a small round edifice about meters from the parthenon was to be the last significant ancient construction on the summit of the rock around the same time on the north slope in a cave next to the one dedicated to pan since the classical period a sanctuary was founded where the archons dedicated to apollo on assuming office during ad on the south slope the roman herodes atticus built his grand amphitheater or odeon it was destroyed by the invading herulians a century later but was reconstructed during the s during the rd century under threat from a herulian invasion repairs were made to the acropolis walls and the beul gate was constructed to restrict entrance in front of the propylaia thus returning the acropolis to use as a fortress during the byzantine period the parthenon was used as a church dedicated to the virgin mary during the latin duchy of athens the acropolis functioned as the city s administrative center with the parthenon as its cathedral and the propylaea as part of the ducal palace a large tower was added the frankopyrgos demolished during the th century after the ottoman conquest of greece the parthenon was used as the garrison headquarters of the turkish army and the erechtheum was turned into the governor s private harem the buildings of the acropolis suffered significant damage during the siege by the venetians in the morean war the parthenon which was being used as a gunpowder magazine was hit by artillery shot and damaged severely during subsequent years the acropolis was a site of bustling human activity with many byzantine frankish and ottoman structures the dominant feature during the ottoman period was a mosque inside the parthenon complete with a minaret the acropolis was besieged thrice during the greek war of independence two sieges from the greeks in and one from the ottomans in a new bulwark named after odysseas androutsos was built by the greeks between and to protect the recently rediscovered klepsydra spring which became the sole fresh water supply of the fortress after independence most features that dated from the byzantine frankish and ottoman periods were cleared from the site in an attempt to restore the monument to its original form cleansed of all later additions german neoclassicist architect leo von klenze was responsible for the restoration of the acropolis in the th century according to german historian wolf seidl as described in his book bavarians in greece at the beginning of the axis occupation of greece in german soldiers raised the nazi german war flag over the acropolis it would be taken down by manolis glezos and apostolos santas in one of the first acts of resistance in greek prime minister georgios papandreou arrived on the acropolis to celebrate liberation from the nazis the entrance to the acropolis was a monumental gateway termed the propylaea to the south of the entrance is the tiny temple of athena nike at the centre of the acropolis is the parthenon or temple of athena parthenos athena the virgin east of the entrance and north of the parthenon is the temple known as the erechtheum south of the platform that forms the top of the acropolis there are also the remains of the ancient though often remodelled theatre of dionysus a few hundred metres away there is the now partially reconstructed odeon of herodes atticus all the valuable ancient artifacts are situated in the acropolis museum which resides on the southern slope of the same rock metres from the parthenon site plan of the acropolis at athens showing the major archaeological remains the acropolis restoration project began in with the goal to reverse the decay of centuries of attrition pollution destruction from military actions and misguided past restorations the project included collection and identification of all stone fragments even small ones from the acropolis and its slopes and the attempt was made to restore as much as possible using reassembled original material anastylosis with new marble from mount pentelicus used sparingly all restoration was made using titanium dowels and is designed to be completely reversible in case future experts decide to change things a combination of cutting edge modern technology and extensive research and reinvention of ancient techniques were used the parthenon colonnades largely destroyed by venetian bombardment during the th century were restored with many wrongly assembled columns now properly placed the roof and floor of the propylaea were partly restored with sections of the roof made of new marble and decorated with blue and gold inserts as in the original restoration of the temple of athena nike was completed in a total of tons of architectural members were restored with stones reassembled from fragments of the originals patched with new marble and parts made entirely of new marble a total of cubic meters of new pentelic marble were used in the addition of new reinforced concrete paths to the site to improve accessibility caused controversy among archaeologists every four years the athenians had a festival called the great panathenaea that rivaled the olympic games in popularity during the festival a procession believed to be depicted on the parthenon frieze traveled through the city via the panathenaic way and culminated on the acropolis there a new robe of woven wool peplos was placed on either the statue of athena polias in the erechtheum during the annual lesser panathenaea or the statue of athena parthenos in the parthenon during the great panathenaea held every four years within the later tradition of western civilization and classical revival the acropolis from at least the mid th century on has often been invoked as a critical symbol of the greek legacy and of the glories of classical greece most of the artifacts from the temple are housed today in the acropolis museum at the foot of the ancient rock the acropolis is a klippe consisting of two lithostratigraphic units the athens schist and the overlying acropolis limestone the athens schist is a soft reddish rock dating from the upper cretaceous period the original sediments were deposited in a river delta approximately million years ago the acropolis limestone dates from the upper jurassic period predating the underlying athens schist by about million years the acropolis limestone was thrust over the athens schist by compressional tectonic forces plate tectonics forming a nappe or overthrust sheet erosion of the limestone nappe led to the eventual detachment of the acropolis forming the present day feature where the athens schist and the limestone meet there are springs and karstic caves many of the hills in the athens region were formed by the erosion of the same nappe as the acropolis these include the hills of lykabettos areopagus and mouseion the marble utilized to construct the buildings of the acropolis was sourced from the quarries of mount pentelicus a mountain to the northeast of the city the limestone that the acropolis is built upon is unstable because of the erosion and tectonic shifts that the region is prone to this instability can cause rock slides that cause damage to the historic site various measures have been implemented to protect the site including retaining walls drainage systems and rock bolts these measures work to counter the natural processes that threaten the historic site marble seats at the theatre of dionysus inscribed with names pergamene column at the stoa of eumenes choragic monument of thrasyllos temple of asclepius north portico of the erechtheion where a coffer is missing signifying the supposed place where zeus struck his lightning bolt killing erechtheus another belief is that this was believed to be the location where poseidon struck his trident into the acropolis hill notes bibliography videos

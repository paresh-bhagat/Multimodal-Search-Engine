john f kennedy international airport as a tribute to the th president of the united states john f kennedy international airport was originally called idlewild airport iata idl icao kidl faa lid idl after the idlewild beach golf course that it displaced it was built to relieve laguardia field which had become overcrowded after its opening in late mayor fiorello la guardia announced that the city had tentatively chosen a large area of marshland on jamaica bay which included the idlewild golf course as well as a summer hotel and a landing strip called the jamaica sea airport for a new airfield title to the land was conveyed to the city at the end of december construction began in though the airport s final layout was not yet decided upon about us million was initially spent with governmental funding but only acres ha of the idlewild golf course site were earmarked for use the project was renamed major general alexander e anderson airport in after a queens resident who had commanded a federalized national guard unit in the southern united states and died in late the renaming was vetoed by mayor la guardia and reinstated by the new york city council in common usage the airport was still called idlewild in the new york city board of estimate authorized the condemnation of another acres ha for idlewild the port of new york authority now the port authority of new york and new jersey leased the idlewild property from the city of new york in and maintains this lease today in march the city council changed the official name to new york international airport anderson field but the common name remained idlewild until december the airport was intended as the world s largest and most efficient with no confusion and no congestion the first flight from idlewild was on july with the opening ceremony attended by then u s president harry s truman the port authority canceled foreign airlines permits to use laguardia forcing them to move to idlewild during the next couple of years idlewild at the time had a single square foot m terminal building by the terminal building was being expanded to square feet m further expansions would come in following years including a control tower in as well as new and expanded buildings and taxiways idlewild opened with six runways and a seventh under construction runways l and l were held in reserve and never came into use as runways runway r originally ft or m is still in use runway l originally ft or m opened soon after the rest of the airport and is still in use runway r closed in and runway r closed around runway originally ft now runway l opened june and runway r was added ten years later a smaller runway was built after runway r closed and was used until by general aviation stol and smaller commuter flights the avro jetliner was the first jet airliner to land at idlewild on april a sud aviation caravelle prototype was the next jet airliner to land at idlewild on may later in the ussr sought approval for two jet powered tupolev tu flights carrying diplomats to idlewild the port authority did not allow them saying noise tests had to be done first the caravelle had been tested at paris in the airport averaged daily airline operations takeoffs plus landings the october airline guide shows nine domestic departures a day on national and northwest much of newark s traffic moved to idlewild which averaged daily airline operations in when newark closed in february l constellations and dc s appeared between and and did not use laguardia for their first several years bringing more traffic to idlewild the april airline guide cites a total of departures a week including about from eastern air lines from national airlines and from pan american full citation needed by idlewild had the highest volume of international air traffic of any airport globally the port of new york authority originally planned a single gate terminal but the major airlines did not agree with this plan arguing that the terminal would be far too small for future traffic architect wallace harrison then designed a plan for each major airline at the airport to be given its own space to develop its own terminal this scheme made construction more practical made terminals more navigable and introduced incentives for airlines to compete with each other for the best design the revised plan met airline approval in with seven terminals initially planned five terminals were for individual airlines one was for three airlines and one was for international arrivals national airlines and british airways arrived later in addition there would be an story control tower roadways parking lots taxiways and a reflecting lagoon in the center the airport was designed for aircraft up to pound kg gross weight the airport had to be modified in the late s to accommodate the boeing s weight the international arrivals building or iab was the first new terminal at the airport opening in december the building was designed by skidmore owings and merrill som the terminal stretched nearly feet meters and was parallel to runway r the terminal had finger piers at right angles to the main building allowing more aircraft to park an innovation at the time the building was expanded in to accommodate jetways however by the s the overcrowded building was showing its age and it did not provide adequate space for security checkpoints it was demolished in and replaced with terminal united airlines and delta air lines opened terminal later renumbered terminal a som design similar to the iab in october it was demolished in eastern airlines opened their chester l churchill designed terminal in november the terminal was demolished in and replaced with the current terminal american airlines opened terminal in february it was designed by kahn and jacobs and had a foot m stained glass facade designed by robert sowers the largest stained glass installation in the world until the facade was removed in as the

passenger loading area it was one of the first airline terminals in the world to feature jetways that connected to the terminal and that could be moved to provide an easy walkway for passengers from the terminal to a docked aircraft jetways replaced the need to have to board the plane outside via airstairs which descend from an aircraft truck mounted mobile stairs or wheeled stairs the worldport was demolished in trans world airlines opened the twa flight center in designed by eero saarinen with a distinctive winged bird shape with the demise of twa in the terminal remained vacant until when jetblue and the port authority of new york and new jersey panynj financed the construction of a new gate terminal partly encircling the saarinen building called terminal now t the new terminal opened

having suspended its ultra long haul singapore newark route singapore airlines now uses the airbus a ulr and keeps the singapore jfk route despite reinstating the newark route the original non stop singapore new york flight in march therefore singapore airlines operates both non stop and one stop flights to new york jfk the latter being an airbus a flight stopping at frankfurt along with non

harry reid international airport which serves the las vegas metropolitan area until the early s each terminal was known by the primary airline that served it except for terminal which was known as the international arrivals building in the early s all terminals were given numbers except for the tower air terminal which sat outside the central terminals area and was not numbered like the other airports controlled by the port authority jfk s terminals are sometimes managed and maintained by independent terminal operators at jfk all terminals are managed by airlines or consortiums of the airlines serving them except for the schiphol group operated terminal all terminals except terminal can handle international arrivals that are not pre cleared most inter terminal connections require

partnership between munich airport group lufthansa air france korean air and japan airlines of these gates all are international gates are widebody gates can accommodate an airbus a and is a narrowbody gate this would also require reconfiguring new roads to accommodate the new terminal on december new york governor kathy hochul gave a further update on the plans to build a new terminal

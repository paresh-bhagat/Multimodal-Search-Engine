 the great pyramid of giza a is the biggest egyptian pyramid and the tomb of fourth dynasty pharaoh khufu built in the early th century bc during a period of around years the pyramid is the oldest of the seven wonders of the ancient world and the only one to remain largely intact as part of the giza pyramid complex it borders present day giza in greater cairo egypt initially standing at metres feet the great pyramid was the tallest man made structure in the world for more than years over time most of the smooth white limestone casing was removed which lowered the pyramid s height to the present metres ft what is seen today is the underlying core structure the base was measured to be about metres ft square giving a volume of roughly million cubic metres million cubic feet which includes an internal hillock the dimensions of the pyramid were royal cubits m ft high a base length of cubits m ft with a seked of palms a slope of the great pyramid was built by quarrying an estimated million large blocks weighing million tonnes in total the majority of stones are not uniform in size or shape and are only roughly dressed the outside layers were bound together by mortar primarily local limestone from the giza plateau was used other blocks were imported by boat down the nile white limestone from tura for the casing and granite blocks from aswan weighing up to tonnes for the king s chamber structure there are three known chambers inside the great pyramid the lowest was cut into the bedrock upon which the pyramid was built but remained unfinished the so called queen s chamber and king s chamber that contains a granite sarcophagus are higher up within the pyramid structure khufu s vizier hemiunu also called hemon is believed by some to be the architect of the great pyramid many varying scientific and alternative hypotheses attempt to explain the exact construction techniques the funerary complex around the pyramid consisted of two mortuary temples connected by a causeway one close to the pyramid and one near the nile tombs for the immediate family and court of khufu including three smaller pyramids for khufu s wives an even smaller satellite pyramid and five buried solar barges historically the great pyramid had been attributed to khufu based on the words of authors of classical antiquity first and foremost herodotus and diodorus siculus however during the middle ages a number of other people were credited with the construction of the pyramid as well for example joseph nimrod or king saurid in four additional relieving chambers were found above the king s chamber after tunneling to them the chambers previously inaccessible were covered in hieroglyphs of red paint the workers who were building the pyramid had marked the blocks with the names of their gangs which included the pharaoh s name e g the gang the white crown of khnum khufu is powerful the names of khufu were spelled out on the walls over a dozen times another of these graffiti was found by goyon on an exterior block of the th layer of the pyramid the inscriptions are comparable to those found at other sites of khufu such as the alabaster quarry at hatnub or the harbor at wadi al jarf and are present in pyramids of other pharaohs as well throughout the th century the cemeteries next to the pyramid were excavated family members and high officials of khufu were buried in the east field south of the causeway and the west field most notably the wives children and grandchildren of khufu hemiunu ankhaf and the funerary cache of hetepheres i mother of khufu as hassan puts it from the early dynastic times it was always the custom for the relatives friends and courtiers to be buried in the vicinity of the king they had served during life this was quite in accordance with the egyptian idea of the hereafter the cemeteries were actively expanded until the th dynasty and used less frequently afterwards the earliest pharaonic name of seal impressions is that of khufu the latest of pepi ii worker graffiti was written on some of the stones of the tombs as well for instance mddw horus name of khufu on the mastaba of chufunacht probably a grandson of khufu some inscriptions in the chapels of the mastabas like the pyramid their burial chambers were usually bare of inscriptions mention khufu or his pyramid for instance an inscription of mersyankh iii states that her mother is the daughter of the king of upper and lower egypt khufu most often these references are part of a title for example snnw ka chief of the settlement and overseer of the pyramid city of akhet khufu or merib priest of khufu several tomb owners have a king s name as part of their own name e g chufudjedef chufuseneb merichufu the earliest pharaoh alluded to in that manner at giza is snefru khufu s father in hassan uncovered a stela of amenhotep ii near the great sphinx of giza which implies the two larger pyramids were still attributed to khufu and khafre in the new kingdom it reads he yoked the horses in memphis when he was still young and stopped at the sanctuary of hor em akhet the sphinx he spent a time there in going round it looking at the beauty of the sanctuary of khufu and khafra the revered in two boat pits one containing the khufu ship were discovered buried at the south foot of the pyramid the cartouche of djedefre was found on many of the blocks that covered the boat pits as the successor and eldest son he would have presumably been responsible for the burial of khufu the second boat pit was examined in excavation work started in graffiti on the stones included instances of the name khufu instances of djedefre a year in reign season month and day measurements of the stone various signs and marks and a reference line used in construction all done in red or black ink during excavations in the diary of merer was found at wadi al jarf it documents the transportation of white limestone blocks from tura to the great pyramid which is mentioned by its original name akhet khufu with a pyramid determinative dozens of times it details that the stones were accepted at she akhet khufu the pool of the pyramid horizon of khufu and ro she khufu the entrance to the pool of khufu which were under supervision of ankhhaf half brother and vizier of khufu as well as owner of the largest mastaba of the giza east field the great pyramid has been determined to be about years old by two principal approaches indirectly through its attribution to khufu and his chronological age based on archaeological and textual evidence and directly via radiocarbon dating of organic material found in the pyramid and included in its mortar in the past the great pyramid was dated by its attribution to khufu alone putting the construction of the great pyramid within his reign hence dating the pyramid was a matter of dating khufu and the th dynasty the relative sequence and synchronicity of events stands at the focal point of this method absolute calendar dates are derived from an interlocked network of evidence the backbone of which are the lines of succession known from ancient king lists and other texts the reign lengths from khufu to known points in the earlier past are summated bolstered with genealogical data astronomical observations and other sources as such the historical chronology of egypt is primarily a political chronology thus independent from other types of archaeological evidence like stratigraphies material culture or radiocarbon dating the majority of recent chronological estimates date khufu and his pyramid roughly between and bc mortar was used generously in the great pyramid s construction in the mixing process ashes from fires were added to the mortar organic material that could be extracted and radiocarbon dated a total of samples of the mortar were taken in and making sure they were clearly inherent to the original structure and could not have been incorporated at a later date the results were calibrated to bc the old wood problem is thought to be mainly responsible for the year offset since the age of the organic material was determined not when it was last used a reanalysis of the data gave a completion date for the pyramid between and bc based on the younger samples in waynman dixon opened the lower pair of air shafts previously closed at both ends by chiseling holes into the walls of the queen s chamber one of the objects found within was a cedar plank which came into possession of james grant a friend of dixon after inheritance it was donated to the museum of aberdeen in however it had broken into pieces and was filed incorrectly lost in the vast museum collection it was only rediscovered in when it was radiocarbon dated to bc being over years older than khufu s chronological age abeer eladany suggests that the wood originated from the center of a long lived tree or had been recycled for many years prior to being deposited in the pyramid circa bc herodotus attributed the great pyramid to cheops hellenization of khufu yet erroneously placed his reign following the ramesside period manetho around years later composed an extensive list of egyptian kings which he divided into dynasties assigning khufu to the th however after phonetic changes in the egyptian language and consequently the greek translation cheops had transformed into souphis and similar versions greaves in reported the great difficulty of ascertaining a date for the pyramid s construction based on the lacking and conflicting historic sources because of the aforementioned differences in spelling he didn t recognize khufu on manetho s king list as transcribed by africanus and eusebius hence he relied on herodotus incorrect account summating the duration of lines of succession greaves concluded the year bc to be the beginning of khufu s reign two centuries later some of the gaps and uncertainties in manetho s chronology had been cleared by discoveries such as the king lists of turin abydos and karnak the names of khufu found within the great pyramid s relieving chambers in helped to make clear that cheops and souphis are in fact one and the same thus the great pyramid was recognized to have been built in the th dynasty the dating among egyptologists still varied by multiple centuries around bc depending on methodology preconceived religious notions such as the biblical deluge and which source they thought was more credible estimates significantly narrowed in the th century most being within years of each other around the middle of the third millennium bc the newly developed radiocarbon dating method confirmed that the historic chronology was approximately correct it is however still not a fully appreciated method due to larger margins or error calibration uncertainties and the problem of inbuilt age time between growth and final usage in plant material including wood furthermore astronomical alignments have been suggested to coincide with the time of construction egyptian chronology continues to be refined and data from multiple disciplines have started to be factored in such as luminescence dating radiocarbon dating and dendrochronology for instance ramsey et al included over radiocarbon samples in their model the ancient greek historian herodotus writing in the th century bc is one of the first major authors to mention the pyramid in the second book of his work the histories he discusses the history of egypt and the great pyramid this report was created more than years after the structure was built meaning that herodotus obtained his knowledge mainly from a variety of indirect sources including officials and priests of low rank local egyptians greek immigrants and herodotus s own interpreters accordingly his explanations present themselves as a mixture of comprehensible descriptions personal descriptions erroneous reports and fantastical legends as such many of the speculative errors and confusions about the monument can be traced back to herodotus and his work herodotus writes that the great pyramid was built by khufu hellenized as cheops who he erroneously relays ruled after the ramesside period the th dynasty and the th dynasty khufu was a tyrannical king herodotus claims which may explain the greek s view that such buildings can only come about through cruel exploitation of the people herodotus further states that gangs of labourers worked on the building in three month shifts taking years to build in the first ten years a wide causeway was erected which according to herodotus was almost as impressive as the construction of the pyramids themselves it measured nearly kilometre mi long and yards m wide and elevated to a height of yards m consisting of stone polished and carved with figures in addition underground chambers were made on the hill whereon the pyramids stand these were intended to be burial places for khufu himself and were encompassed with water by a channel brought in from the nile herodotus later states that at the pyramid of khafre located beside the great pyramid the nile flows through a built passage to an island in which khufu is buried hawass interprets this to be a reference to the osiris shaft which is located at the causeway of khafre south of the great pyramid herodotus also described an inscription on the outside of the pyramid which according to his translators indicated the amount of radishes garlic and onions that the workers would have eaten while working on the pyramid this could be a note of restoration work that khaemweset son of rameses ii had carried out apparently herodotus companions and interpreters could not read the hieroglyphs or deliberately gave him false information between and bc the ancient greek historian diodorus siculus visited egypt and later dedicated the first book of his bibliotheca historica to the land its history and its monuments including the great pyramid diodorus s work was inspired by historians of the past but he also distanced himself from herodotus who diodorus claims tells marvelous tales and myths diodorus presumably drew his knowledge from the lost work of hecataeus of abdera and like herodotus he also places the builder of the pyramid chemmis after ramses iii according to his report neither chemmis khufu nor cephren khafre were buried in their pyramids but rather in secret places for fear that the people ostensibly forced to build the structures would seek out the bodies for revenge with this assertion diodorus strengthened the connection between pyramid building and slavery according to diodorus the cladding of the pyramid was still in excellent condition at the time whereas the uppermost part of the pyramid was formed by a platform cubits m ft high about the construction of the pyramid he notes that it was built with the help of ramps since no lifting tools had yet been invented nothing was left of the ramps as they were removed after the pyramids were completed he estimated the number of workers necessary to erect the great pyramid at and the construction time at years similar to herodotus diodorus also claims that the side of the pyramid is inscribed with writing that set forth the price of vegetables and purgatives for the workmen there were paid out over sixteen hundred talents the greek geographer philosopher and historian strabo visited egypt around bc shortly after egypt was annexed by the romans in his work geographica he argues that the pyramids were the burial place of kings but he does not mention which king was buried in the structure strabo also mentions at a moderate height in one of the sides is a stone which may be taken out when that is removed there is an oblique passage to the tomb this statement has generated much speculation as it suggests that the pyramid could be entered at this time the roman writer pliny the elder writing in the first century ad argued that the great pyramid had been raised either to prevent the lower classes from remaining unoccupied or as a measure to prevent the pharaoh s riches from falling into the hands of his rivals or successors pliny does not speculate as to the pharaoh in question explicitly noting that accident has consigned to oblivion the names of those who erected such stupendous memorials of their vanity in pondering how the stones could be transported to such a vast height he gives two explanations that either vast mounds of nitre and salt were heaped up against the pyramid which were then melted away with water redirected from the river or that bridges were constructed their bricks afterwards distributed for erecting houses of private individuals arguing that the level of the river is too low for canals to ever bring water up to the pyramid pliny also recounts how in the interior of the largest pyramid there is a well eighty six cubits m ft deep which communicates with the river it is thought further he describes a method discovered by thales of miletus for ascertaining the pyramid s height by measuring its shadow during late antiquity a misinterpretation of the pyramids as joseph s granary began to gain in popularity the first textual evidence of this connection is found in the travel narratives of the female christian pilgrim egeria who records that on her visit between and ad in the twelve mile stretch between memphis and babylonia old cairo are many pyramids which joseph made in order to store corn ten years later the usage is confirmed in the anonymous travelogue of seven monks that set out from jerusalem to visit the famous ascetics in egypt wherein they report that they saw joseph s granaries where he stored grain in biblical times this late th century usage is further confirmed in the geographical treatise cosmographia written by julius honorius around ad which explains that the pyramids were called the granaries of joseph horrea ioseph this reference from julius is important as it indicates that the identification was starting to spread out from pilgrim s travelogues in ad stephanos of byzantium added more to this idea when he wrote in his ethnica that the word pyramid was connected to the greek word puros meaning wheat in the seventh century ad the rashidun caliphate conquered egypt ending several centuries of romano byzantine rule a few centuries later in ad the abbasid caliph al ma mun is said to have tunneled into the side of the structure and discovered the ascending passage and its connecting chambers around this time a coptic legend gained popularity that claimed the antediluvian king surid ibn salhouk had built the pyramid one legend in particular relates how three hundred years prior to the great flood surid had a terrifying dream of the world s end and so he ordered the construction of the pyramids so that they might house all the knowledge of egypt and survive into the present the most notable account of this legend was given by al masudi in his akbar al zaman alongside imaginative tales about the pyramid such as the story of a man who fell three hours down the pyramid s well and the tale of an expedition that discovered bizarre finds in the structure s inner chambers al zaman also contains a report of al ma mun s entering the pyramid and discovering a vessel containing a thousand coins which just so happened to account for the cost of opening the pyramid some speculate that this story is true but that the coins were planted by al ma mun to appease his workers who were likely frustrated that they had found no treasure in ad the arab bibliographer ibn al nadim relates a fantastical tale in his al fihrist about a man who journeyed into the main chamber of a pyramid which bayard dodge argues is the great pyramid according to al nadim the person in question saw a statue of a man holding a tablet and a woman holding a mirror supposedly between the statues was a stone vessel with a gold cover inside the vessel was something like pitch and when the explorer reached into the vessel a gold receptacle happened to be inside the receptacle when taken from the vessel was filled with fresh blood which quickly dried up ibn al nadim s work also claims that the bodies of a man and woman were discovered inside the pyramid in the best possible state of preservation the author al kaisi in his work the tohfat alalbab retells the story of al ma mun s entry but with the additional discovery of an image of a man in green stone which when opened revealed a body dressed in jewel encrusted gold armor al kaisi claims to have seen the case from which the body was taken and asserts that it was located at the king s palace in cairo he also writes that he himself entered into the pyramid and discovered myriad preserved bodies the arab polymath abd al latif al baghdadi studied the pyramid with great care and in his account of egypt he praises them as works of engineering genius in addition to measuring the structure alongside the other pyramids at giza al baghdadi also writes that the structures were surely tombs although he thought the great pyramid was used for the burial of agathodaimon or hermes al baghdadi ponders whether the pyramid pre dated the great flood as described in genesis and even briefly entertained the idea that it was a pre adamic construction a few centuries later the islamic historian al maqrizi compiled lore about the great pyramid in his al khitat in addition to reasserting that al ma mun breached the structure in ad al maqrizi s work also discusses the sarcophagus in the coffin chambers explicitly noting that the pyramid was a grave by the late middle ages the great pyramid had gained a reputation as a haunted structure others feared entering because it was home to animals like bats a hillock forms the base on which the pyramids stands it was cut back into steps and only a strip around the perimeter was leveled which has been measured to be horizontal and flat to within millimetres in the bedrock reaches a height of almost metres ft above the pyramid base at the location of the grotto along the sides of the base platform a series of holes are cut in the bedrock lehner hypothesizes that they held wooden posts used for alignment edwards among others suggested the usage of water for evening the base although it is unclear how practical and workable such a system would be the great pyramid consists of an estimated million blocks approximately million tonnes of limestone tonnes of granite and tonnes of mortar were used in the construction most of the blocks were quarried at giza just south of the pyramid an area now known as the central field the white limestone used for the casing originated from tura km mi south of giza and was transported by boat down the nile in rolls of papyrus called the diary of merer were discovered written by a supervisor of the deliveries of limestone and other construction materials from tura to giza in the last known year of khufu s reign the granite stones in the pyramid were transported from aswan more than km mi away the largest weighing to tonnes form the roofs of the king s chamber and the relieving chambers above it ancient egyptians cut stone into rough blocks by hammering grooves into natural stone faces inserting wooden wedges then soaking these with water as the water was absorbed the wedges expanded breaking off workable chunks once the blocks were cut they were carried by boat either up or down the nile river to the pyramid the greeks believed that slave labour was used but modern discoveries made at nearby workers camps associated with construction at giza suggest that it was built instead by thousands of conscript laborers worker graffiti found at giza suggest haulers were divided into zau singular za groups of men consisting of four sub units that each had an overseer of ten as to the question of how over two million blocks could have been cut within khufu s lifetime stonemason franck burgos conducted an archaeological experiment based on an abandoned quarry of khufu discovered in within it an almost completed block and the tools used for cutting it had been uncovered hardened arsenic copper chisels wooden mallets ropes and stone tools in the experiment replicas of these were used to cut a block weighing about tonnes the average block size used for the great pyramid it took four workers days with each working hours a day to excavate it the initially slow progress sped up six times when the stone was wetted with water based on the data burgos extrapolates that about quarry men could have produced the blocks day needed to complete the great pyramid in years a construction management study conducted in in association with mark lehner and other egyptologists had estimated that the total project required an average workforce of about people and a peak workforce of roughly the first precise measurements of the pyramid were made by egyptologist flinders petrie in published as the pyramids and temples of gizeh many of the casing stones and inner chamber blocks of the great pyramid fit together with high precision with joints on average only millimetres in wide on the contrary core blocks were only roughly shaped with rubble inserted between larger gaps mortar was used to bind the outer layers together and fill gaps and joints the block height and weight tends to get progressively smaller towards the top petrie measured the lowest layer to be centimetres ft high whereas the layers towards the summit barely exceed centimetres ft the accuracy of the pyramid s perimeter is such that the four sides of the base have an average error of only millimetres inches in length b and the finished base was squared to a mean corner error of only seconds of arc the completed design dimensions are measured to have originally been royal cubits m ft high by cubits m ft long at each of the four sides of its base ancient egyptians used seked how much run for one cubit of rise to describe slopes for the great pyramid a seked of palms was chosen a ratio of up to in some egyptologists suggest this slope was chosen because the ratio of perimeter to height cubits equals to an accuracy of better than percent corresponding to the well known approximation of as verner wrote we can conclude that although the ancient egyptians could not precisely define the value of in practice they used it petrie concluded but these relations of areas and of circular ratio are so systematic that we should grant that they were in the builder s design others have argued that the ancient egyptians had no concept of pi and would not have thought to encode it in their monuments and that the observed pyramid slope may be based on the seked choice alone the sides of the great pyramid s base are closely aligned to the four geographic not magnetic cardinal directions deviating on average minutes and seconds of arc or about a tenth of a degree several methods have been proposed for how the ancient egyptians achieved this level of accuracy many alternative often contradictory theories have been proposed regarding the pyramid s construction techniques one mystery of the pyramid s construction is its planning john romer suggests that they used the same method that had been used for earlier and later constructions laying out parts of the plan on the ground at a to scale he writes that such a working diagram would also serve to generate the architecture of the pyramid with precision unmatched by any other means the basalt blocks of the pyramid temple show clear evidence of having been cut with some kind of saw with an estimated cutting blade of feet m in length romer suggests that this super saw may have had copper teeth and weighed up to kilograms lb he theorizes that such a saw could have been attached to a wooden trestle support and possibly used in conjunction with vegetable oil cutting sand emery or pounded quartz to cut the blocks which would have required the labour of at least a dozen men to operate it at completion the great pyramid was cased entirely in white limestone precisely worked blocks were placed in horizontal layers and carefully fitted together with mortar their outward faces cut at a slope and smoothed to a high degree together they created four uniform surfaces angled at a seked of palms unfinished casing blocks of the pyramids of menkaure and henutsen at giza suggest that the front faces were smoothed only after the stones were laid with chiseled seams marking correct positioning and where the superfluous rock would have to be trimmed off the height of the horizontal layers is not uniform but varies considerably the highest of the remaining courses are towards the bottom the first layer being the tallest at metres ft towards the top layers tend to be only slightly over royal cubit m ft in height an irregular pattern is noticeable when looking at the sizes in sequence where layer height declines steadily only to rise sharply again so called backing stones supported the casing which were unlike core blocks precisely dressed as well and bound to the casing with mortar nowadays these stones give the structure its visible appearance following the dismantling of the pyramid in the middle ages in ad a massive earthquake had loosened many of the outer casing stones citation needed which were said to have been carted away by bahri sultan an nasir nasir ad din al hasan in for use in nearby cairo many more casing stones were removed from the site by muhammad ali pasha in the early th century to build the upper portion of his alabaster mosque in cairo not far from giza citation needed later explorers reported massive piles of rubble at the base of the pyramids left over from the continuing collapse of the casing stones which were subsequently cleared away during continuing excavations of the site today a few of the casing stones from the lowest course can be seen in situ on each side with the best preserved on the north below the entrances excavated by vyse in the mortar was chemically analyzed and contains organic inclusions mostly charcoal samples of which were radiocarbon dated to bc it has been theorized that the mortar enabled the masons to set the stones exactly by providing a level bed it has been suggested that some or all of the casing stones were cast in place rather than quarried and moved yet archaeological evidence and petrographic analysis indicate this was not the case petrie noted in that the sides of the pyramid as we see them today are very distinctly hollowed and that each side has a sort of groove specially down the middle of the face which he reasoned was a result of increased casing thickness in these areas a laser scanning survey in confirmed the existence of the anomalies which can be to some degree attributed to damaged and removed stones under certain lighting conditions and with image enhancement the faces can appear to be split leading to speculation that the pyramid had been intentionally constructed eight sided the pyramid was once topped by a capstone known as a pyramidion the material it was made from is subject to much speculation limestone granite or basalt are commonly proposed while in popular culture it is often solid gold or gilded all known th dynasty pyramidia of the red pyramid satellite pyramid of khufu g d and queen s pyramid of menkaure g a are of white limestone and were not gilded only from the th dynasty onward is there evidence of gilded capstones for instance a scene on the causeway of the sahure speaks of the white gold pyramidion of the pyramid sahure s soul shines the great pyramid s pyramidion was already lost in antiquity as pliny the elder and later authors report of a platform on its summit nowadays the pyramid is about metres ft shorter than it was when intact with about tonnes of material missing from the top in a mast was installed on the top by the scottish astronomer sir david gill who whilst returning from work involving observing a rare venus transit was invited to survey egypt and began by surveying the great pyramid his results measuring the pyramid were accurate to within mm and the survey mast is still in place to this day the internal structure consists of three main chambers the king s queen s and subterranean chamber the grand gallery and various corridors and shafts there are two entrances into the pyramid the original and a forced passage which meet at a junction from there one passage descends into the subterranean chamber while the other ascends to the grand gallery from the beginning of the gallery three paths can be taken both the king s and queen s chamber have a pair of small air shafts above the king s chamber are a series of five relieving chambers the original entrance is located on the north side royal cubits m ft east of the centerline of the pyramid before the removal of the casing in the middle ages the pyramid was entered through a hole in the th layer of masonry approximately metres ft above the pyramid s base level the height of that layer centimetres ft corresponds to the size of the entrance tunnel which is commonly called the descending passage according to strabo bc a movable stone could be raised to enter this sloping corridor however it is not known if it was a later addition or original a row of double chevrons diverts weight away from the entrance several of these chevron blocks are now missing as the slanted faces they used to rest on indicate numerous mostly modern graffiti is cut into the stones around the entrance most notable is a large square text of hieroglyphs carved in honor of frederick william iv by karl richard lepsius s prussian expedition to egypt in in the scanpyramids team detected a cavity behind the entrance chevrons using muography which was confirmed in to be a corridor at least metres ft long running horizontal or sloping upwards thus not parallel to the descending passage whether or not it connects to the big void above the grand gallery remains to be seen today tourists enter the great pyramid via the robbers tunnel which was long ago cut straight through the masonry of the pyramid the entrance was forced into the th and th layer of the casing about metres ft above the base after running more or less straight and horizontal for metres ft it turns sharply left to encounter the blocking stones in the ascending passage it is possible to enter the descending passage from this point but access is usually forbidden the origin of this robbers tunnel is the subject of much scholarly discussion according to tradition the chasm was made around ad by caliph al ma mun s workmen with a battering ram the digging dislodged the stone in the ceiling of the descending passage which hid the entrance to the ascending passage and the noise of that stone falling then sliding down the descending passage alerted them to the need to turn left unable to remove these stones however the workmen tunneled up beside them through the softer limestone of the pyramid until they reached the ascending passage due to a number of historical and archaeological discrepancies many scholars with antoine de sacy perhaps being the first contend that this story is apocryphal they argue that it is much more likely that the tunnel had been carved shortly after the pyramid was initially sealed this tunnel the scholars continue was then resealed likely during the ramesside restoration and it was this plug that al ma mun s ninth century expedition cleared away this theory is furthered by the report of patriarch dionysius i telmaharoyo who claimed that before al ma mun s expedition there already existed a breach in the pyramid s north face that extended into the structure metres ft before hitting a dead end this suggests that some sort of robber s tunnel predated al ma mun and that the caliph simply enlarged it and cleared it of debris from the original entrance a passage descends through the masonry of the pyramid and then into the bedrock beneath it ultimately leading to the subterranean chamber it has a slanted height of egyptian feet m ft and a width of cubits m ft its angle of corresponds to a ratio of to rise over run after metres ft the lower end of the ascending passage is reached a square hole in the ceiling which is blocked by granite stones and might have originally been concealed to circumvent these hard stones a short tunnel was excavated that meets the end of the robbers tunnel this was expanded over time and fitted with stairs the passage continues to descend for another metres ft now through bedrock instead of the pyramid superstructure lazy guides used to block off this part with rubble to avoid having to lead people down and back up the long shaft until around when covington installed a padlocked iron grill door to stop this practice near the end of this section on the west wall is the connection to the vertical shaft that leads up to the grand gallery a horizontal shaft connects the end of the descending passage to the subterranean chamber it has a length of m ft width of cm ft and height of cm ft a recess is located towards the end of the western wall slightly larger than the tunnel the ceiling of which is irregular and undressed the subterranean chamber or pit is the lowest of the three main chambers and the only one dug into the bedrock beneath the pyramid located about m ft below base level it measures roughly cubits m ft north south by cubits m ft east west with an approximate height of m ft the western half of the room apart from the ceiling is unfinished with trenches left behind by the quarry men running east to west a niche was cut into the northern half of the west wall the only access through the descending passage lies on the eastern end of the north wall although seemingly known in antiquity according to herodotus and later authors its existence had been forgotten in the middle ages until rediscovery in when giovanni caviglia cleared the rubble blocking the descending passage opposing the entrance a blind corridor runs straight south for m ft and continues slight bent another m ft measuring about m ft squared a greek or roman character was found on its ceiling with the light of a candle suggesting that the chamber had indeed been accessible during classical antiquity in the middle of the eastern half a large hole is opened up called pit shaft or perring s shaft the upmost part may have ancient origins about m ft squared in width and m ft in depth diagonally aligned with the chamber caviglia and salt enlarged it to the depth of about m ft in vyse directed the shaft to be sunk to a depth of ft m in hopes of discovering the chamber encompassed by water that herodotus alludes to it is slightly narrower in width at about m ft no chamber was discovered after perring and his workers had spent one and a half years penetrating the bedrock to the then water level of the nile some m ft further down the rubble produced during this operation was deposited throughout the chamber petrie visiting in found the shaft to be partially filled with rainwater that had rushed down the descending passage in when the edgar brothers surveying activities were encumbered by the material they moved the sand and smaller stones back into the shaft leaving the upper part clear the deep modern shaft is sometimes mistaken to be part of the original design ludwig borchardt suggested that the subterranean chamber was originally planned to be the burial place for pharaoh khufu but that it was abandoned during construction in favour of a chamber higher up in the pyramid the ascending passage connects the descending passage to the grand gallery it is cubits m ft long and of the same width and height as the shaft it originates from although its angle is slightly lower at the lower end of the shaft is plugged by three granite stones which were slid down from the grand gallery to seal the tunnel they are m ft m ft and m ft long respectively the uppermost is heavily damaged hence it is shorter the end of the robbers tunnel concludes slightly below the stones so a short tunnel was dug around them to gain access to the descending passage since the surrounding limestone is considerably softer and easier to work most of the joints between the blocks of the walls run perpendicular to the floor with two exceptions firstly those in the lower third of the corridor are vertical secondly the three girdle stones that are inserted near the middle about cubits apart presumably to stabilize the tunnel the well shaft also known as the service shaft or vertical shaft links the lower end of the grand gallery to the bottom of descending passage about metres ft further down it takes a winding and indirect course the upper half goes through the nucleus masonry of the pyramid it runs vertical at first for metres ft then slightly angled southwards for about the same distance until it hits bedrock approximately metres ft above the pyramid s base level another vertical section descends further which is partially lined with masonry that has been broken through to a cavity known as the grotto the lower half of the well shaft goes through the bedrock at an angle of about for metres ft before a steeper section metres ft long leads to its lowest point the final section of metres ft connects it to the descending passage running almost horizontal the builders evidently had trouble aligning the lower exit the purpose of the shaft is commonly explained as a ventilation shaft for the subterranean chamber and as an escape shaft for the workers who slid the blocking stones of the ascending passage into place the grotto is a natural limestone cave that was likely filled with sand and gravel before construction before being hollowed out by looters a granite block rests in it that likely originated from the portcullis that once sealed the king s chamber the horizontal passage links the grand gallery to the queen s chamber five pairs of holes at the start suggest the tunnel was once concealed with slabs that laid flush with the gallery floor the passage is cubits m ft wide and m ft high for most of its length but near the chamber there is a step in the floor after which the passage increases to m ft high half of the west wall consists of two layers that have atypically continuous vertical joints dormion suggests the entrances to magazines laid here and have been filled in the queen s chamber is exactly halfway between the north and south faces of the pyramid it measures cubits m ft north south cubits m ft east west and has a pointed roof that apexes at cubits m ft tall at the eastern end of the chamber there is a niche cubits m ft high the original depth of the niche was cubits m ft but it has since been deepened by treasure hunters shafts were discovered in the north and south walls of the queen s chamber in by british engineer waynman dixon who believed shafts similar to those in the king s chamber must also exist the shafts were not connected to the outer faces of the pyramid or the queen s chamber their purpose is unknown in one shaft dixon discovered a ball of diorite a bronze hook of unknown purpose and a piece of cedar wood the first two objects are currently in the british museum the latter was lost until recently when it was found at the university of aberdeen it has since been radiocarbon dated to bc the northern shaft s angle of ascent fluctuates and at one point turns degrees to avoid the great gallery the southern shaft is perpendicular to the pyramid s slope the shafts in the queen s chamber were explored in by the german engineer rudolf gantenbrink using a crawler robot he designed upuaut after a climb of m ft he discovered that one of the shafts was blocked by a limestone door with two eroded copper handles the national geographic society created a similar robot which in september drilled a small hole in the southern door only to find another stone slab behind it the northern passage which was difficult to navigate because of its twists and turns was also found to be blocked by a slab research continued in with the djedi project which used a fibre optic micro snake camera that could see around corners with this they were able to penetrate the first door of the southern shaft through the hole drilled in and view all the sides of the small chamber behind it they discovered hieroglyphics written in red paint egyptian mathematics researcher luca miatello stated that the markings read the length of the shaft in cubits the djedi team were also able to scrutinize the inside of the two copper handles embedded in the door which they now believe to be for decorative purposes they additionally found the reverse side of the door to be finished and polished which suggests that it was not put there just to block the shaft from debris but rather for a more specific reason the grand gallery continues the slope of the ascending passage towards the king s chamber extending from the rd to the th course a rise of metres ft it has been praised as a truly spectacular example of stonemasonry it is metres ft high and metres ft long the base is cubits m ft wide but after two courses at a height of metres ft the blocks of stone in the walls are corbelled inwards by centimetres in on each side there are seven of these steps so at the top the grand gallery is only cubits m ft wide it is roofed by slabs of stone laid at a slightly steeper angle than the floor so that each stone fits into a slot cut into the top of the gallery like the teeth of a ratchet the purpose was to have each block supported by the wall of the gallery rather than resting on the block beneath it in order to prevent cumulative pressure at the upper end of the gallery on the eastern wall there is a hole near the roof that opens into a short tunnel by which access can be gained to the lowest of the relieving chambers the floor of the grand gallery has a shelf or step on either side cubit cm in wide leaving a lower ramp cubits m ft wide between them there are slots on the shelves with on each side on each wall niches have been cut above the slots the purpose of these slots is not known but the central gutter in the floor of the gallery which is the same width as the ascending passage has led to speculation that the blocking stones were stored in the grand gallery and the slots held wooden beams to restrain them from sliding down the passage jean pierre houdin theorized that they held a timber frame that was used in combination with a trolley to pull the heavy granite blocks up the pyramid at the top of the gallery there is a step onto a small horizontal platform where a tunnel leads through the antechamber once blocked by portcullis stones into the king s chamber in scientists from the scanpyramids project discovered a large cavity above the grand gallery using muon radiography which they called the scanpyramids big void key was a research team under morishima kunihiro a professor at nagoya university that used special nuclear emulsion detectors its length is at least metres ft and its cross section is similar to that of the grand gallery its existence was confirmed by independent detection with three different technologies nuclear emulsion films scintillator hodoscopes and gas detectors the purpose of the cavity is unknown and it is not accessible zahi hawass speculates it may have been a gap used in the construction of the grand gallery but the japanese research team state that the void is completely different from previously identified construction spaces to verify and pinpoint the void a team from kyushu university tohoku university the university of tokyo and the chiba institute of technology planned to rescan the structure with a newly developed muon detector in their work was delayed by the covid pandemic the last line of defense against intrusion was a small chamber specially designed to house portcullis blocking stones called the antechamber it is cased almost entirely in granite and is situated between the upper end of the grand gallery and the king s chamber three slots for portcullis stones line the east and west wall of the chamber each of them is topped with a semi circular groove for a log around which ropes could be spanned the granite portcullis stones were approximately cubit cm in thick and were lowered into position by the aforementioned ropes which were tied through a series of four holes at the top of the blocks a corresponding set of four vertical grooves are on the south wall of the chamber recesses that make space for the ropes the antechamber has a design flaw the space above them can be accessed thus all but the last block can be circumvented this was exploited by looters who punched a hole through the ceiling of the tunnel behind gaining access to the king s chamber later on all three portcullis stones were broken and removed fragments of these blocks can be found in various locations in the pyramid the pit shaft the original entrance the grotto and the recess before the subterranean chamber the king s chamber is the upmost of the three main chambers of the pyramid it is faced entirely with granite and measures cubits m ft east west by cubits m ft north south its flat ceiling is about cubits and digits m ft above the floor formed by nine slabs of stone weighing in total about tons all the roof beams show cracks due to the chamber having settled cm in the walls consist of five courses of blocks that are uninscribed as was the norm for burial chambers of the th dynasty the stones are precisely fitted together the facing surfaces are dressed to varying degrees with some displaying remains of bosses not entirely cut away the back sides of the blocks were only roughly hewn to shape as was usual with egyptian hard stone facade blocks presumably to save work the only object in the king s chamber is a sarcophagus made out of a single hollowed out granite block when it was rediscovered in the early middle ages it was found broken open and any contents had already been removed it is of the form common for early egyptian sarcophagi rectangular in shape with grooves to slide the now missing lid into place with three small holes for pegs to fixate it the coffer was not perfectly smoothed displaying various tool marks matching those of copper saws and tubular hand drills the internal dimensions are roughly cm ft by cm feet the external cm ft by cm ft with a height of cm ft the walls have a thickness of about cm ft the sarcophagus is too large to fit around the corner between the ascending and descending passages which indicates that it must have been placed in the chamber before the roof was put in place in the north and south walls of the king s chamber are two narrow shafts commonly known as air shafts they face each other and are located approximately m ft above the floor m ft from the eastern wall with a width of and cm and in and a height of cm in both start out horizontally for the length of the granite blocks they go through before changing to an upwards direction the southern shaft ascends at an angle of with a slight curve westwards one ceiling stone was found to be distinctly unfinished which gantenbrink called a monday morning block the northern shaft changes angle several times shifting the path to the west perhaps to avoid the big void the builders had trouble calculating the right angles resulting in parts of the shaft being narrower nowadays they both commute to the exterior if they originally penetrated the outer casing is unknown the purpose of these shafts is not clear they were long believed by egyptologists to be shafts for ventilation but this idea has now been widely abandoned in favour of the shafts serving a ritualistic purpose associated with the ascension of the king s spirit to the heavens the idea that the shafts point towards stars or areas of the northern and southern skies has been largely dismissed as the northern shaft follows a dog leg course through the masonry and the southern shaft has a bend of approximately centimetres in indicating no intention to have them point to any celestial objects in as part of the upuaut project a ventilation system was installed in both air shafts of the king s chamber above the roof of the king s chamber are five compartments named from lowest upwards davison s chamber wellington s chamber nelson s chamber lady arbuthnot s chamber and campbell s chamber they were presumably intended to safeguard the king s chamber from the possibility of the roof collapsing under the weight of stone above hence they are referred to as relieving chambers the granite blocks that divide the chambers have flat bottom sides but roughly shaped top sides giving all five chambers an irregular floor but a flat ceiling with the exception of the uppermost chamber which has a pointed limestone roof nathaniel davison is credited with the discovery of the lowest of these chambers in although a french merchant named maynard informed him of its existence it can be reached through an ancient passage that originates from the top of the south wall of the grand gallery the upper four chambers were discovered in by howard vyse after discovering a crack in the ceiling of the first chamber this allowed the insertion of a long reed which with the employment of gunpowder and boring rods forced a tunnel upwards through the masonry as no access shafts existed for the upper four chambers unlike davison s chamber they were completely inaccessible until this point numerous graffiti of red ochre paint were found to cover the limestone walls of all four newly discovered chambers apart from leveling lines and indication marks for masons multiple hieroglyphic inscriptions spell out the names of work gangs those names which were also found in other egyptian pyramids like that of menkaure and sahure usually included the name of the pharaoh they were working for the blocks must have received the inscriptions before the chambers became inaccessible during construction their orientation often side ways or upside down and their sometimes being partially covered by blocks seems to indicate that the stones were inscribed before being laid the inscriptions correctly deciphered only decades after discovery read as follows the great pyramid is surrounded by a complex of several buildings including small pyramids the pyramid temple which stood on the east side of the pyramid and measured metres ft north to south and metres ft east to west has almost entirely disappeared only some of the black basalt paving has remained there are only a few remnants of the causeway which linked the pyramid with the valley and the valley temple the valley temple is buried beneath the village of nazlet el samman basalt paving and limestone walls have been found but the site has not been excavated the tomb of queen hetepheres i sister wife of sneferu and mother of khufu is located approximately metres ft east of the great pyramid discovered by accident by the reisner expedition the burial was intact although the carefully sealed coffin proved to be empty on the southern end of the east side are four subsidiary pyramids the three that remain standing to almost full height are popularly known as the queens pyramids g a g b and g c the fourth smaller satellite pyramid g d was so ruined that its existence was not suspected until the first course of stones and later the remains of the capstone were discovered during excavations in three boat shaped pits are located east of the pyramid they are large enough in size and shape to have held complete boats though so shallow that any superstructure if there ever was one must have been removed or disassembled two additional boat pits long and rectangular in shape were found south of the pyramid still covered with slabs of stone weighing up to tons the first of these was discovered in may by the egyptian archaeologist kamal el mallakh inside were pieces of wood the longest metres ft in length the shortest centimetres ft these were entrusted to a boat builder haj ahmed yusuf who worked out how the pieces fit together the entire process including conservation and straightening of the warped wood took fourteen years the result is a cedar wood boat metres ft long its timbers held together by ropes which was originally housed in the giza solar boat museum a special boat shaped air conditioned museum beside the pyramid it is now in the grand egyptian museum during construction of this museum in the s the second sealed boat pit was discovered it was left unopened until when excavation began on the boat a notable construction flanking the giza pyramid complex is a cyclopean stone wall the wall of the crow mark lehner discovered a worker s town outside of the wall otherwise known as the lost city dated by pottery styles seal impressions and stratigraphy to have been constructed and occupied sometime during the reigns of khafre bc and menkaure bc in the early st century lehner and his team made several discoveries including what appears to have been a thriving port suggesting the town and associated living quarters which consisted of barracks called galleries may not have been for the pyramid workers after all but rather for the soldiers and sailors who used the port in light of this new discovery as to where then the pyramid workers may have lived lehner suggested the alternative possibility they may have camped on the ramps he believes were used to construct the pyramids or possibly at nearby quarries in the early s the australian archaeologist karl kromer excavated a mound in the south field of the plateau it was found to contain artefacts including mudbrick seals of khufu which he identified with an artisans settlement mudbrick buildings just south of khufu s valley temple contained mud sealings of khufu and have been suggested to be a settlement serving the cult of khufu after his death a worker s cemetery used at least between khufu s reign and the end of the fifth dynasty was discovered south of the wall of the crow by hawass in authors bob brier and hoyt hobbs claim that all the pyramids were robbed by the new kingdom when the construction of royal tombs in the valley of the kings began joyce tyldesley states that the great pyramid itself is known to have been opened and emptied by the middle kingdom before the arab caliph al ma mun entered the pyramid around ad i e s edwards discusses strabo s mention that the pyramid a little way up one side has a stone that may be taken out which being raised up there is a sloping passage to the foundations edwards suggested that the pyramid was entered by robbers after the end of the old kingdom and sealed and then reopened more than once until strabo s door was added he adds if this highly speculative surmise be correct it is also necessary to assume either that the existence of the door was forgotten or that the entrance was again blocked with facing stones in order to explain why al ma mun could not find the entrance scholars such as gaston maspero and flinders petrie have noted that evidence for a similar door has been found at the bent pyramid of dashur herodotus visited egypt in the th century bc and recounts a story that he was told concerning vaults under the pyramid built on an island where the body of khufu lies edwards notes that the pyramid had almost certainly been opened and its contents plundered long before the time of herodotus and that it might have been closed again during the twenty sixth dynasty of egypt when other monuments were restored he suggests that the story told to herodotus could have been the result of almost two centuries of telling and retelling by pyramid guides

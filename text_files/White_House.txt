 the white house is the official residence and workplace of the president of the united states it is located at pennsylvania avenue nw in washington d c and has been the residence of every u s president since john adams in the term white house is often used as a metonym for the president and his advisers the residence was designed by irish born architect james hoban in the neoclassical style hoban modelled the building on leinster house in dublin a building which today houses the oireachtas the irish legislature construction took place between and using aquia creek sandstone painted white when thomas jefferson moved into the house in he with architect benjamin henry latrobe added low colonnades on each wing that concealed stables and storage in during the war of the mansion was set ablaze by the british army in the burning of washington destroying the interior and charring much of the exterior reconstruction began almost immediately and president james monroe moved into the partially reconstructed executive residence in october exterior construction continued with the addition of the semi circular south portico in and the north portico in because of crowding within the executive mansion itself president theodore roosevelt had all work offices relocated to the newly constructed west wing in eight years later in president william howard taft expanded the west wing and created the first oval office which was eventually moved as the section was expanded in the main mansion executive residence the third floor attic was converted to living quarters in by augmenting the existing hip roof with long shed dormers a newly constructed east wing was used as a reception area for social events jefferson s colonnades connected the new wings the east wing alterations were completed in creating additional office space by the residence s load bearing walls and wood beams were found to be close to failure under harry s truman the interior rooms were completely dismantled and a new internal load bearing steel frame was constructed inside the walls on the exterior the truman balcony was added once the structural work was completed the interior rooms were rebuilt the modern day white house complex includes the executive residence the west wing the east wing the eisenhower executive office building the former state department which now houses offices for the president s staff and the vice president and blair house a guest residence the executive residence is made up of six stories the ground floor state floor second floor and third floor as well as a two story basement the property is a national heritage site owned by the national park service and is part of the president s park in it was ranked second on the american institute of architects list of america s favorite architecture following his april inauguration president george washington occupied two private houses in new york city as the executive mansion he lived at the first known as the franklin house and owned by treasury commissioner samuel osgood at cherry street through late february the executive mansion moved to the larger quarters of the alexander macomb house at broadway where he stayed with his wife and a small staff until august in may construction began on a new official residence in manhattan called government house washington never lived at the government house however since the national capitol was moved to philadelphia and then to washington d c before its completion the july residence act designated the capital be permanently located in the new federal district and temporarily in philadelphia pennsylvania for ten years while the permanent capital was built philadelphia rented the mansion of the wealthy merchant robert morris at high street now market street as the president s house which washington occupied from november to march since the house was too small to accommodate the thirty people who made up the presidential family staff and servants washington had it enlarged president john adams also occupied the high street mansion from march to may on saturday november he became the first president to occupy the white house the president s house in philadelphia was converted into the union hotel and later used for stores before being demolished in philadelphia began construction of a much grander presidential mansion several blocks away in it was nearly completed by the time of adams inauguration however adams declined to occupy it saying he did not have congressional authorization to lease the building it remained vacant until it was sold to the university of pennsylvania in first presidential mansion samuel osgood house manhattan new york occupied by washington april february second presidential mansion alexander macomb house manhattan new york occupied by washington february august third presidential mansion president s house philadelphia pennsylvania occupied by washington november march occupied by adams march may government house manhattan new york built to be the permanent presidential mansion congress moved the national capital to philadelphia before its completion house intended for the president philadelphia pennsylvania s built to be the permanent presidential mansion it was not used by any president the president s house was a major feature of pierre peter charles l enfant s a plan for the newly established federal city of washington d c washington and his secretary of state thomas jefferson who both had personal interests in architecture agreed that the design of the white house and the capitol would be chosen in a design competition nine proposals were submitted for the new presidential residence with the award going to irish american architect james hoban hoban ultimately supervised the construction of both the us capitol and the white house hoban was born in ireland and trained at the dublin society of arts he emigrated to the us after the revolution first seeking work in philadelphia and later finding success in south carolina where he designed the state capitol in columbia president washington visited charleston south carolina in may on his southern tour and saw the under construction charleston county courthouse designed by hoban he is reputed to have met with hoban then the following year he summoned the architect to philadelphia and met with him in june on july the president met with the commissioners of the federal city to make his judgment in the architectural competition his review is recorded as being brief and he quickly selected hoban s submission the neoclassical design of the white house is based primarily on ideas inherited from the roman architect vitruvius and the venetian architect andrea palladio the design of the upper floors also includes elements based on dublin s leinster house which later became the seat of the irish parliament oireachtas the upper windows with alternate triangular and segmented pediments for example are directly inspired by the irish building additionally several georgian era irish country houses have been suggested as sources of inspiration for the overall floor plan including the bow fronted south front and the former niches in the present day blue room the first official white house guide published in suggested a link between hoban s design for the south portico and ch teau de rastignac a neoclassical country house located in la bachellerie in the dordogne region of france and designed by mathurin salat construction on the french house was initially started before interrupted by the french revolution for twenty years and then finally built between and based on salat s pre design the theoretical link between the two houses has been criticized because hoban did not visit france supporters of the connection posit that thomas jefferson during his tour of bordeaux in viewed salat s architectural drawings which were on file at the college at the cole sp ciale d architecture bordeaux architectural college on his return to the us he then shared the influence with washington hoban monroe and benjamin henry latrobe construction of the white house began at noon on october with the laying of the cornerstone the main residence as well as the foundations of the house were built largely by enslaved and free african american laborers as well as employed europeans much of the other work on the house was done by immigrants many of them without citizenship yet the sandstone walls were erected by scottish immigrants employed by hoban as were the high relief rose and garland decorations above the north entrance and the fish scale pattern beneath the pediments of the window hoods there are conflicting claims as to where the sandstone used in the construction of the white house originated some reports suggest sandstone from the croatian island of bra specifically the pu i a quarry whose stone was used to build the ancient diocletian s palace in split was used in the original construction of the building however researchers believe limestone from the island was used in the renovations and not the original construction others suggest the original sandstone simply came from aquia creek in stafford county virginia as importing the stone would be too costly the initial construction took place over a period of eight years at a reported cost of equivalent to in although not yet completed the white house was ready for occupancy circa november due in part to material and labor shortages pierre charles l enfant s plan for a grand palace was five times larger than the house that was eventually built the finished structure contained only two main floors instead of the planned three and a less costly brick served as a lining for the stone fa ades when construction was finished the porous sandstone walls were whitewashed with a mixture of lime rice glue casein and lead giving the house its familiar color and name the main entrance is located on the north fa ade under a porte cochere with ionic columns the ground floor is hidden by a raised carriage ramp and parapet the central three bays are situated behind a prostyle portico that was added circa the windows of the four bays flanking the portico at first floor level have alternating pointed and segmented pediments while the second floor pediments are flat a lunette fanlight and a sculpted floral festoon surmount the entrance the roofline is hidden by a balustraded parapet the three level southern fa ade combines palladian and neoclassical architectural styles the ground floor is rusticated in the palladian fashion the south portico was completed in at the center of the southern fa ade is a neoclassical projected bow of three bays the bow is flanked by five bays the windows of which as on the north fa ade have alternating segmented and pointed pediments at first floor level the bow has a ground floor double staircase leading to an ionic colonnaded loggia and the truman balcony built in the more modern third floor is hidden by a balustraded parapet and plays no part in the composition of the fa ade the building was originally variously referred to as the president s palace presidential mansion or president s house the earliest evidence of the public calling it the white house was recorded in a myth emerged that during the rebuilding of the structure after the burning of washington white paint was applied to mask the burn damage it had suffered giving the building its namesake hue the name executive mansion was used in official contexts until president theodore roosevelt established the white house as its formal name in via executive order the current letterhead wording and arrangement of the white house with the word washington centered beneath it dates to the administration of franklin d roosevelt although the structure was not completed until some years after the presidency of george washington there is speculation that the name of the traditional residence of the president of the united states may have been derived from martha washington s home white house plantation in virginia where the nation s first president courted the first lady in the mid th century on saturday november john adams became the first president to take residence in the building the next day he wrote his wife abigail i pray heaven to bestow the best of blessings on this house and all that shall hereafter inhabit it may none but honest and wise men ever rule under this roof president franklin d roosevelt had adams s blessing carved into the mantel in the state dining room adams lived in the house only briefly before thomas jefferson moved into the pleasant country residence in despite his complaints that the house was too big big enough for two emperors one pope and the grand lama in the bargain jefferson considered how the white house might be added to with benjamin henry latrobe he helped lay out the design for the east and west colonnades small wings that help conceal the domestic operations of laundry a stable and storage today jefferson s colonnades link the residence with the east and west wings in during the war of the white house was set ablaze by british troops during the burning of washington in retaliation for attacking and burning toronto then called york port dover and other towns in upper canada much of washington was affected by these fires as well only the exterior walls remained and they had to be torn down and mostly reconstructed because of weakening from the fire and subsequent exposure to the elements except for portions of the south wall of the numerous objects taken from the white house when it was ransacked by british troops only three have been recovered employees and slaves rescued a painting of george washington in a canadian man returned a jewelry box to president franklin roosevelt claiming that his grandfather had taken it from washington and also in a medicine chest that had belonged to president madison was returned by the descendants of a british naval officer some observers allege that most of these spoils were lost when a convoy of british ships led by hms fantome sank en route to halifax off prospect during a storm on the night of november even though fantome had no involvement in that action after the fire president james madison resided in the octagon house from to and then in the seven buildings from to the end of his term meanwhile both hoban and latrobe contributed to the design and oversight of the reconstruction which lasted from until the south portico was constructed in during the james monroe administration the north portico was built six years later though latrobe proposed similar porticos before the fire in both porticos were built as designed by hoban an elliptical portico at ch teau de rastignac in la bachellerie france with nearly identical curved stairs is speculated as the source of inspiration due to its similarity with the south portico although this matter is one of great debate italian artisans brought to washington to help in constructing the u s capitol carved the decorative stonework on both porticos contrary to speculation the north portico was not modeled on a similar portico on another dublin building the viceregal lodge now ras an uachtar in residence of the president of ireland for its portico postdates the white house porticos design for the north portico a variation on the ionic order was devised incorporating a swag of roses between the volutes this was done to link the new portico with the earlier carved roses above the entrance the white house as it looked following the fire of august jefferson and latrobe s west wing colonnade in this nineteenth century engraved view is now the james s brady press briefing room principal story plan for the white house by benjamin henry latrobe earliest known photograph of the white house taken c by john plumbe during the administration of james k polk by the time of the american civil war the white house had become overcrowded the location of the white house just north of a canal and swampy lands which provided conditions ripe for malaria and other unhealthy conditions was questioned brigadier general nathaniel michler was tasked with proposing solutions to address these concerns he proposed abandoning the use of the white house as a residence and he designed a new estate for the first family at meridian hill in washington d c congress however rejected the plan another option was metropolis view which is now the campus of the catholic university of america when chester a arthur took office in he ordered renovations to the white house to take place as soon as the recently widowed lucretia garfield moved out arthur inspected the work almost nightly and made several suggestions louis comfort tiffany was asked to send selected designers to assist over twenty wagonloads of furniture and household items were removed from the building and sold at a public auction all that was saved were bust portraits of john adams and martin van buren a proposal was made to build a new residence south of the white house but it failed to gain support in the fall of work was done on the main corridor including tinting the walls pale olive and adding squares of gold leaf and decorating the ceiling in gold and silver with colorful traceries woven to spell usa the red room was painted a dull pomeranian red and its ceiling was decorated with gold silver and copper stars and stripes of red white and blue a fifty foot jeweled tiffany glass screen supported by imitation marble columns replaced the glass doors that separated the main corridor from the north vestibule in first lady caroline harrison proposed major extensions to the white house including a national wing on the east for a historical art gallery and a wing on the west for official functions a plan was devised by colonel theodore a bingham that reflected the harrison proposal these plans were ultimately rejected however in theodore roosevelt hired mckim mead white to carry out expansions and renovations in a neoclassical style suited to the building s architecture removing the tiffany screen and all victorian additions charles mckim himself designed and managed the project which gave more living space to the president s large family by removing a staircase in the west hall and moving executive office staff from the second floor of the residence into the new west wing president william howard taft enlisted the help of architect nathan c wyeth to add additional space to the west wing which included the addition of the oval office in congress enacted legislation allowing the white house to accept gifts of furniture and art for the first time the west wing was damaged by fire on christmas eve herbert hoover and his aides moved back into it on april in the s a second story was added as well as a larger basement for white house staff and president franklin roosevelt had the oval office moved to its present location adjacent to the rose garden decades of poor maintenance the construction of a fourth story attic during the coolidge administration and the addition of a second floor balcony over the south portico for harry s truman took a great toll on the brick and sandstone structure built around a timber frame by the house was declared to be in imminent danger of collapse forcing president truman to commission a reconstruction and to live across the street at blair house from to the work done by the firm of philadelphia contractor john mcshain required the complete dismantling of the interior spaces construction of a new load bearing internal steel frame and the reconstruction of the original rooms within the new structure the total cost of the renovations was about million million in some modifications to the floor plan were made the largest being the repositioning of the grand staircase to open into the entrance hall rather than the cross hall central air conditioning was added as well as two additional sub basements providing space for workrooms storage and a bomb shelter the trumans moved back into the white house on march while the truman reconstruction preserved the house s structure much of the new interior finishes were generic and of little historic significance much of the original plasterwork some dating back to the rebuilding was too damaged to reinstall as was the original robust beaux arts paneling in the east room president truman had the original timber frame sawed into paneling the walls of the vermeil room library china room and map room on the ground floor of the main residence were paneled in wood from the timbers jacqueline kennedy wife of president john f kennedy directed a very extensive and historic redecoration of the house she enlisted the help of henry francis du pont of the winterthur museum to assist in collecting artifacts for the mansion many of which had once been housed there other antiques fine paintings and improvements from the kennedy period were donated to the white house by wealthy philanthropists including the crowninshield family jane engelhard jayne wrightsman and the oppenheimer family st phane boudin of the house of jansen a paris interior design firm that had been recognized worldwide was employed by jacqueline kennedy to assist with the decoration different periods of the early republic and world history were selected as a theme for each room the federal style for the green room french empire for the blue room american empire for the red room louis xvi for the yellow oval room and victorian for the president s study renamed the treaty room antique furniture was acquired and decorative fabric and trim based on period documents was produced and installed the kennedy restoration resulted in a more authentic white house of grander stature which recalled the french taste of madison and monroe in the diplomatic reception room mrs kennedy installed an antique vue de l am rique nord wallpaper which zuber cie had designed in the wallpaper had hung previously on the walls of another mansion until when that house was demolished for a grocery store just before the demolition the wallpaper was salvaged and sold to the white house the first white house guidebook was produced under the direction of curator lorraine waxman pearce with direct supervision from mrs kennedy sales of the guidebook helped finance the restoration in a televised tour of the house on valentine s day in kennedy showed her restoration of the white house to the public congress enacted legislation in september declaring the white house a museum furniture fixtures and decorative arts could now be declared either historic or of artistic interest by the president this prevented them from being sold as many objects in the executive mansion had been in the past years when not in use or display at the white house these items were to be turned over to the smithsonian institution for preservation study storage or exhibition the white house retains the right to have these items returned out of respect for the historic character of the white house no substantive architectural changes have been made to the house since the truman renovation since the kennedy restoration every presidential family has made some changes to the private quarters of the white house but the committee for the preservation of the white house must approve any modifications to the state rooms charged with maintaining the historical integrity of the white house the congressionally authorized committee works with each first family usually represented by the first lady the white house curator and the chief usher to implement the family s proposals for altering the house during the nixon administration first lady pat nixon refurbished the green room blue room and red room working with clement conger the curator appointed by president richard nixon mrs nixon s efforts brought more than artifacts to the house the largest acquisition by any administration her husband created the modern press briefing room over franklin roosevelt s old swimming pool nixon also added a single lane bowling alley to the white house basement computers and the first laser printer were added during the carter administration and the use of computer technology was expanded during the reagan administration a carter era innovation a set of solar water heating panels that were mounted on the roof of the white house was removed during reagan s presidency redecorations were made to the private family quarters and maintenance was made to public areas during the reagan years the house was accredited as a museum in in the s bill and hillary

during the administration of george w bush first lady laura bush refurbished the lincoln bedroom in a style contemporary with the lincoln era the green room cabinet room and theater were also refurbished the white house became one of the first wheelchair accessible government buildings in washington when modifications were made during the presidency of franklin d roosevelt who used a wheelchair because of his paralytic illness in the s hillary clinton at the suggestion of visitors office director melinda n bates approved the addition of a ramp in the east wing corridor it allowed easy wheelchair access for the public tours and special events that enter through the secure entrance building on the east side in the bush administration reinstalled solar thermal heaters these units are used to heat water for landscape maintenance personnel and for the presidential pool and spa one hundred sixty seven solar photovoltaic grid tied panels were installed at the same time on the roof of the maintenance facility the changes were not publicized as a white house spokeswoman said the changes were an internal matter the story was picked up by industry trade journals in president barack obama had a set of solar panels installed on the roof of the white house making it the first time solar power would be used for the president s living quarters today the group of buildings housing the

the press briefing room adding fiber optic cables and lcd screens for the display of charts and graphs the makeover took months and cost of million out of which news outlets paid million in september a two year project began on the west wing creating a multistory underground structure some members of the president s staff are located in the adjacent eisenhower executive office building which was until called the old executive office building and was historically the state war and navy building the oval office roosevelt room and other portions of the west wing were partially replicated on a sound stage and used as the setting for the west wing television show the east wing which contains additional office space was added to the white house in among its uses the east wing has intermittently housed the offices and staff of the first lady and the white house social office rosalynn carter in was the first to place her personal office in the east wing and to formally call it the office of the first lady the east wing was built during world war ii in order to hide the construction of an underground bunker to be used in emergencies the bunker has come to be known as the presidential emergency operations center the white house and grounds cover just over acres about hectares before the construction of the north portico most public events were entered from the south lawn the grading and planting of which was ordered by thomas jefferson jefferson also drafted a planting plan for the north lawn that included large trees that would have mostly obscured the house from pennsylvania avenue during the mid to late th century a series of ever larger greenhouses were built on the west side of the house where the current west wing is located during this period the north lawn was planted with ornate carpet style flowerbeds the general layout of the white house grounds today is based on the design by frederick law olmsted jr of the olmsted brothers firm commissioned by president franklin d roosevelt during the kennedy administration the white house rose garden was redesigned by rachel lambert mellon the rose garden borders the west colonnade bordering the east colonnade is the jacqueline kennedy garden which was begun by jacqueline kennedy but completed after her husband s assassination on the weekend of june a century old american elm ulmus americana l tree on the north side of the building came down during one of the many storms amid intense flooding among the oldest trees on the grounds are several magnolias magnolia grandiflora planted by andrew jackson including the jackson magnolia reportedly grown from a sprout taken from the favorite tree of jackson s recently deceased wife the sprout planted after jackson moved into the white house the tree stood for over years but in having become too weak to stand on its own it was decided it should be removed and replaced with one of its offspring michelle obama planted the white house s first organic garden and installed beehives on the south lawn of the white house which will supply organic produce and honey to the first family and for state dinners and other official gatherings in first lady melania trump redesigned the rose garden the cross hall connecting the state dining room and the east room on the state floor marine one prepares to land on the south lawn where state arrival ceremonies are held view from the south with south fountain view from the north with north fountain white house at night view from the north like the english and irish country houses it was modeled on the white house was from the start open to the public until the early part of the th century president thomas jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in and many of the people at his swearing in ceremony at the capitol followed him home where he greeted them in the blue room those open houses sometimes became rowdy in president andrew jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly citizens celebrated his inauguration inside the white house his aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey even so the practice continued until when newly elected grover cleveland arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the white house instead of the traditional open house inspired by washington s open houses in new york and philadelphia john adams began the tradition of the white house new year s reception jefferson also permitted public tours of his house which have continued ever since except during wartime and began the tradition of an annual reception on the fourth of july those receptions ended in the early s although president bill clinton briefly revived the new year s day open house in his first term in february a stolen army helicopter landed without authorization on the white house s grounds twenty years later in a light plane flown by frank eugene corder crashed on the white house grounds and he died instantly as a result of increased security regarding air traffic in the capital the white house was evacuated in may before an unauthorized aircraft could approach the grounds on may primarily as a response to the oklahoma city bombing of april the united states secret service closed off pennsylvania avenue to vehicular traffic in front of the white house from the eastern edge of lafayette park to th street later the closure was extended an additional block to the east to th street and east executive avenue a small street between the white house and the treasury building after september this change was made permanent in addition to closing e street between the south portico of the white house and the ellipse in response to the boston marathon bombing the road was closed to the public in its entirety for a period of two days the pennsylvania avenue closure has been opposed by organized civic groups in washington d c they argue that the closing impedes traffic flow unnecessarily and is inconsistent with the well conceived historic plan for the city as for security considerations they note that the white house is set much farther back from the street than numerous other sensitive federal buildings are prior to its inclusion within the fenced compound that now includes the old executive office building to the west and the treasury building to the east this sidewalk clarification needed served as a queuing area for the daily public tours of the white house these tours were suspended in the wake of the september attacks in september they resumed on a limited basis for groups making prior arrangements through their congressional representatives or embassies in washington for foreign nationals and submitting to background checks but the white house remained closed to the public due to budget constraints white house tours were suspended for most of due to sequestration the white house reopened to the public in november the white house complex is protected by the united states secret service and the united states park police during the presidential inauguration nasams norwegian advanced surface to air missile system units were used to patrol the airspace over washington d c the same units have since been used to protect the president and all airspace around the white house which is strictly prohibited to aircraft

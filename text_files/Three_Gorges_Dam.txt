 the three gorges dam is a hydroelectric gravity dam that spans the yangtze river by the town of sandouping in yiling district yichang hubei province central china downstream of the three gorges the three gorges dam has been the world s largest power station in terms of installed capacity mw since the dam generates an average twh of electricity per year depending on annual amount of precipitation in the river basin after the extensive monsoon rainfalls of the dam s annual production nearly reached twh breaking the previous world record of twh set by itaipu dam in the dam body was completed in the power plant of the dam project was completed and fully functional as of july when the last of the main water turbines in the underground plant began production each main water turbine has a capacity of mw coupling the dam s main turbines with two smaller generators mw each to power the plant itself the total electric generating capacity of the dam is mw the last major component of the project the ship lift was completed in december as well as producing electricity the dam is intended to increase the yangtze river s shipping capacity by providing flood storage space the dam reduces the potential for floods downstream which have historically plagued the yangtze plain in floods on the river caused the deaths of up to million people as a result china regards the project as a monumental social and economical success with the design of state of the art large turbines and a move toward limiting greenhouse gas emissions however the dam has caused ecological changes including an increased risk of landslides because of that the dam has been controversial both domestically and abroad a large dam across the yangtze river was originally envisioned by sun yat sen in the international development of china in he stated that a dam capable of generating million horsepower gw was possible downstream of the three gorges in the nationalist government led by chiang kai shek began preliminary work on plans in the three gorges in during the second sino japanese war japanese military forces occupied yichang and surveyed the area a design the otani plan was completed for the dam in anticipation of a japanese victory over china citation needed in the united states bureau of reclamation s head design engineer john l savage surveyed the area and drew up a dam proposal for the yangtze river project some chinese engineers went to the u s a for training the original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships the ships would enter locks located at the lower and upper ends of the dam and then cranes would move the ships from one lock to the next groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency it is not known whether this solution was considered for its water saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river above and below the dam too great for alternative methods some exploration survey economic study and design work was done but the government in the midst of the chinese civil war halted work in after the communist revolution mao zedong supported the project but began the gezhouba dam project nearby first and economic problems including the great leap forward and the cultural revolution slowed progress after the yangtze river floods in mao zedong wrote swimming a poem about his fascination with a dam on the yangtze river in after the hundred flowers campaign some engineers who spoke out against the project were imprisoned during the s the idea of a dam reemerged the national people s congress approved the dam in out of delegates voted in favour voted against abstained and members did not vote giving the legislation an unusually low approval rate construction started on december the dam was expected to be fully operational in but additional projects such as the underground power plant with six additional generators delayed full operation until may the ship lift was completed in the dam had raised the water level in the reservoir to m ft above sea level by the end of and to the designed maximum level of m ft by october made of concrete and steel the dam is m ft long and the top of the dam is m ft above sea level the project used million m million cu yd of concrete mainly for the dam wall used tonnes of steel enough to build eiffel towers and moved about million m million cu yd of earth the concrete dam wall is m ft high above the rock basis when the water level is at its maximum of m ft above sea level m ft higher than the river level downstream the dam reservoir is on average about km mi in length and km ft in width it contains km acre ft of water and has a total surface area of km sq mi on completion the reservoir flooded a total area of km sq mi of land compared to the km sq mi of reservoir created by the itaipu dam the government estimated that the three gorges dam project would cost billion yuan us billion by the end of spending had reached billion yuan among which billion yuan was spent on construction billion yuan on relocating affected residents and billion yuan on financing it was estimated in that the construction cost would be recovered when the dam had generated terawatt hours pj of electricity yielding billion yuan full cost recovery was thus expected to occur ten years after the dam started full operation and the full cost of the three gorges dam was recovered by december funding sources include the three gorges dam construction fund profits from the gezhouba dam loans from the china development bank loans from domestic and foreign commercial banks corporate bonds and revenue from both before and after the dam was fully operational additional charges were assessed as follows every province receiving power from the three gorges dam had to pay per mwh extra other provinces had to pay an additional charge of per mwh the tibet autonomous region pays no surcharge power generation is managed by china yangtze power a listed subsidiary of china three gorges corporation ctgc a central enterprise soe administered by sasac the three gorges dam is the world s largest capacity hydroelectric power station with generators main generators each with a capacity of mw and two plant power generators each with capacity of mw making a total capacity of mw among those main generators are installed in the north side of the dam in the south side and the remaining six in the underground power plant in the mountain south of the dam annual electricity generation in was twh which is times more than the hoover dam the main generators weigh about tonnes each and are designed to produce more than mw of power the designed hydraulic head of the generator is metres ft the flow rate varies between cubic metres per second cu ft s depending on the head available the greater the head the less water needed to reach full power three gorges uses francis turbines the turbine diameter is m vgs design alstom s design and the rotation speed is revolutions per minute this means that in order to generate power at hz the generator rotors have poles rated power is mva with a maximum of mva and a power factor of the generator produces electrical power at kv the electricity generated is then stepped up to kv for transmission at hz the outer diameter of the generator stator is m the inner diameter is m the stator the biggest of its kind is m in height bearing load is tonnes average efficiency is over and reaches the generators were manufactured by two joint ventures one of them alstom abb kvaerner and the chinese company harbin motor the other voith general electric siemens abbreviated as vgs and the chinese company oriental motor the technology transfer agreement was signed together with the contract most of the generators are water cooled some newer ones are air cooled which are simpler in design and manufacture and are easier to maintain the first north side main generator no started on july the north side became completely operational september with the implementation of generator no full power mw was only reached on october after the water level reached m the south side main generators are also in operation no began operation on june and no started up on october the sixth no began operation on december raising capacity to gw finally surpassing itaipu dam gw to become the world s largest hydro power plant by capacity as of may when the last main generator no finished its final test the six underground main generators are also in operation raising capacity to gw after nine years of construction installation and testing the power plant was fully operational by july by august the plant had generated twh of electricity in july it generated twh of electricity its first month over twh on june after the river flow rate increased to over m s all generators were switched on producing only mw because the head available during flood season is insufficient during an august flood the plant first reached its maximum output for a short period during the november to may dry season power output is limited by the river s flow rate as seen in the diagrams on the right when there is enough flow power output is limited by plant generating capacity the maximum power output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site assuming the water level is m and the plant gross efficiency is the actual power output in was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid the three gorges dam reached its design maximum reservoir water level of m ft for the first time on october in which the intended annual power generation capacity of twh was realized it has a combined generating capacity of gigawatts and a designed annual generation capacity of billion kilowatt hours in the dam s generating units generated a record twh of electricity which accounts for of china s total hydro generation between first year with all generating units operating and the dam generated an average of twh of electricity per year higher than itaipu dam s average of twh of electricity per year during the same period due to extensive monsoon of year with heavy rainfalls the annual production reached twh that year which broke the previous world record of annual production by itaipu dam equal to twh of year the state grid corporation and china southern power grid paid a flat rate of per mwh us until july since then the price has varied by province from per mwh higher paying customers such as shanghai receive priority nine provinces and two cities consume power from the dam power distribution and transmission infrastructure cost about billion yuan construction was completed in december one year ahead of schedule power is distributed over multiple kv transmission lines three direct current dc lines to the east china grid carry mw three gorges shanghai mw hvdc three gorges changzhou mw and hvdc gezhouba shanghai mw the alternating current ac lines to the central china grid have a total capacity of mw the dc transmission line hvdc three gorges guangdong to the south china grid has a capacity of mw the dam was expected to provide of china s power however electricity demand has increased more quickly than previously projected even fully operational on average it supports only about of electricity demand in china in the year of when the chinese electricity demand reached twh according to the national development and reform commission grams of coal would produce kwh of electricity during from to power production equaled that of million tonnes of standard coal two hazards are uniquely identified with the dam one is that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon and the other is that the dam sits on a seismic fault at current levels of the land in the area is experiencing erosion depositing about million tons of sediment into the yangtze annually because the flow is slower above the dam much of this sediment will now settle there instead of flowing downstream and there will be less sediment downstream the absence of silt downstream has three effects erosion in the reservoir induced by rising water causes frequent major landslides that have led to noticeable disturbance in the reservoir surface including two incidents in may when somewhere between and cubic metres and cu yd of material plunged into the flooded wuxia gorge of the wu river in the first four months of there were significant landslides the dam catalyzed improved upstream wastewater treatment around chongqing and its suburban areas according to the ministry of environmental protection as of april more than new plants could treat million tonnes per day of the total need about landfills were added which could handle tonnes of solid waste every day over one billion tons of wastewater are released annually into the river which was more likely to be swept away before the reservoir was created this has left the water looking stagnant polluted and murky in the three gorges area had forestation down from in the s research by the united nations food and agriculture organization suggested that the asia pacific region would overall gain about km sq mi of forest by that is a significant change from the km sq mi net loss of forest each year in the s this is largely due to china s large reforestation effort this accelerated after the yangtze river floods convinced the government that it should restore tree cover especially in the yangtze s basin upstream of the three gorges dam concerns about the potential wildlife impact of the dam predate the national people s congress s approval in this region has long been known for its rich biodiversity it is home to species of plants which belong to families and genera of these plant species percent are endangered these rare species are also used as ingredients in traditional chinese medicines already the percentage of forested area in the region surrounding the three gorges dam has dropped from twenty percent in to less than ten percent as of negatively affecting all plant species in this locality the region also provides habitats to hundreds of freshwater and terrestrial animal species freshwater fish are especially affected by dams due to changes in the water temperature and flow regime many other fish are injured in the turbine blades of the hydroelectric plants as well this is particularly detrimental to the ecosystem of the region because the yangtze river basin is home to different fish species and accounts for percent of all endangered freshwater fish species in china other aquatic species have been endangered by the dam particularly the baiji or chinese river dolphin now extinct in fact chinese government scholars even claim that the three gorges dam directly caused the extinction of the baiji the chinese paddlefish is also extinct in part due to the dam blocking its migration of the to remaining critically endangered siberian crane a large number currently spend the winter in wetlands that will be destroyed by the three gorges dam the dam contributed to the functional extinction of the baiji yangtze river dolphin though it was close to this level even at the start of construction the dam further decreased its habitat and increased ship travel which are among the factors causing what will be its ultimate demise in addition populations of the yangtze sturgeon are guaranteed to be negatively affected by the dam in nasa scientists calculated that the shift of water mass stored by the dams would increase the total length of the earth s day by microseconds and make the earth slightly more round in the middle and flat on the poles a study published in in the journal open geosciences suggests that the change of reservoir water level affects the gravity field in western sichuan which in turn affects the seismicity in that area an important function of the dam is to control flooding which is a major problem for the seasonal river of the yangtze millions of people live downstream of the dam with many large important cities like wuhan nanjing and shanghai located adjacent to the river plenty of farm land and china s most important industrial area are built beside the river the reservoir s flood storage capacity is km cu mi million acre ft this capacity will reduce the frequency of major downstream flooding from once every years to once every years the dam is expected to minimize the effect of even a super flood in the river flooded km sq mi killing people and forcing people to move the flood covered wuhan a city of eight million people for over three months and the jingguang railway was out of service for more than days the flood carried cubic kilometres cu mi of water the dam could only divert the water above chenglingji leaving to km to cu mi to be diverted also the dam cannot protect against some of the large tributaries downstream including the xiang zishui yuanshui lishui hanshui and the gan in a flood in the same area caused billions of dollars in damage km sq mi of farmland were flooded the flood affected more than million people killing in early august the largest flood in five years passed through the dam site the dam limited the water flow to less than m s million cu ft s per second raising the upstream water level from m ft on august to m ft on august a full km cu mi of flood water was captured and the river flow was cut by as much as m cu ft per second the dam discharges its reservoir during the dry season between december and march every year this increases the flow rate of the river downstream and provides fresh water for agricultural and industrial usage it also improves shipping conditions the water level upstream drops from to m to ft preparing for the rainy season the water also powers the gezhouba dam downstream since the filling of the reservoir in the three gorges dam has supplied an extra km cu mi of fresh water to downstream cities and farms during the dry season during the south china floods in july inflows at the three gorges dam reached a peak of m s million cu ft s exceeding the peak during the yangtze river floods the dam s reservoir rose nearly m ft in hours and reduced the outflow to m s million cu ft s in discharges downstream effectively alleviating serious impacts on the middle and lower river the installation of ship locks is intended to increase river shipping from ten million to million tonnes annually as a result transportation costs will be cut between and shipping will become safer since the gorges are notoriously dangerous to navigate there are two series of ship locks installed near the dam n e n e each of them is made up of five stages with transit time at around four hours maximum vessel size is tons the locks are m long m wide and m deep ft that is m ft longer than those on the st lawrence seaway but half as deep before the dam was constructed the maximum freight capacity at the three gorges site was million tonnes per year from to a total of million tonnes of freight passed through the locks the freight capacity of the river increased six times and the cost of shipping was reduced by the total capacity of the ship locks is expected to reach million tonnes per year these locks are staircase locks whereby inner lock gate pairs serve as both the upper gate and lower gate the gates are the vulnerable hinged type which if damaged could temporarily render the entire flight unusable as there are separate sets of locks for upstream and downstream traffic this system is more water efficient than bi directional staircase locks in addition to the canal locks there is a ship lift a kind of elevator for vessels the ship lift can lift ships of up to tons the vertical distance traveled is m ft and the size of the ship lift s basin is m m m ft ft ft the ship lift takes to minutes to transit as opposed to the three to four hours for stepping through the locks one complicating factor is that the water level can vary dramatically the ship lift must work even if water levels vary by m ft on the lower side and m ft on the upper side the ship lift s design uses a helical gear system to climb or descend a toothed rack the ship lift was not yet complete when the rest of the project was officially opened on may in november it was reported in the local media that construction of the ship lift started in october in february xinhua reported that the four towers that are to support the ship lift had almost been completed the report said the towers had reached m ft of the anticipated m ft the towers would be completed by june and the entire shiplift in as of may the ship lift was expected to be completed by july it was tested in december and announced complete in january lahmeyer the german firm that designed the ship lift said it will take a vessel less than an hour to transit the lift an article in steel construction says the actual time of the lift will be minutes it says that the expected dimensions of the t million kg passenger vessels the ship lift s basin was designed to carry will be by by metres ft ft ft the moving mass including counterweights is tonnes the trials of elevator finished in july the first cargo ship was lifted on july the lift time comprised minutes shanghai daily reported that the first operational use of the lift was on september when limited operational testing of the lift began plans also exist for the construction of short portage railways bypassing the dam area altogether two short rail lines one on each side of the river are to be constructed the kilometre long mi northern portage railway will run from the taipingxi port facility on the northern side of the yangtze just upstream from the dam via yichang east railway station to the baiyang tianjiahe port facility in baiyang town below yichang the kilometre long mi southern portage railway will run from maoping upstream of the dam via yichang south railway station to zhicheng on the jiaozuo liuzhou railway in late preliminary work started along both future railway routes though the large size of the reservoir caused huge relocation upstream it was considered justified by the flood protection it provides for communities downstream as of june china relocated million residents ending with gaoyang in hubei province as cities towns and villages either flooded or were partially flooded by the reservoir about of the province s million and chongqing municipality s million population about residents were relocated to other provinces relocation was completed on july some reports claimed that chongqing municipality will encourage an additional four million people to move away from the dam to the main urban area of chongqing by however the municipal government explained that the relocation is due to urbanization rather than the dam and people involved included other areas of the municipality the kilometre long mi reservoir flooded some archaeological sites and altered the appearance of the three gorges as the water level rose over m ft cultural and historical relics are being moved to higher ground as they are discovered but the flooding inevitably covered undiscovered relics some sites could not be moved because of their location size or design such as the hanging coffins site high in the shen nong gorge is part of the cliffs the ancient cities of guizhou kuizhou and wushan were also completely submerged the united states department of defense reported that in taiwan proponents of strikes against the mainland apparently hope that merely presenting credible threats to china s urban population or high value targets such as the three gorges dam will deter chinese military coercion destroying the three gorges dam has been a tactic discussed and debated in taiwan since the early s when the dam was still in the planning phase the notion that the military in taiwan would seek to destroy the dam provoked an angry response from the mainland chinese media people s liberation army general liu yuan was quoted in the china youth daily saying that the people s republic of china would be seriously on guard against threats from taiwan independence terrorists the three gorges dam is a steel concrete gravity dam the water is held back by the innate mass of the individual dam sections as a result damage to an individual section should not affect other parts of the dam zhang boting deputy secretary general of china society for hydropower engineering suggested that concrete gravity dams are resistant to nuclear strikes sung chao wen former taiwanese ministry of defense advisor called the notion of using cruise missiles to destroy the three gorges dam ridiculous he cited missiles would only deliver minimal damage to the reinforced concrete and any attack attempts would need to go through multiple layers of ground and air defenses immediately after the first filling of the reservoir around hairline cracks were observed in the dam s structure however an experts group gave the project overall a good quality rating and the concrete units all passed quality testing with normal deformation within design limits in order to maximize the utility of the three gorges dam and cut down on sedimentation from the jinsha river the upper course of the yangtze river authorities plan to build a series of dams on the jinsha including wudongde dam baihetan dam along with the now completed xiluodu and xiangjiaba dams the total capacity of those four dams is mw almost double the capacity of the three gorges baihetan is under construction and should be fully operational by july wudongde was opened in june another eight dams are in the midstream of the jinsha and eight more upstream of it

 notre dame de paris french n t dam d pa i listen meaning our lady of paris referred to simply as notre dame a is a medieval catholic cathedral on the le de la cit an island in the seine river in the th arrondissement of paris the cathedral dedicated to the virgin mary is considered one of the finest examples of french gothic architecture several of its attributes set it apart from the earlier romanesque style particularly its pioneering use of the rib vault and flying buttress its enormous and colourful rose windows and the naturalism and abundance of its sculptural decoration notre dame also stands out for its musical components notably its three pipe organs one of which is historic and its immense church bells construction of the cathedral began in under bishop maurice de sully and was largely completed by though it was modified frequently in the centuries that followed in the s during the french revolution notre dame suffered extensive desecration much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed in the th century the coronation of napoleon i and the funerals of many of the french republic s presidents took place at the cathedral the publication of victor hugo s novel notre dame de paris known in english as the hunchback of notre dame inspired popular interest in the cathedral which led to a major restoration project between and supervised by eug ne viollet le duc on august the liberation of paris from german occupation was celebrated in notre dame with the singing of the magnificat beginning in the cathedral s fa ade was cleaned of centuries of soot and grime another cleaning and restoration project was carried out between and the cathedral is one of the most widely recognized symbols of the city of paris and the french nation in it was awarded the honorary status of a minor basilica as the cathedral of the archdiocese of paris notre dame contains the cathedra of the archbishop of paris laurent ulrich in the early st century approximately million people visited notre dame annually making it the most visited monument in paris the cathedral has long been renowned for its lent sermons a tradition founded in the s by the dominican jean baptiste henri lacordaire in recent years these sermons have increasingly often been given by leading public figures or government employed academics over time the cathedral has gradually been stripped of many of its original decorations and artworks however the cathedral still contains several noteworthy examples of gothic baroque and th century sculptures a number of th and early th century altarpieces and some of the most important relics in christendom including the crown of thorns a sliver of the true cross and a nail from the true cross on april while notre dame was undergoing renovation and restoration its roof caught fire and burned for about hours the cathedral sustained serious damage as a result the fl che the timber spirelet over the crossing was destroyed as was most of the lead covered wooden roof above the stone vaulted ceiling this resulted in contamination of the site and the nearby environment with lead after the fire many of the proposals for restoration suggested modernizing the cathedral s design but the french national assembly rejected this approach enacting a law on july that required the restoration to preserve the cathedral s historic artistic and architectural interest the task of stabilizing the building against possible collapse was completed in november and reconstruction began in the government of france has said it hopes the reconstruction can be completed by spring in time for the opening of the summer olympics in paris president emmanuel macron confirmed on april that the cathedral site will be formally returned to the church on april and that the first mass since the fire will be held in the cathedral nave on that day even if the reconstruction has not been finished by then full citation needed it is believed that before the arrival of christianity in france a gallo roman temple dedicated to jupiter stood on the site of notre dame evidence for this includes the pillar of the boatmen discovered beneath the cathedral in in the th or th century a large early christian church the cathedral of saint tienne was built on the site close to the royal palace the entrance was situated about metres ft west of the present west front of notre dame and the apse was located about where the west fa ade is today it was roughly half the size of the later notre dame metres ft long and separated into nave and four aisles by marble columns then decorated with mosaics the last church before the cathedral of notre dame was a romanesque remodeling of saint tienne that although enlarged and remodeled was found to be unfit for the growing population of paris b a baptistery the church of saint john le rond built about was located on the north side of the west front of notre dame until the work of jacques germain soufflot in the th century in the bishop of paris maurice de sully decided to build a new and much larger church he summarily demolished the earlier cathedral and chose to recycle its materials sully decided that the new church should be built in the gothic style which had been inaugurated at the royal abbey of saint denis in the late s the chronicler jean de saint victor fr recorded in the memorial historiarum that the construction of notre dame began between march and april with the laying of the cornerstone in the presence of king louis vii and pope alexander iii four phases of construction took place under bishops maurice de sully and eudes de sully not related to maurice according to masters whose names have been lost analysis of vault stones that fell in the fire shows that they were quarried in vexin a county northwest of paris and presumably brought up the seine by ferry the first phase began with the construction of the choir and its two ambulatories according to robert of torigni the choir was completed in and the high altar consecrated on may by cardinal henri de ch teau mar ay the papal legate in paris and maurice de sully failed verification the second phase from to concerned the construction of the four sections of the nave behind the choir and its aisles to the height of the clerestories it began after the completion of the choir but ended before the final allotted section of the nave was finished beginning in the bases of the fa ade were put in place and the first traverses were completed heraclius of caesarea called for the third crusade in from the still incomplete cathedral louis ix deposited the relics of the passion of christ which included the crown of thorns a nail from the cross and a sliver of the cross which he had purchased at great expense from the latin emperor baldwin ii in the cathedral during the construction of the sainte chapelle an under shirt believed to have belonged to louis was added to the collection of relics at some time after his death the decision was made to add transepts at the choir where the altar was located in order to bring more light into the centre of the church the use of simpler four part rather than six part rib vaults meant that the roofs were stronger and could be higher after bishop maurice de sully s death in his successor eudes de sully oversaw the completion of the transepts and continued work on the nave which was nearing completion at the time of his own death in by this time the western fa ade was already largely built though it was not completed until around the mid s between and the upper gallery of the nave was constructed along with the two towers on the west fa ade another significant change came in the mid th century when the transepts were remodelled in the latest rayonnant style in the late s jean de chelles added a gabled portal to the north transept topped off by a spectacular rose window shortly afterward from pierre de montreuil executed a similar scheme on the southern transept both these transept portals were richly embellished with sculpture the south portal features scenes from the lives of saint stephen and of various local saints while the north portal featured the infancy of christ and the story of theophilus in the tympanum with a highly influential statue of the virgin and child in the trumeau master builders pierre de chelles jean ravy fr jean le bouteiller and raymond du temple fr succeeded de chelles and de montreuil and then each other in the construction of the cathedral ravy completed de chelles s rood screen and chevet chapels then began the metre ft flying buttresses of the choir jean le bouteiller ravy s nephew succeeded him in and was himself replaced on his death in by his deputy raymond du temple philip the fair opened the first estates general in the cathedral in an important innovation in the th century was the introduction of the flying buttress before the buttresses all of the weight of the roof pressed outward and down to the walls and the abutments supporting them with the flying buttress the weight was carried by the ribs of the vault entirely outside the structure to a series of counter supports which were topped with stone pinnacles which gave them greater weight the buttresses meant that the walls could be higher and thinner and could have much larger windows the date of the first buttresses is not known with any great precision beyond an installation date in the th century art historian andrew tallon however has argued based on detailed laser scans of the entire structure that the buttresses were part of the original design according to tallon the scans indicate that the upper part of the building has not moved one smidgen in years whereas if they were added later some movement from prior to their addition would be expected tallon thus concluded that flying buttresses were present from the outset the first buttresses were replaced by larger and stronger ones in the th century these had a reach of fifteen metres between the walls and counter supports plan of the cathedral made by eug ne viollet le duc in the th century portals and nave to the left a choir in the center and apse and ambulatory to the right the annex to the south is the sacristy early six part rib vaults of the nave the ribs transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof downward and outwards to the pillars and the supporting buttresses the massive buttresses which counter the outward thrust from the rib vaults of the nave the weight of the building shaped pinnacles helps keep the line of thrust safely within the buttresses later flying buttresses of the apse of notre dame th century reached metres from the wall to the counter supports john of jandun recognized the cathedral as one of paris s three most important buildings prominent structures in his treatise on the praises of paris that most glorious church of the most glorious virgin mary mother of god deservedly shines out like the sun among stars and although some speakers by their own free judgment because they are able to see only a few things easily may say that some other is more beautiful i believe however respectfully that if they attend more diligently to the whole and the parts they will quickly retract this opinion where indeed i ask would they find two towers of such magnificence and perfection so high so large so strong clothed round about with such multiple varieties of ornaments where i ask would they find such a multipartite arrangement of so many lateral vaults above and below where i ask would they find such light filled amenities as the many surrounding chapels furthermore let them tell me in what church i may see such a large cross of which one arm separates the choir from the nave finally i would willingly learn where there are two such circles situated opposite each other in a straight line which on account of their appearance are given the name of the fourth vowel o among which smaller orbs and circles with wondrous artifice so that some arranged circularly others angularly surround windows ruddy with precious colours and beautiful with the most subtle figures of the pictures in fact i believe that this church offers the carefully discerning such cause for admiration that its inspection can scarcely sate the soul on december the boy king henry vi of england was crowned king of france in notre dame aged ten the traditional coronation church of reims cathedral being under french control during the renaissance the gothic style fell out of style and the internal pillars and walls of notre dame were covered with tapestries in rioting huguenots damaged some of the statues of notre dame considering them idolatrous the fountain fr in notre dame s parvis was added in to provide nearby parisians with running water king louis xiv on the insistence of his father louis xiii decided in to make extensive modifications to notre dame he tasked robert de cotte with the renovation cotte replaced the rood screen with a sumptuous and gilded wrought iron fence opened up the choir and ambulatory and removed the tombs in the nave new furniture was produced as well as the current high altar depicting louis xiv and louis xiii kneeling before a piet citation needed since the parisian goldsmith guild had made regular donations to the cathedral chapter in it was decided that the guild would donate a large altarpiece every year on the first of may these works came to be known as the grands mays the subject matter was restricted to episodes from the acts of the apostles the prestigious commission was awarded to the most prominent painters and after members of the acad mie royale seventy six paintings had been donated by when the custom was discontinued for financial reasons those works were confiscated in and the majority were subsequently dispersed among regional museums in france those that remained in the cathedral were removed or relocated within the building by the th century restorers thirteen of the grands mays remain in n tre dame these paintings suffered water damage during the fire of and were removed for conservation an altarpiece depicting the visitation painted by jean jouvenet in was also located in the cathedral the canon antoine de la porte commissioned for louis xiv six paintings depicting the life of the virgin mary for the choir at this same time charles de la fosse painted his adoration of the magi now in the louvre louis antoine de noailles archbishop of paris extensively modified the roof of notre dame in renovating its framing and removing the gargoyles with lead gutters noailles also strengthened the buttresses galleries terraces and vaults in the cathedral s canons decided that its interior was too dark the medieval stained glass windows except the rosettes were removed and replaced with plain white glass panes finally jacques germain soufflot was tasked with the modification of the portals at the front of the cathedral to allow processions to more easily enter it after the french revolution in notre dame and the rest of the church s property in france was seized and made public property the cathedral was rededicated in to the cult of reason and then to the cult of the supreme being in during this time many of the treasures of the cathedral were either destroyed or plundered the twenty eight statues of biblical kings located at the west fa ade mistaken for statues of french kings were beheaded many of the heads were found during a excavation nearby and are on display at the mus e de cluny for a time the goddess of liberty replaced the virgin mary on several altars the cathedral s great bells escaped being melted down all of the other large statues on the fa ade with the exception of the statue of the virgin mary on the portal of the cloister were destroyed the cathedral came to be used as a warehouse for the storage of food and other non religious purposes with the concordat of napoleon bonaparte restored notre dame to the catholic church though this was only finalized on april napoleon also named paris s new bishop jean baptiste de belloy who restored the cathedral s interior charles percier and pierre fran ois l onard fontaine made quasi gothic modifications to notre dame for the coronation of napoleon as emperor of the french within the cathedral the building s exterior was whitewashed and the interior decorated in neoclassical then in vogue in the decades after the napoleonic wars notre dame fell into such a state of disrepair that paris officials considered its demolition victor hugo who admired the cathedral wrote the novel notre dame de paris published in english as the hunchback of notre dame in to save notre dame the book was an enormous success raising awareness of the cathedral s decaying state the same year as hugo s novel was published however anti legitimists plundered notre dame s sacristy in king louis philippe ordered that the church be restored the architect who had hitherto been in charge of notre dame s maintenance tienne hippolyte godde was dismissed in his stead jean baptiste lassus and eug ne viollet le duc who had distinguished themselves with the restoration of the nearby sainte chapelle were appointed in the next year viollet le duc submitted a budget of francs which was reduced to francs for the restoration of notre dame and the construction of a new sacristy building this budget was exhausted in and work stopped as viollet le duc made proposals for more money in totality the restoration cost over million francs when lassus died in viollet le duc was left sole architect of the project until its completion on may citation needed supervising a large team of sculptors glass makers and other craftsmen and working from drawings or engravings viollet le duc remade or added decorations if he felt they were in the spirit of the original style one of the latter items was a taller and more ornate spire to replace the original th century spire which had been removed in the decoration of the restoration included a statue of saint thomas that resembles viollet le duc as well as the sculpture of mythical creatures on the galerie des chim res the construction of the sacristy was especially financially costly to secure a firm foundation it was necessary for viollet le duc s labourers to dig metres ft master glassworkers meticulously copied styles of the th century as written about by art historians antoine lusson and adolphe napol on didron during the paris commune of march may the cathedral and other churches were closed down and some two hundred priests and the archbishop of paris were taken as hostages in may during the semaine sanglante of bloody week as the army recaptured the city the communards targeted the cathedral along with the tuileries palace and other landmarks for destruction the communards piled the furniture together in order to burn the cathedral the arson was halted when the communard government realised that the fire would also destroy the neighbouring h tel dieu hospital filled with hundreds of patients during the liberation of paris in august the cathedral suffered some minor damage from stray bullets some of the medieval glass was damaged and was replaced by glass with modern abstract designs on august a special mass was held in the cathedral to celebrate the liberation of paris from the germans it was attended by general charles de gaulle and general philippe leclerc in on the initiative of culture minister andr malraux and to mark the th anniversary of the cathedral the fa ade was cleaned of the centuries of soot and grime restoring it to its original off white colour on january vandals placed a north vietnamese flag atop a spire of the notre dame and sabotaged the stairway leading to it the flag was cut from the spire by paris fire brigade sergeant raymond belle in a daring helicopter mission the first of its kind in france the requiem mass of charles de gaulle was held in notre dame on november the next year on june philippe petit walked across a tight rope strung up between notre dame s two bell towers and entertained spectators after the magnificat of may pope john paul ii celebrated mass on the parvis of the cathedral the requiem mass of fran ois mitterrand was held at the cathedral as with past french heads of state on january the stone masonry of the cathedral s exterior had deteriorated in the th and th century due to increased air pollution in paris which accelerated erosion of decorations and discoloured the stone by the late s several gargoyles and turrets had also fallen off or become too loose to remain in place a decade long renovation programme began in and replaced much of the exterior with care given to retain the authentic architectural elements of the cathedral including rigorous inspection of new limestone blocks a discreet system of electrical wires not visible from below was also installed on the roof to deter pigeons the cathedral s pipe organ was upgraded with a computerized system to control the mechanical connections to the pipes the west face was cleaned and restored in time for millennium celebrations in december the requiem mass of cardinal jean marie lustiger former archbishop of paris and jewish convert to catholicism was held in notre dame on august the set of four th century bells atop the northern towers at notre dame were melted down and recast into new bronze bells in to celebrate the building s th anniversary they were designed to recreate the sound of the cathedral s original bells from the th century despite the s renovation the cathedral had continued to show signs of deterioration that prompted the national government to propose a new renovation program in the late s the entire renovation was estimated to cost million which the archbishop of paris planned to raise through funds from the national government and private donations a million renovation of the cathedral s spire began in late and continued into the following year requiring the temporary removal of copper statues on the roof and other decorative elements days before the april fire notre dame began a year long celebration of the th anniversary of the laying of the first building block for the cathedral on december during that anniversary year on may dominique venner a historian and white nationalist placed a letter on the church altar and shot himself dying instantly around visitors were evacuated from the cathedral french police arrested two people on september after a car containing seven gas canisters was found near notre dame on february french police arrested four persons in montpellier already known by authorities to have ties to radical islamist organizations on charges of plotting to travel to paris and attack the cathedral later that year on june visitors were shut inside notre dame cathedral in paris after a man with a hammer attacked a police officer outside on april the cathedral caught fire destroying the spire and the forest of oak roof beams supporting the lead roof it was speculated that the fire was linked to ongoing renovation work according to later studies the fire broke out in the attic of the cathedral at the smoke detectors immediately signaled the fire to a cathedral employee who did not summon the fire brigade but instead sent a cathedral guard to investigate instead of going to the correct attic the guard was sent to the wrong location to the attic of the adjoining sacristy and reported there was no fire the guard telephoned his supervisor who did not immediately answer about fifteen minutes later the error was discovered whereupon the guard s supervisor told him to go to the correct location the fire brigade was still not notified by the time the guard had climbed the three hundred steps to the cathedral attic the fire was well advanced the alarm system was not designed to automatically notify the fire brigade which was finally summoned at after the guard had returned from the attic and reported a now raging fire and more than half an hour after the fire alarm had begun sounding firefighters arrived in less than ten minutes the spire of the cathedral collapsed at bringing down some tonnes of stone and lead the firefighters inside were ordered back down by this time the fire had spread to the north tower where the eight bells were located the firefighters concentrated their efforts in the tower they feared that if the bells fell they could wreck the tower and endanger the structure of the other tower and the whole cathedral they had to ascend a stairway threatened by fire and to contend with low water pressure for their hoses as other firefighters watered the stairway and the roof a team of twenty climbed up the narrow stairway of the south tower crossed to the north tower lowered hoses to be connected to fire engines outside the cathedral and sprayed water on the fire beneath the bells by they were finally able to bring the fire under control the main structure was intact firefighters saved the fa ade towers walls buttresses and stained glass windows the great organ which has over pipes and was built by fran ois thierry in the th century was also saved but sustained water damage because of the ongoing renovation the copper statues on the spire had been removed before the fire the stone vaulting that forms the ceiling of the cathedral had several holes but was otherwise intact since france s cathedrals including notre dame have been owned by the state which is self insured some costs might be recovered through insurance coverage if the fire is found to have been caused by contractors working on the site the french insurer axa provided insurance coverage for two of the contracting firms working on notre dame s restoration before the blaze axa also provided insurance coverage for some of the relics and artworks in the cathedral president emmanuel macron said approximately firefighters helped to battle the fire one firefighter was seriously injured and two police officers were hurt during the blaze an ornate tapestry woven in the early s is going on public display for only the third time in recent decades the decoration was rescued from notre dame de paris cathedral after the fire for the first time in more than years the christmas mass was not hosted at the cathedral on december due to the ongoing restoration work after the fire eight members of the cathedral choir a number limited by covid pandemic restrictions performed inside the building for the first time since the fire in december a video of the event aired later just before midnight on december immediately after the fire president macron promised that notre dame would be restored and called for the work to be completed within five years an international architectural competition was also announced to redesign the spire and roof the hasty spire competition announcement drew immediate criticism in the international press from heritage academics and professionals who faulted the french government for being too narrowly focused on quickly building a new spire and neglecting to frame its response more holistically as an inclusive social process encompassing the whole building and its long term users a new law was immediately drafted to make notre dame exempt from existing heritage laws and procedures which prompted an open letter to president macron signed by over heritage experts urging respect for existing regulations the law which passed on may was hotly debated in the french national assembly with opponents accusing macron s administration of using notre dame self servingly for political grandstanding and defenders arguing the need for expediency and tax breaks to encourage philanthropic giving president macron suggested he was open to a contemporary architectural gesture even before the competition rules were announced architects around the world offered suggestions the proposals included a meter spire made of carbon fibre covered with gold leaf a roof built of stained glass a greenhouse a garden with trees open to the sky and a column of light pointed upwards a poll published in the french newspaper le figaro on may showed that of french respondents wanted a spire identical to the original french culture minister franck riester promised that the restoration will not be hasty on july the french national assembly enacted a law requiring that the restoration must preserve the historic artistic and architectural interest of the monument in october the french government announced that the first stage of reconstruction the stabilising of the structure against collapse would take until the end of reconstruction could not begin before early president macron announced that he hoped the reconstructed cathedral could be finished by spring in time for the opening of the summer olympics in december monseigneur patrick chauvet the rector of the cathedral said there was still a chance that notre dame cannot be saved due to the risk of the remaining scaffolding falling onto the three damaged vaults the first task of the restoration was the removal of tonnes of melted metal tubes the remains of the scaffolding which remained on the top after the fire and could have fallen onto the vaults and caused further structural damage this stage began in february and continued through april a large crane eighty four metres high was put in place next to the cathedral to help remove the scaffolding later wooden support beams were added to stabilise the flying buttresses and other structures on april the archbishop of paris michel aupetit and a handful of participants all in protective clothing to prevent exposure to lead dust performed a good friday service inside the cathedral music was provided by the violinist renaud capu on the lectors were the actors philippe torreton and judith chemla chemla gave an a cappella rendition of ave maria a new phase of the restoration commenced on june two teams of workers began descending into the roof to remove the tangle of tubes of the old scaffolding melted by the fire the workers used saws to cut up the forty thousand pieces of scaffolding weighing altogether two hundred tons which was carefully lifted out of the roof by an eighty meter tall crane the phase was completed in november in february the selection of oak trees to replace the spire and roof timbers destroyed by the fire began as many as a thousand mature trees will be chosen from the forests of france each of a diameter of to centimetres to and a height of eight to fourteen meters to and an age of several hundred years once cut the trees must dry for twelve to eighteen months the trees will be replaced by new plantings two years after the fire a great deal of work had been completed but a news report stated that there is still a hole on top of the church they re also building a replica of the church s spire more oak trees needed to be shipped to paris where they would need to be dried before use they will be essential in completing the restoration on september the public agency overseeing the cathedral stated that the safety work was completed and the cathedral was now fully secured and that reconstruction would begin within a few months in a preventive dig carried out between february and april before the construction of a scaffold for reconstructing the cathedral s spire unearthed several statues and tombs under the cathedral one of the discoveries included a th century lead sarcophagus that was found feet below where the transept crosses the church s th century nave on april france s national archaeological research institute inrap announced that the sarcophagus was extracted from the cathedral and that scientists have already peeked into the casket using an endoscopic camera revealing the upper part of a skeleton another significant discovery was an opening below the cathedral floor likely made around when the gothic cathedral was first under construction inside were fragments of a choir screen dating from the th century that had been destroyed in the early th century towers on west fa ade the gallery of chimeras pictured in by georges redon the th century spire the rooster reliquary atop the spire it was found lightly damaged in the rubble after the fire the spire from above in statue of thomas the apostle with the features of restorer eug ne viollet le duc at the base of the spire the two towers are metres ft high and were the tallest structures in paris until the completion of the eiffel tower in the towers were the last major element of the cathedral to be constructed the south tower was built first between and and the north tower between and the newer north tower is slightly larger as can be seen when they are viewed from directly in front of the church the contrefort or buttress of the north tower is also larger the south tower was accessible to visitors by a stairway whose entrance was on the south side of the tower the stairway has steps and has a stop at the gothic hall at the level of the rose window where visitors could look over the parvis and see a collection of paintings and sculpture from earlier periods of the cathedral s history the fourteen bells of the cathedral are located in the north and south towers see bells below a lead roofed water reservoir between the two towers behind the colonnade and the gallery and before the nave and the pignon gable provides water for firefighting citation needed the cathedral s fl che or spire was located over the transept the original spire was constructed in the th century probably between and it was battered weakened and bent by the wind over five centuries and finally was removed in during the th century restoration eug ne viollet le duc decided to recreate it making a new version of oak covered with lead the entire spire weighed tonnes following viollet le duc s plans the spire was surrounded by copper statues of the twelve apostles a group of three at each point of the compass in front of each group is a symbol representing one of the four evangelists a winged ox for saint luke a lion for saint mark an eagle for saint john and an angel for saint matthew just days prior to the fire the statues were removed for restoration while in place they had faced outwards towards paris except one the statue of saint thomas the patron saint of architects faced the spire and had the features of viollet le duc the rooster weathervane atop the spire contained three relics a tiny piece from the crown of thorns in the cathedral treasury and relics of saint denis and saint genevieve patron saints of paris they were placed there in by archbishop jean verdier to protect the congregation from lightning or other harm the rooster with relics intact was recovered in the rubble shortly after the fire the gothic cathedral was a liber pauperum a poor people s book covered with sculptures vividly illustrating biblical stories for the vast majority of parishioners who were illiterate to add to the effect all of the sculpture on the fa ades was originally painted and gilded illustration of the last judgment central portal of west fa ade the martyr saint denis holding his head over the portal of the virgin the serpent tempts adam and eve part of the last judgment on the central portal of west fa ade archangel michael and satan weighing souls during the last judgment central portal west fa ade a strix on the west fa ade gargoyles were the rainspouts of the cathedral chimera on the fa ade allegory of alchemy central portal the tympanum over the central portal on the west fa ade facing the square vividly illustrates the last judgment with figures of sinners being led off to hell and good christians taken to heaven the sculpture of the right portal shows the coronation of the virgin mary and the left portal shows the lives of saints who were important to parisians particularly saint anne the mother of the virgin mary the exteriors of cathedrals and other gothic churches were also decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening grotesques or monsters these included the gargoyle the chimera a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat and the strix or stryge a creature resembling an owl or bat which was said to eat human flesh the strix appeared in classical roman literature it was described by the roman poet ovid who was widely read in the middle ages as a large headed bird with transfixed eyes rapacious beak and greyish white wings they were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshipers symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church the gargoyles which were added in about had a more practical purpose they were the rain spouts of the cathedral designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows where it might erode the mortar binding the stone to produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water a large number of gargoyles were used so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture the rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters then down channels on the flying buttresses then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral amid all the religious figures some of the sculptural decoration was devoted to illustrating medieval science and philosophy the central portal of the west fa ade is decorated with carved figures holding circular plaques with symbols of transformation taken from alchemy the central pillar of the central door of notre dame features a statue of a woman on a throne holding a sceptre in her left hand and in her right hand two books one open symbol of public knowledge and the other closed esoteric knowledge along with a ladder with seven steps symbolizing the seven steps alchemists followed in their scientific quest of trying to transform ordinary metals into gold many of the statues particularly the grotesques were removed from the fa ade in the th and th centuries or were destroyed during the french revolution they were replaced with figures in the gothic style designed by eug ne viollet le duc during the th century restoration the earliest rose window on the west fa ade about the west rose window about north rose window about north rose window including lower vertical windows the stained glass windows of notre dame particularly the three rose windows are among the most famous features of the cathedral the west rose window over the portals was the first and smallest of the roses in notre dame it is metres in diameter and was made in about with the pieces of glass set in a thick circular stone frame none of the original glass remains in this window it was recreated in the th century the two transept windows are larger and contain a greater proportion of glass than the rose on the west fa ade because the new system of buttresses made the nave walls thinner and stronger the north rose was created in about and the south rose in about the south rose in the transept is particularly notable for its size and artistry it is metres in diameter with the claire voie surrounding it a total of metres it was given to the cathedral by king louis ix of france known as saint louis the south rose has medallions arranged in four circles depicting scenes from the life of christ and those who witnessed his time on earth the inner circle has twelve medallions showing the twelve apostles during later restorations some of these original medallions were moved to circles farther out the next two circles depict celebrated martyrs and virgins the fourth circle shows twenty angels as well as saints important to paris notably saint denis margaret the virgin with a dragon and saint eustace the third and fourth circles also have some depictions of old testament subjects the third circle has some medallions with scenes from the new testament gospel of matthew which date from the last quarter of the th century these are the oldest glass in the window additional scenes in the corners around the rose window include jesus descent into hell adam and eve the resurrection of christ saint peter and saint paul are at the bottom of the window and mary magdalene and john the apostle at the top above the rose was a window depicting christ triumphant seated in the sky surrounded by his apostles below are sixteen windows with painted images of prophets these were not part of the original window they were painted during the restoration in the th century by alfred g renthe under the direction of eug ne viollet le duc based upon a similar window at chartres cathedral the south rose had a difficult history in it was damaged by the settling of the masonry walls and not restored until it was seriously damaged in the french revolution of rioters burned the residence of the archbishop next to the cathedral and many of the panes were destroyed the window was entirely rebuilt by viollet le duc in he rotated the window by fifteen degrees to give it a clear vertical and horizontal axis and replaced the destroyed pieces of glass with new glass in the same style the window today contains both medieval and th century glass in the s after three decades of debate it was decided to replace many of the th century grisaille windows in the nave designed by viollet le duc with new windows the new windows made by jacques le chevallier are without human figures and use abstract grisaille designs and colour to try to recreate the luminosity of the cathedral s interior in the th century the massive fire left the three great medieval rose windows essentially intact but with some damage the rector of the cathedral noted that one rose window would have to be dismantled as it was unstable and at risk most of the other damaged windows were of much less historical value unlike some other french cathedrals notre dame was originally constructed without a crypt in the medieval period burials were made directly into the floor of the church or in above ground sarcophagi some with tomb effigies french gisant high ranking clergy and some royals were buried in the choir and apse while many others including lower ranking clergy and lay people were buried in the nave or chapels there is no surviving complete record of all of the burials made at this time in many of the choir tombs were disturbed or covered over during a major renovation project remains which were exhumed were reburied in a common tomb beside the high altar in a small crypt measuring about six meters by six meters x was dug out in the middle of the

chaplains cantors and choirboys between and the cathedral floor was repaved with black and white marble tiles which covered over most of the remaining tombs this prevented many of these tombs from being disturbed during the revolution in the choir crypt was expanded to stretch most of the length of the choir during this project many medieval tombs were rediscovered likewise the nave crypt was also rediscovered in when a larger vault was dug out to install a vault heater many other tombs are also located in the chapels eudes de sully was the first bishop to be burried in notre dame his

or chief organist french titulaires des grandes orgues of the great organ of notre dame is considered one of the most prestigious organist posts in france along with the post of titular organist of saint sulpice in paris cavaill coll s largest instrument after the death of pierre cochereau the cathedral authorities controversially decided to go back to the clicquot practice of having several titulaires and also to guarantee that no one organist would have so much influence over the organ notre dame currently has ten bells the two largest bells emmanuel and marie are mounted in the south tower the eight others gabriel anne genevi ve denis marcel tienne beno t joseph maurice and jean marie are mounted in the north tower in addition to accompanying regular activities at the cathedral the bells have also rung to commemorate events of national and international significance such as the armistice of november the liberation of paris the fall of the berlin wall and the september attacks the bells are made with bronze for its resonance and resistance to corrosion during the medieval period they were often founded on the grounds of the cathedral so they would not need to be transported long distances according to tradition the bishop of paris held a ceremony in which he blessed and baptized the bells and a godparent formally bestowed a name on the bell most of the cathedral s early bells were named after the person who donated them but they were also named after biblical figures saints bishops and others after the baptism the bells were hoisted into the towers through circular openings in the vaulted ceilings and mounted to headstocks to allow the bells to swing notre dame s bells swing on a straight swinging axis meaning the axis of rotation is just above the crown of the bell this style of ringing produces a clearer tone as the clapper strikes the bell on the upswing called a flying clapper however it also causes great horizontal forces which can be up to one and a half times the weight of the bell for this reason the bells are mounted within wooden belfries which are recessed from the towers stone walls these absorb the horizontal forces and prevent the bells from damaging the relatively brittle stonework the current belfries date to the th century restoration before the revolution it was common for the bells to break and they were often removed for repairs or to be entirely recast and sometimes renamed the bell guillaume for example was renamed three times and recast no less than five times between and the practice of bell ringing at notre dame is recorded as early as by the end of the th century the bells were marking the civil hours and in they began to call to prayer for the angelus three times a day both practices which continue today during the revolution most of the cathedral s bells were removed and melted down while many of them bore the names of the medieval bells most were relatively recent recastings made from most of the same metal during the th century restoration four new bells were made for the north tower these were replaced in with nine as part of the cathedral s th anniversary celebration in addition to the main bells the cathedral has also had smaller secondary bells these included a carillon in the medieval spire three clock bells on the north transept in the th century and six bells added in the th century three in the reconstructed spire and three within the roof to be heard in the sanctuary these were destroyed during the fire circular utility door right of center in the ceiling below the north tower made for raising and lowering bells the bourdon emmanuel notre dame s largest and oldest bell cast in illustration of a bell headstock and mounting components left and notre dame s original south belfry right c illustration by p gard showing the belfry which is present today the four th century bells which were retired in nine new bells exhibited in the nave in february the second bourdon marie mounted in the south belfry the first clocks used at notre dame were clepsydras these were used to tell the hours which were marked by striking bells in the th century notre dame had two clepsydras running simultaneously one in the cloister and one in the church itself a lay chamberlain was responsible to keep the clocks filled with water and to notify a churchwarden when it was time to strike the bells for the hour in guillot de montjoye and jean bernard de vienne canons and stewards of the church fabric donated a mechanical clock to the cathedral the movement was installed in a glass cabinet in the gallery beneath the north rose window and rang three bells placed outside above the north portal between and the clock and bells were moved to the north tower a metres ft in clock face was installed inside the church below the organ platform during viollet le duc s restoration in the th century a new clock was made the collin wagner movement measuring two metres feet across was located in the forest underneath the central spire within a glass enclosed room this controlled four dormer clock faces visible on the transept roofs two on each side this clock was destroyed by the fire shortly after the fire french clockmaker jean baptiste vior discovered an almost identical collin wagner movement in storage at sainte trinit church in northern paris olivier chandez who had been responsible for the upkeep of notre dame s clock described the find as almost a miracle while the clock cannot simply be installed in notre dame itself it is hoped that the clock can be used to create a new clock for notre dame to the same specifications as the one which was destroyed until the french revolution notre dame was the property of the archbishop of paris and therefore the roman catholic church it was nationalized on november and since then has been the property of the french state under the concordat of use of the cathedral was returned to the church but not ownership legislation from and clarified that cathedrals were maintained at the expense of the french government this was reaffirmed in the law on the separation of church and state designating the catholic church as having the exclusive right to use it for religious purposes in perpetuity notre dame is one of seventy historic churches in france with this status the archdiocese is responsible for paying the employees for security heating and cleaning and for ensuring that the cathedral is open free to visitors the archdiocese does not receive subsidies from the french state th

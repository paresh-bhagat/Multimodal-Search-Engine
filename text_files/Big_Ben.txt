 big ben is the nickname for the great bell of the great clock of westminster at the north end of the palace of westminster in london england and the name is frequently extended to refer also to the clock and the clock tower the official name of the tower in which big ben is located was originally the clock tower but it was renamed elizabeth tower in to mark the diamond jubilee of elizabeth ii the tower was designed by augustus pugin in a neo gothic style when completed in its clock was the largest and most accurate four faced striking and chiming clock in the world the tower stands feet m tall and the climb from ground level to the belfry is steps its base is square measuring feet m on each side dials of the clock are feet m in diameter all four nations of the uk are represented on the tower on shields featuring a rose for england thistle for scotland shamrock for ireland and leek for wales on may celebrations were held to mark the tower s th anniversary big ben is the largest of the tower s five bells and weighs long tons tonnes short tons it was the largest bell in the united kingdom for years the origin of the bell s nickname is open to question it may be named after sir benjamin hall who oversaw its installation or heavyweight boxing champion benjamin caunt four quarter bells chime at and minutes past the hour and just before big ben tolls on the hour the clock uses its original victorian mechanism but an electric motor can be used as a backup the tower is a british cultural icon recognised all over the world it is one of the most prominent symbols of the united kingdom and parliamentary democracy and it is often used in the establishing shot of films set in london the clock tower has been part of a grade i listed building since and a unesco world heritage site since on august a four year schedule of renovation works began on the tower modifications have included adding a lift re glazing and repainting the clock dials and upgrading lighting and repairing roof tiles among other improvements with a few exceptions such as new year s eve and remembrance sunday the bells remained silent elizabeth tower originally referred to as the clock tower but more popularly known as big ben was raised as a part of charles barry s design for a new palace of westminster after the old palace was largely destroyed by fire on october although barry was the chief architect of the neo gothic palace he turned to augustus pugin for the design of the clock tower which resembles earlier pugin designs including one for scarisbrick hall in lancashire construction of the tower began on september the building contractors were thomas grissell and morton peto an inscribed trowel now in the parliamentary archives records that emily sister of peto s daughter in law was given the honour of laying the first stone it was pugin s last design before his descent into mental illness and death in and pugin himself wrote at the time of barry s last visit to him to collect the drawings i never worked so hard in my life for mr barry for tomorrow i render all my designs for finishing his bell tower and it is beautiful completed in the tower is designed in pugin s gothic revival style and is feet m high making it the third tallest clock tower in the uk its dials at the centre are feet m above ground level the tower s base is square measuring feet m on each side resting on concrete foundations feet m thick it was constructed using bricks clad on the exterior with sand coloured anston limestone from south yorkshire topped by a spire covered in hundreds of cast iron rooftiles there is a spiral staircase with stone steps up to the clock room followed by to reach the belfry and an additional to the top of the spire above the belfry and ayrton light are shields decorated with national emblems of the four countries of the uk the red and white rose of england s tudor dynasty the thistle of scotland shamrock of northern ireland and leek of wales they also feature the pomegranate of catherine of aragon first wife of the tudor king henry viii the portcullis symbolising both houses of parliament and fleurs de lis a legacy from when english monarchs claimed to rule france a ventilation shaft running from ground level up to the belfry which measures feet m by feet m was designed by david boswell reid known as the grandfather of air conditioning it was intended to draw cool fresh air into the palace of westminster in practice this did not work and the shaft was repurposed as a chimney until around the conservation works included the addition of a lift or elevator that was installed in the shaft its foundations rest on a layer of gravel below which is london clay owing to this soft ground the tower leans slightly to the north west by roughly mm in over m height giving an inclination of approximately this includes a planned maximum of mm increased tilt due to tunnelling for the jubilee line extension in the s thousands of tons of concrete were pumped into the ground underneath the tower to stabilise it during construction of the westminster section of the jubilee line it leans by about mm in at the finial experts believe the tower s lean will not be a problem for another to years journalists during queen victoria s reign called it st stephen s tower as members of parliament originally sat at st stephen s hall these journalists referred to anything related to the house of commons as news from st stephens the palace does contain a feature called st stephen s tower located above the public entrance on june the house of commons voted in support of a proposal to change the name from the clock tower to elizabeth tower in commemoration of elizabeth ii in her diamond jubilee year since the large west tower now known as victoria tower had been renamed in tribute to queen victoria on the occasion of her diamond jubilee on june the house of commons confirmed that the name change could go ahead david cameron then prime minister officially announced the change of name on september the change was marked by a naming ceremony in which john bercow then speaker of the house of commons unveiled a plaque attached to the tower on the adjoining speaker s green inside the tower is an oak panelled prison room which can only be accessed from the house of commons not via the tower entrance it was last used in when atheist charles bradlaugh newly elected member of parliament for northampton was imprisoned by the serjeant at arms after he protested against swearing a religious oath of allegiance to queen victoria officially the serjeant at arms can still make arrests as they have had the authority to do since the room however is currently occupied by the petitions committee which oversees petitions submitted to parliament a new feature was added in by acton smee ayrton then first commissioner of works and public buildings the ayrton light is a lantern sited above the belfry and is lit whenever the house of commons sits after dark it can be seen from across london originally it shone towards buckingham palace so queen victoria could look out of a window and see when the commons were at work augustus pugin drew inspiration from the clockmaker benjamin lewis vulliamy when he designed the dials each is made of cast iron sections bolted together the whole frame is feet m in diameter making them the third largest in the uk they each contain pieces of opalescent glass originally the dials were backlit using gas lamps at first only when parliament was sitting but they have routinely been illuminated from dusk until dawn since electric bulbs were installed at the beginning of the th century the ornate surrounds of the dials are gilded at the base of each dial is the latin inscription domine salvam fac reginam nostram victoriam primam which means o lord keep safe our queen victoria the first unlike many roman numeral clock dials which show the position as iiii the great clock faces depict as iv the clock s gun metal hour hands and copper minute hands are feet m and feet m long respectively when completed the frame and hands were prussian blue but were painted black in the s to disguise the effects of air pollution the original colour scheme was reinstated during the conservation work it was found that no fewer than six different colour schemes had been used over the past years the victorian glass was also removed and replaced with faithful reproductions made in germany by glassmakers glasfabrik lamberts the clock s movement is known for its reliability the designers were the lawyer and amateur horologist edmund beckett denison and george airy the astronomer royal construction was entrusted to clockmaker edward john dent after his death in his stepson frederick dent completed the work in as the tower was not completed until denison had time to experiment instead of using a deadbeat escapement and remontoire as originally designed he invented a double three legged gravity escapement which provides the best separation between pendulum and clock mechanism thus mitigating the effects of rain wind and snow on the dials dent never patented his design and it quickly became the standard on all new high quality tower clocks on top of the pendulum is a small stack of pre decimal penny coins these are to adjust the time of the clock adding a coin has the effect of minutely lifting the position of the pendulum s centre of mass reducing the effective length of the pendulum rod and hence increasing the rate at which the pendulum swings adding or removing a penny will change the clock s speed by seconds per day it keeps time to within a few seconds per week it is hand wound taking about hours three times a week the keeper of the clock is responsible for looking after the movement in addition to overseeing every aspect of maintenance around the palace a team of horologists are on call hours a day to attend to the clock in the event of an emergency on may a german bombing raid damaged two of the clock s dials and sections of the tower s stepped roof and destroyed the house of commons chamber architect sir giles gilbert scott designed a new five floor block two floors are occupied by the current chamber which was used for the first time on october the clock ran accurately and chimed throughout the blitz the main bell officially known as the great bell but better known as big ben is the largest bell in the tower and part of the great clock of westminster it sounds an e natural the original bell was a ton tonne hour bell cast on august in stockton on tees by john warner sons it is thought that the bell was originally to be called victoria or royal victoria in honour of queen victoria but that an mp suggested the bell s current nickname of big ben during a parliamentary debate the comment is not recorded in hansard since the tower was not yet finished the bell was mounted in new palace yard but during testing it cracked beyond repair and a replacement had to be made the bell was recast on april at the whitechapel bell foundry as a ton tonne bell the second bell was transported from the foundry to the tower on a trolley drawn by sixteen horses with crowds cheering its progress it was then pulled ft m up to the clock tower s belfry a feat that took hours it is feet inches m tall and feet m diameter this new bell first chimed in july in september it too cracked under the hammer according to the foundry s manager george mears the horologist denison had used a hammer more than twice the maximum weight specified for three years big ben was taken out of commission and the hours were struck on the lowest of the quarter bells until it was repaired to make the repair a square piece of metal was chipped out from the rim around the crack and the bell given an eighth of a turn so the new hammer struck in a different place big ben has chimed with a slightly different tone ever since and is still in use today with the crack unrepaired big ben was the largest bell in the british isles until great paul a ton tonne bell currently hung in st paul s cathedral was cast in in august the bell s striker was replaced for the first time since installation the origin of the nickname big ben is the subject of some debate the nickname was applied first to the great bell it may have been named after sir benjamin hall who oversaw the installation of the great bell or after english heavyweight boxing champion benjamin caunt now big ben is often used by extension to refer to the clock the tower and the bell collectively although the nickname is not universally accepted as referring to the clock and tower some authors of works about the tower clock and bell sidestep the issue by using the words big ben first in the title then going on to clarify that the subject of the book is the clock and tower as well as the bell along with the great bell the belfry houses four quarter bells which play the westminster quarters on the quarter hours the four quarter bells sound g f e and b they were cast by john warner sons at their crescent foundry in g f and b and e the foundry was in jewin crescent in what is now known as the barbican in the city of london the bells are sounded by hammers pulled by cables coming from the link room a low ceiling space between the clock room and the belfry where they are triggered by cables coming from the chime train the quarter bells play a once repeating note sequence of rounds and four changes in the key of e major at quarter past at half past and at quarter to and on the hour which sounds seconds before the main bell tolls the hour because the low bell b is struck twice in quick succession there is not enough time to pull a hammer back and it is supplied with two wrench hammers on opposite sides of the bell the tune is that of the cambridge chimes first used for the chimes of great st mary s church cambridge and supposedly a variation attributed to william crotch based on violin phrases from the air i know that my redeemer liveth in handel s messiah the notional words of the chime again derived from great st mary s and in turn an allusion to psalm are all through this hour lord be my guide and by thy power no foot shall slide they are written on a plaque on the wall of the clock room one of the requirements for the clock was that the first stroke of the hour bell should be correct to within one second per day the tolerance is with reference to greenwich mean time bst in summer so at twelve o clock for example it is the first of the twelve hour bell strikes that signifies the hour the new year on new year s eve at midnight the time signalled by the last of the six pips utc may be fractionally different on november remembrance sunday the chimes of big ben returned to regular service for the first time since august preceding the hour bell being sounded at a m local time the first hour strike marking the beginning of two minutes of silence the clock has become a cultural symbol of the united kingdom particularly in the visual media when a television or film maker wishes to indicate a generic location in the country a popular way to do so is to show an image of the tower often with a red double decker bus or black cab in the foreground in a survey of people found that the tower was the most popular landmark in the united kingdom it has also been named as the most iconic film location in london the sound of the clock chiming has also been used this way in audio media the westminster quarters are imitated by other clocks and other devices but the sound of big ben is preferred as the original and best big ben is a focal point of new year celebrations in the united kingdom with radio and television stations airing its chimes to welcome the start of the new year to welcome in the clock tower was lit with fireworks that exploded at every toll of big ben similarly on remembrance day the chimes of big ben are broadcast to mark the th hour of the th day of the th month and the start of the two minutes silence the chimes of big ben have also been used at the state funerals of monarchs on four occasions chiming one stroke for each year of the monarch s life firstly at the funeral of king edward vii in when big ben chimed times secondly at the funeral of king george v in strokes thirdly at the funeral of king george vi in strokes and lastly at the funeral of queen elizabeth ii in strokes londoners who live an appropriate distance from the tower and big ben can by means of listening to the chimes both live and on analogue radio hear the bell strike thirteen times this is possible because the electronically transmitted chimes arrive virtually instantaneously while the live sound is delayed travelling through the air since the speed of sound is relatively slow itn s news at ten opening sequence formerly featured an image of the tower with the sound of big ben s chimes punctuating the announcement of the news headlines of the day the big ben chimes known within itn as the bongs continue to be used during the headlines and all itv news bulletins use a graphic based on the westminster clock dial big ben can also be heard striking the hour before some news bulletins on bbc radio p m and midnight plus p m on sundays and the bbc world service a practice that began on december the sound of the chimes is sent live from a microphone permanently installed in the tower and connected by line to broadcasting house at the close of the polls for the general election the results of the national exit poll were projected onto the south side of the tower on july starting at a m big ben chimed times to welcome the games of the th olympiad which officially began that day to london on august big ben s chimes were silenced for four years to allow essential restoration work to be carried out on the tower the decision to silence the bells was made to protect the hearing of the workers on the tower and drew much criticism from senior mps and prime minister theresa may the striking and tolling of the bells for important occasions such as new year s eve and remembrance sunday was handled via an electric motor and at least one of the four clock faces always remained visible during the restoration scaffolding was put up around the tower immediately after the bells were silenced the original cost of the project to the taxpayers and creditors was estimated to be roughly million but this was then more than doubled to million in february it was confirmed that the renovations had revealed that the elizabeth tower had sustained greater damage than originally thought in the may bombing raid that destroyed the adjacent house of commons other costly discoveries included asbestos in the belfry the extensive use of lead paint broken glass on the clock dials and serious deterioration to the tower s intricate stone carvings due to air pollution the cost of addressing the new problems was estimated at million bringing the total budget for restoring the elizabeth tower to nearly million the cast iron roof tiles have been removed and refurbished and a lift has been installed to make access easier along with a basic toilet facility with running water for the first time in the tower itself the ayrton light at the top of the tower which is lit when parliament is sitting has also been fully dismantled and restored along with the other lights in the belfry the lights being replaced with low energy leds one of the most visible changes to the tower has been the restoration of the clock face framework to its original colour of prussian blue used when the tower was first built in with the black paint that was used to cover up the soot stained dial frames now having been stripped away the clock faces have been regilded and the shields of st george have been repainted in their original red and white colours the pieces of glass that make up the clock faces have also been removed and replaced in december after four years of renovations and restoration the tower emerged from behind its scaffolding in time for the ringing in of the new year in april the gantry supporting the scaffolding was removed leaving the tower free of scaffolding

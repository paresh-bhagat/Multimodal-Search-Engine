 the large hadron collider lhc is the world s largest and highest energy particle collider it was built by the european organization for nuclear research cern between and in collaboration with over scientists and hundreds of universities and laboratories as well as more than countries it lies in a tunnel kilometres mi in circumference and as deep as metres ft beneath the france switzerland border near geneva the first collisions were achieved in at an energy of teraelectronvolts tev per beam about four times the previous world record after upgrades it reached tev per beam tev total collision energy at the end of it was shut down for three years for further upgrades the collider has four crossing points where the accelerated particles collide seven detectors each designed to detect different phenomena are positioned around the crossing points the lhc primarily collides proton beams but it can also accelerate beams of heavy ions lead lead collisions and proton lead collisions are typically performed for one month a year the lhc s goal is to allow physicists to test the predictions of different theories of particle physics including measuring the properties of the higgs boson searching for the large family of new particles predicted by supersymmetric theories and other unresolved questions in particle physics the term hadron refers to subatomic composite particles composed of quarks held together by the strong force analogous to the way that atoms and molecules are held together by the electromagnetic force the best known hadrons are the baryons such as protons and neutrons hadrons also include mesons such as the pion and kaon which were discovered during cosmic ray experiments in the late s and early s a collider is a type of a particle accelerator which brings two opposing particle beams together such that the particles collide in particle physics colliders though harder to construct are a powerful research tool because they reach a much higher center of mass energy than fixed target setups analysis of the byproducts of these collisions gives scientists good evidence of the structure of the subatomic world and the laws of nature governing it many of these byproducts are produced only by high energy collisions and they decay after very short periods of time thus many of them are hard or nearly impossible to study in other ways many physicists hope that the large hadron collider will help answer some of the fundamental open questions in physics which concern the basic laws governing the interactions and forces among the elementary objects the deep structure of space and time and in particular the interrelation between quantum mechanics and general relativity data are also needed from high energy particle experiments to suggest which versions of current scientific models are more likely to be correct in particular to choose between the standard model and higgsless model and to validate their predictions and allow further theoretical development issues explored by lhc collisions include other open questions that may be explored using high energy particle collisions the collider is contained in a circular tunnel with a circumference of kilometres mi at a depth ranging from to metres to ft underground the variation in depth was deliberate to reduce the amount of tunnel that lies under the jura mountains to avoid having to excavate a vertical access shaft there a tunnel was chosen to avoid having to purchase expensive land on the surface which would also have an impact on the landscape and to take advantage of the shielding against background radiation that the earth s crust provides the metre ft wide concrete lined tunnel constructed between and was formerly used to house the large electron positron collider the tunnel crosses the border between switzerland and france at four points with most of it in france surface buildings hold ancillary equipment such as compressors ventilation equipment control electronics and refrigeration plants the collider tunnel contains two adjacent parallel beamlines or beam pipes each containing a beam which travel in opposite directions around the ring the beams intersect at four points around the ring which is where the particle collisions take place some dipole magnets keep the beams on their circular path see image while an additional quadrupole magnets are used to keep the beams focused with stronger quadrupole magnets close to the intersection points in order to maximize the chances of interaction where the two beams cross magnets of higher multipole orders are used to correct smaller imperfections in the field geometry in total about superconducting magnets are installed with the dipole magnets having a mass of over tonnes approximately tonnes of superfluid helium is needed to keep the magnets made of copper clad niobium titanium at their operating temperature of k c making the lhc the largest cryogenic facility in the world at liquid helium temperature lhc uses tonnes of nb ti superconductor during lhc operations the cern site draws roughly mw of electrical power from the french electrical grid which for comparison is about one third the energy consumption of the city of geneva the lhc accelerator and detectors draw about mw thereof each day of its operation generates terabytes of data when running an energy of tev per proton once or twice a day as the protons are accelerated from gev to tev the field of the superconducting dipole magnets is increased from to teslas t the protons each have an energy of tev giving a total collision energy of tev at this energy the protons have a lorentz factor of about and move at about c or about m s km h slower than the speed of light c it takes less than microseconds s for a proton to travel km around the main ring this results in revolutions per second for protons whether the particles are at low or high energy in the main ring since the speed difference between these energies is beyond the fifth decimal rather than having continuous beams the protons are bunched together into up to bunches with billion protons in each bunch so that interactions between the two beams take place at discrete intervals mainly nanoseconds ns apart providing a bunch collision rate of mhz it was operated with fewer bunches in the first years the design luminosity of the lhc is cm s which was first reached in june by twice this value was achieved before being injected into the main accelerator the particles are prepared by a series of systems that successively increase their energy the first system is the linear particle accelerator linac generating mev negative hydrogen ions h ions which feeds the proton synchrotron booster psb there both electrons are stripped from the hydrogen ions leaving only the nucleus containing one proton protons are then accelerated to gev and injected into the proton synchrotron ps where they are accelerated to gev finally the super proton synchrotron sps is used to increase their energy further to gev before they are at last injected over a period of several minutes into the main ring here the proton bunches are accumulated accelerated over a period of minutes to their peak energy and finally circulated for to hours while collisions occur at the four intersection points the lhc physics programme is mainly based on proton proton collisions however during shorter running periods typically one month per year heavy ion collisions are included in the programme while lighter ions are considered as well the baseline scheme deals with lead ions see a large ion collider experiment the lead ions are first accelerated by the linear accelerator linac and the low energy ion ring leir is used as an ion storage and cooler unit the ions are then further accelerated by the ps and sps before being injected into lhc ring where they reach an energy of tev per nucleon or tev per ion higher than the energies reached by the relativistic heavy ion collider the aim of the heavy ion programme is to investigate quark gluon plasma which existed in the early universe nine detectors have been constructed at the lhc located underground in large caverns excavated at the lhc s intersection points two of them the atlas experiment and the compact muon solenoid cms are large general purpose particle detectors alice and lhcb have more specialized roles and the other five totem moedal lhcf snd and faser are much smaller and are for very specialized research the atlas and cms experiments discovered the higgs boson which is strong evidence that the standard model has the correct mechanism of giving mass to elementary particles data produced by lhc as well as lhc related simulation were estimated at approximately petabytes per year max throughput while running is not stated a major challenge in its own right at the time the lhc computing grid was constructed as part of the lhc design to handle the massive amounts of data expected for its collisions it is an international collaborative project that consists of a grid based computer network infrastructure initially connecting computing centres in countries over in countries as of update it was designed by cern to handle the significant volume of data produced by lhc experiments incorporating both private fibre optic cable links and existing high speed portions of the public internet to enable data transfer from cern to academic institutions around the world the open science grid is used as the primary infrastructure in the united states and also as part of an interoperable federation with the lhc computing grid the distributed computing project lhc home was started to support the construction and calibration of the lhc the project uses the boinc platform enabling anybody with an internet connection and a computer running mac os x windows or linux to use their computer s idle time to simulate how particles will travel in the beam pipes with this information the scientists are able to determine how the magnets should be calibrated to gain the most stable orbit of the beams in the ring in august a second application test theory went live which performs simulations against which to compare actual test data to determine confidence levels of the results by data from over quadrillion lhc proton proton collisions had been analysed lhc collision data was being produced at approximately petabytes per year and the lhc computing grid had become the world s largest computing grid in comprising over computing facilities in a worldwide network across countries the lhc first went operational on september but initial testing was delayed for months from september to november following a magnet quench incident that caused extensive damage to over superconducting magnets their mountings and the vacuum pipe during its first run the lhc collided two opposing particle beams of either protons at up to teraelectronvolts tev or microjoules or lead nuclei tev per nucleus or tev per nucleon its first run discoveries included the long sought higgs boson several composite particles hadrons like the b p bottomonium state the first creation of a quark gluon plasma and the first observations of the very rare decay of the bs meson into two muons bs which challenged the validity of existing models of supersymmetry the size of the lhc constitutes an exceptional engineering challenge with unique operational issues on account of the amount of energy stored in the magnets and the beams while operating the total energy stored in the magnets is gj kilograms of tnt and the total energy carried by the two beams reaches mj kilograms of tnt loss of only one ten millionth part of the beam is sufficient to quench a superconducting magnet while each of the two beam dumps must absorb mj kilograms of tnt these energies are carried by very little matter under nominal operating conditions bunches per beam protons per bunch the beam pipes contain gram of hydrogen which in standard conditions for temperature and pressure would fill the volume of one grain of fine sand with a budget of billion approx bn or bn as of june update the lhc is one of the most expensive scientific instruments ever built the total cost of the project is expected to be of the order of bn swiss francs sfr approx bn bn or bn as of january update for the accelerator and bn sfr approx bn bn or bn as of january update for the cern contribution to the experiments the construction of lhc was approved in with a budget of sfr bn with another sfr m toward the experiments however cost overruns estimated in a major review in at around sfr m for the accelerator and sfr m for the experiments along with a reduction in cern s budget pushed the completion date from to april the superconducting magnets were responsible for sfr m of the cost increase there were also further costs and delays owing to engineering difficulties encountered while building the cavern for the compact muon solenoid and also due to magnet supports which were insufficiently strongly designed and failed their initial testing and damage from a magnet quench and liquid helium escape inaugural testing see construction accidents and delays because electricity costs are lower during the summer the lhc normally does not operate over the winter months although exceptions over the and winters were made to make up for the start up delays and to improve precision of measurements of the new particle discovered in respectively with the invasion of ukraine by russia the participation of russians with cern was called into question approximately of the workforce are of russian nationality in june cern said the governing council intends to terminate cern s cooperation agreements with belarus and russia when they expire respectively in june and december cern said it would monitor developments in ukraine and remains prepared to take additional steps as warranted cern further said that it would reduce the ukrainian contribution to cern for to the amount already remitted to the organization thereby waiving the second instalment of the contribution in both of its runs to and the lhc was initially run at energies below its planned operating energy and ramped up to just x tev energy on its first run and x tev on its second run below the design energy of x tev this is because massive superconducting magnets require considerable magnet training to handle the high currents involved without losing their superconducting ability and the high currents are necessary to allow a high proton energy the training process involves repeatedly running the magnets with lower currents to provoke any quenches or minute movements that may result it also takes time to cool down magnets to their operating temperature of around k close to absolute zero over time the magnet beds in and ceases to quench at these lesser currents and can handle the full design current without quenching cern media describe the magnets as shaking out the unavoidable tiny manufacturing imperfections in their crystals and positions that had initially impaired their ability to handle their planned currents the magnets over time and with training gradually become able to handle their full planned currents without quenching the first beam was circulated through the collider on the morning of september cern successfully fired the protons around the tunnel in stages three kilometres at a time the particles were fired in a clockwise direction into the accelerator and successfully steered around it at local time the lhc successfully completed its major test after a series of trial runs two white dots flashed on a computer screen showing the protons travelled the full length of the collider it took less than one hour to guide the stream of particles around its inaugural circuit cern next successfully sent a beam of protons in an anticlockwise direction taking slightly longer at one and a half hours owing to a problem with the cryogenics with the full circuit being completed at on september a magnet quench occurred in about bending magnets in sectors and where an electrical fault led to a loss of approximately six tonnes of liquid helium the magnets cryogenic coolant which was vented into the tunnel the escaping vapour expanded with explosive force damaging a total of superconducting magnets and their mountings and contaminating the vacuum pipe which also lost vacuum conditions shortly after the incident cern reported that the most likely cause of the problem was a faulty electrical connection between two magnets and that owing to the time needed to warm up the affected sectors and then cool them back down to operating temperature it would take at least two months to fix cern released an interim technical report and preliminary analysis of the incident on and october respectively and a more detailed report on december the analysis of the incident by cern confirmed that an electrical fault had indeed been the cause the faulty electrical connection had led correctly to a failsafe power abort of the electrical systems powering the superconducting magnets but had also caused an electric arc or discharge which damaged the integrity of the supercooled helium s enclosure and vacuum insulation causing the coolant s temperature and pressure to rapidly rise beyond the ability of the safety systems to contain it and leading to a temperature rise of about degrees celsius in some of the affected magnets energy stored in the superconducting magnets and electrical noise induced in other quench detectors also played a role in the rapid heating around two tonnes of liquid helium escaped explosively before detectors triggered an emergency stop and a further four tonnes leaked at lower pressure in the aftermath a total of magnets were damaged in the incident and were repaired or replaced during the winter shutdown this accident was thoroughly discussed in a february superconductor science and technology article by cern physicist lucio rossi in the original schedule for lhc commissioning the first modest high energy collisions at a centre of mass energy of gev were expected to take place before the end of september and the lhc was expected to be operating at tev by the end of however owing to the delay caused by the incident the collider was not operational until november despite the delay lhc was officially inaugurated on october in the presence of political leaders science ministers from cern s member states cern officials and members of the worldwide scientific community most of was spent on repairs and reviews from the damage caused by the quench incident along with two further vacuum leaks identified in july this pushed the start of operations to november of that year on november low energy beams circulated in the tunnel for the first time since the incident and shortly after on november the lhc achieved tev per beam to become the world s highest energy particle accelerator beating the tevatron s previous record of tev per beam held for eight years the early part of saw the continued ramp up of beam in energies and early physics experiments towards tev per beam and on march lhc set a new record for high energy collisions by colliding proton beams at a combined energy level of tev the attempt was the third that day after two unsuccessful attempts in which the protons had to be dumped from the collider and new beams had to be injected this also marked the start of the main research programme the first proton run ended on november a run with lead ions started on november and ended on december allowing the alice experiment to study matter under extreme conditions similar to those shortly after the big bang cern originally planned that the lhc would run through to the end of with a short break at the end of to allow for an increase in beam energy from to tev per beam at the end of the lhc was planned to be temporarily shut down until around to allow upgrade to a planned beam energy of tev per beam in late in light of the july discovery of the higgs boson the shutdown was postponed for some weeks into early to allow additional data to be obtained before shutdown the lhc was shut down on february for its year upgrade called long shutdown ls which was to touch on many aspects of the lhc enabling collisions at tev enhancing its detectors and pre accelerators the proton synchrotron and super proton synchrotron as well as replacing its ventilation system and km mi of cabling impaired by high energy collisions from its first run the upgraded collider began its long start up and testing process in june with the proton synchrotron booster starting on june the final interconnection between magnets completing and the proton synchrotron circulating particles on june and the first section of the main lhc supermagnet system reaching operating temperature of k c a few days later due to the slow progress with training the superconducting magnets it was decided to start the second run with a lower energy of tev per beam corresponding to a current of amperes the first of the main lhc magnets were reported to have been successfully trained by december while training the other magnet sectors was finished in march on april the lhc restarted after a two year break during which the electrical connectors between the bending magnets were upgraded to safely handle the current required for tev per beam tev collision energy however the bending magnets were only trained to handle up to tev per beam tev collision energy which became the operating energy for to the energy was first reached on april the upgrades culminated in colliding protons together with a combined energy of tev on june the lhc started delivering physics data after almost two years offline in the following months it was used for proton proton collisions while in november the machine switched to collisions of lead ions and in december the usual winter shutdown started in the machine operators focused on increasing the luminosity for proton proton collisions the design value was first reached june and further improvements increased the collision rate to above the design value the total number of collisions in exceeded the number from run at a higher energy per collision the proton proton run was followed by four weeks of proton lead collisions in the luminosity was increased further and reached twice the design value the total number of collisions was higher than in as well the physics run began on april and stopped on december including four weeks of lead lead collisions long shutdown ls started on december the lhc and the whole cern accelerator complex was maintained and upgraded the goal of the upgrades was to implement the high luminosity large hadron collider hl lhc project that will increase the luminosity by a factor of ls ended in april the long shutdown ls in the s will take place before the hl lhc project is done lhc became operational again on april with a new maximum beam energy of tev tev collision energy which was first achieved on april it officially commenced its run physics season on july this round is expected to continue until in addition to a higher energy the lhc is expected to reach a higher luminosity which is expected to increase even further with the upgrade to the hl lhc after run an initial focus of research was to investigate the possible existence of the higgs boson a key part of the standard model of physics which was predicted by theory but had not yet been observed before due to its high mass and elusive nature cern scientists estimated that if the standard model was correct the lhc would produce several higgs bosons every minute allowing physicists to finally confirm or disprove the higgs boson s existence in addition the lhc allowed the search for supersymmetric particles and other hypothetical particles as possible unknown areas of physics some extensions of the standard model predict additional particles such as the heavy w and z gauge bosons which are also estimated to be within reach of the lhc to discover the first physics results from the lhc involving collisions which took place in the alice detector were reported on december the results of the first proton proton collisions at energies higher than fermilab s tevatron proton antiproton collisions were published by the cms collaboration in early february yielding greater than predicted charged hadron production after the first year of data collection the lhc experimental collaborations started to release their preliminary results concerning searches for new physics beyond the standard model in proton proton collisions no evidence of new particles was detected in the data as a result bounds were set on the allowed parameter space of various extensions of the standard model such as models with large extra dimensions constrained versions of the minimal supersymmetric standard model and others on may it was reported that quark gluon plasma the densest matter thought to exist besides black holes had been created in the lhc between july and august results of searches for the higgs boson and for exotic particles based on the data collected during the first half of the run were presented in conferences in grenoble and mumbai in the latter conference it was reported that despite hints of a higgs signal in earlier data atlas and cms exclude with confidence level using the cls method the existence of a higgs boson with the properties predicted by the standard model over most of the mass region between and gev the searches for new particles did not yield signals either allowing to further constrain the parameter space of various extensions of the standard model including its supersymmetric extensions on december cern reported that the standard model higgs boson if it exists is most likely to have a mass constrained to the range gev both the cms and atlas detectors have also shown intensity peaks in the gev range consistent with either background noise or the observation of the higgs boson on december it was reported that a new composite particle had been observed the b p bottomonium state on july both the cms and atlas teams announced the discovery of a boson in the mass region around gev with a statistical significance at the level of sigma each this meets the formal level required to announce a new particle the observed properties were consistent with the higgs boson but scientists were cautious as to whether it is formally identified as actually being the higgs boson pending further analysis on march cern announced confirmation that the observed particle was indeed the predicted higgs boson on november the lhcb team reported on an experiment seen as a golden test of supersymmetry theories in physics by measuring the very rare decay of the b s displaystyle b s meson into two muons b s displaystyle b s rightarrow mu mu the results which match those predicted by the non supersymmetrical standard model rather than the predictions of many branches of supersymmetry show the decays are less common than some forms of supersymmetry predict though could still match the predictions of other versions of supersymmetry theory the results as initially drafted are stated to be short of proof but at a relatively high sigma level of significance the result was later confirmed by the cms collaboration in august the lhcb team revealed an anomaly in the angular distribution of b meson decay products which could not be predicted by the standard model this anomaly had a statistical certainty of sigma just short of the sigma needed to be officially recognized as a discovery it is unknown what the cause of this anomaly would be although the z boson has been suggested as a possible candidate on november the lhcb experiment announced the discovery of two new heavy subatomic particles b and b both of them are baryons that are composed of one bottom one down and one strange quark they are excited states of the bottom xi baryon the lhcb collaboration has observed multiple exotic hadrons possibly pentaquarks or tetraquarks in the run data on april the collaboration confirmed the existence of the tetraquark candidate z with a significance of over sigma on july results consistent with pentaquark states in the decay of bottom lambda baryons b were reported on june the collaboration announced four tetraquark like particles decaying into a j and a meson only one of which was well established before x x and x and x in december atlas presented a measurement of the w boson mass researching the precision of analyses done at the tevatron at the conference eps hep in july the collaborations presented first cross section measurements of several particles at the higher collision energy on december the atlas and cms experiments both reported a number of preliminary results for higgs physics supersymmetry susy searches and exotics searches using tev proton collision data both experiments saw a moderate excess around gev in the two photon invariant mass spectrum but the experiments did not confirm the existence of the hypothetical particle in an august report in july many analyses based on the large dataset collected in were shown the properties of the higgs boson were studied in more detail and the precision of many other results was improved as of march the lhc experiments have discovered new hadrons in the data collected during the first two runs on july lhcb reported the discovery of a new type of pentaquark made up of a charm quark and a charm antiquark and an up a down and a strange quark observed in an analysis of decays of charged b mesons after some years of running any particle physics experiment typically begins to suffer from diminishing returns as the key results reachable by the device begin to be completed later years of operation discover proportionately less than earlier years a common response is to upgrade the devices involved typically in collision energy luminosity or improved detectors in addition to a possible increase to tev collision energy a luminosity upgrade of the lhc called the high luminosity large hadron collider started in june that will boost the accelerator s potential for new discoveries in physics starting in the upgrade aims at increasing the luminosity of the machine by a factor of up to cm s providing a better chance to see rare processes and improving statistically marginal measurements cern has several preliminary designs for a future circular collider fcc which would be the most powerful particle smasher ever built with different types of collider ranging in cost from around billion us billion to billion it is cern s opening bid in a priority setting process called the european strategy for particle physics update and will affect the field s future well into the second half of the century not everyone is convinced that the fcc is a good investment there is no reason to think that there should be new physics in the energy regime that such a collider would reach says sabine hossenfelder a theoretical physicist at the frankfurt institute for advanced studies in germany hossenfelder says that the large sums involved might be better spent on other types of huge facility for example she says that placing a major radio telescope on the far side of the moon or a gravitational wave detector in orbit would both be safer bets than the collider in terms of their return on science the experiments at the large hadron collider sparked fears that the particle collisions might produce doomsday phenomena involving the production of stable microscopic black holes or the creation of hypothetical particles called strangelets two cern commissioned safety reviews examined these concerns and concluded that the experiments at the lhc present no danger and that there is no reason for concern a conclusion endorsed by the american physical society the reports also noted that the physical conditions and collision events that exist in the lhc and similar experiments occur naturally and routinely in the universe without hazardous consequences including ultra high energy cosmic rays observed to impact earth with energies far higher than those in any human made collider the large hadron collider gained a considerable amount of attention from outside the scientific community and its progress is followed by most popular science media the lhc has also inspired works of fiction including novels tv series video games and films cern employee katherine mcalpine s large hadron rap

 the washington monument is an obelisk shaped building within the national mall in washington d c built to commemorate george washington once commander in chief of the continental army in the american revolutionary war and the first president of the united states located almost due east of the reflecting pool and the lincoln memorial the monument made of marble granite and bluestone gneiss is both the world s tallest predominantly stone structure and the world s tallest obelisk a standing feet inches m tall according to the u s national geodetic survey measured or feet inches m tall according to the national park service measured b it is the tallest monumental column in the world if all are measured above their pedestrian entrances a it was the tallest structure in the world between and after which it was overtaken by the eiffel tower in paris previously the tallest structure was the cologne cathedral construction of the presidential memorial began in and was halted for a period of years from to due to a lack of funds a struggle for control over the washington national monument society and the american civil war although the stone structure was completed in internal ironwork the knoll and installation of memorial stones were not completed until a difference in shading of the marble visible approximately feet m or up shows where construction was halted and later resumed with marble from a different source the original design was by robert mills of south carolina but he did not include his proposed colonnade due to a lack of funds proceeding only with a bare obelisk the cornerstone was laid on july the first stone was laid atop the unfinished stump on august the capstone was set on december the completed monument was dedicated on february and officially opened october the washington monument is a hollow egyptian style stone obelisk with a foot m tall column surmounted by a foot m tall pyramidion its walls are feet m thick at its base and feet m thick at their top the marble pyramidion has thin walls only inches cm thick supported by six arches two between opposite walls that cross at the center of the pyramidion and four smaller corner arches the top of the pyramidion is a large marble capstone with a small aluminum pyramid at its apex with inscriptions on all four sides the lowest feet m of the walls constructed during the first phase are composed of a pile of bluestone gneiss rubble stones not finished stones held together by a large amount of mortar with a facade of semi finished marble stones about feet m thick the upper feet m of the walls constructed during the second phase are composed of finished marble surface stones half of which project into the walls partially backed by finished granite stones the interior is occupied by iron stairs that spiral up the walls with an elevator in the center each supported by four iron columns which do not support the stone structure the stairs contain fifty sections most on the north and south walls with many long landings stretching between them along the east and west walls these landings allowed many inscribed memorial stones of various materials and sizes to be easily viewed while the stairs were accessible until plus one memorial stone between stairs that is difficult to view the pyramidion has eight observation windows two per side and eight red aircraft warning lights two per side two aluminum lightning rods connected via the elevator support columns to ground water protect the monument the monument s present foundation is feet m thick consisting of half of its original bluestone gneiss rubble encased in concrete at the northeast corner of the foundation feet m below ground is the marble cornerstone including a zinc case filled with memorabilia fifty american flags fly on a large circle of poles centered on the monument in a temporary screening facility was added to the entrance to prevent a terrorist attack an earthquake in slightly damaged the monument and it was closed until it was closed again for elevator system repairs security upgrades and mitigation of soil contamination from august to september george washington hailed as the father of his country and as the leader who was first in war first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen in eulogy by maj gen light horse harry lee at washington s funeral december was the dominant military and political leader of the new united states of america from to even his former enemy king george iii called him the greatest character of the age at his death in he left a critical legacy washington was the unchallenged public icon of american military and civic patriotism he was also identified with the federalist party which lost control of the national government in to the jeffersonian republicans who were reluctant to celebrate the hero of the opposition party starting with victory in the revolution there were many proposals to build a monument to washington beginning with an authorization in by the old confederation congress to erect an equestrian statue of the general in a future american national capital city after his december death the united states congress authorized a suitable memorial in the planned national capital then under construction since but the decision was reversed when the democratic republican party jeffersonian republicans took control of congress in after the pivotal election with the first change of power between opposing political parties the republicans were dismayed that washington had become the symbol of the federalist party furthermore the values of republicanism seemed hostile to the idea of building monuments to powerful men they also blocked his image on coins or the celebration of his birthday further political squabbling along with the north south division on the civil war blocked the completion of the washington monument until the late th century by that time washington had the image of a national hero who could be celebrated by both north and south and memorials to him were no longer controversial as early as the old confederation congress successors after to the earlier second continental congress had resolved that an equestrian statue of george washington be erected at the place where the residence of congress shall be established the proposal called for engraving on the statue which explained it had been erected in honor of george washington the illustrious commander in chief of the armies of the united states of america during the war which vindicated and secured their liberty sovereignty and independence currently there are two equestrian statues of president washington in the national capital city of washington d c one is located in washington circle at the intersection of the foggy bottom and west end neighborhoods at the north end of the george washington university campus and the other is in the gardens of the national cathedral of the episcopal church on mount st alban in northwest washington on december days after washington s death a u s congressional committee recommended a different type of monument john marshall a representative from virginia who later became chief justice of the united states proposed that a tomb be erected within the capitol and it was designed later to place such a crypt sepulchre below the rotunda of the great dome however a lack of funds disagreement over what type of memorial would best honor the country s first president and the washington family s reluctance to move his body from mount vernon prevented progress on any project progress toward a memorial finally began in that year a large group of citizens formed the washington national monument society three years later in after they had raised in donations equivalent to in they announced a competition for the design of the memorial chp on september the board of managers of the society described their expectations it is proposed that the contemplated monument shall be like him in whose honor it is to be constructed unparalleled in the world and commensurate with the gratitude liberality and patriotism of the people by whom it is to be erected it should blend stupendousness with elegance and be of such magnitude and beauty as to be an object of pride to the american people and of admiration to all who see it its material is intended to be wholly american and to be of marble and granite brought from each state that each state may participate in the glory of contributing material as well as in funds to its construction the society held a competition for designs in in the winner was announced to be architect robert mills supposedly the first native born american to be professionally trained as an architect the citizens of baltimore had chosen him in to build one of the first monuments to george washington originally planned for the former courthouse square in their port city and he had designed a tall elaborately decorated greek column with balconies surmounted by a statue of the president mills baltimore monument with cornerstone laid and construction begun in was later simplified to a plain column shaft with a statue of a toga clad washington at the top when it was completed in but moved because of its height to the then rural hills to the north where the city s growth would later extend mills also knew the capital well with its being only miles kilometers southwest of baltimore and his having just been chosen architect of public buildings for washington his design called for a circular colonnaded building feet m in diameter and feet m high from which sprang a four sided obelisk feet m high for a total elevation of feet m a massive cylindrical pillar feet m in diameter supported the obelisk at the center of the building the obelisk was to be feet m square c at the base and feet m square at the top with a slightly peaked roof both the obelisk and pillar were hollow within which a railway spiraled up the obelisk had no doorway instead its interior was entered from the interior of the pillar upon which it was mounted the pillar had an arched way at its base the top of the portico of the building would feature washington standing in a chariot holding the reins of six horses inside the colonnade would be statues of prominent revolutionary war heroes as well as statues of the signers of the declaration of independence criticism of mills s design and its estimated price tag of more than million in money equivalent to in caused the society to hesitate on april the society decided due to a lack of funds to build only a simple plain obelisk mills s obelisk was to be feet m tall feet m square at the base and feet m square at the top it had two massive doorways each feet m high and feet m wide on the east and west sides of its base surrounding each doorway were raised jambs a heavy pediment and entablature within which was carved an egyptian style winged sun and asps some of these details can be seen in the photograph below at donations run out after clicking on the image and viewing the original file at its highest magnification this original design conformed to a massive temple which was to have surrounded the base of the obelisk but because it was never built the architect of the second phase of construction thomas lincoln casey smoothed down the projecting jambs pediment and entablature in walled up the west entrance with marble forming an alcove and reduced the east entrance to feet m high the western alcove has contained a bronze statue of washington since also during a limestone surround was installed at the east elevator entrance decorated with a winged sun and asps to mimic mills s design the washington monument was originally intended to be located at the point at which a line running directly south from the center of the white house crossed a line running directly west from the center of the u s capitol on capitol hill french born and military engineer pierre peter charles l enfant s visionary plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of the united states designated this point as the location of the proposed central equestrian statue of george washington that the old confederation congress had voted for in at the end of the american revolutionary war in a future american national capital city d the ground at the intended location proved to be too unstable to support a structure as heavy as the planned obelisk so the monument s location was moved feet m east southeast e at that originally intended site there now stands a small monolith called the jefferson pier this offset caused the mcmillan plan to specify that the lincoln memorial should be placed on the main axis of the capitol and the monument about south of due west of the capitol or the monument not due west of the capitol or the monument f construction of the monument finally began three years later in with the excavation of the site the laying of the cornerstone on the prepared bed and laying the original foundation around and on top of the cornerstone before the construction of its massive walls began the next year regarding modern claims of slave labor being used in construction washington monument historian john steele gordon stated i can t say for certain but the stonemasonry was pretty highly skilled so it s unlikely that slaves would ve been doing it the stones were cut by stonecutters which is highly skilled work and the stones were hoisted by means of steam engines so you d need a skilled engineer and foreman for stuff like that tending the steam engine building the cast iron staircase inside that wasn t grunt work the early quarries were in maryland so slave labor was undoubtedly used to quarry and haul the stone abraham riesman who quoted gordon states there were plenty of people who worked as skilled laborers while enslaved in antebellum america indeed there were enslaved people who worked as stonemasons so the possibility remains that there were slaves who performed some of the necessary skilled labor for the monument according to historian jesse holland it is very likely that african american slaves were among the construction workers given that slavery prevailed in washington and its surrounding states at that time and slaves were commonly used in public and private construction gordon s arguments are valid for the second phase after slavery was abolished when every stone laid required dressing and polishing by a skilled stonemason this includes the iron staircase which was constructed that the stonecutters in the quarry were slaves is confirmed because all quarry workers were slaves during the construction of the united states capitol during the s however holland s views are valid for the first phase because most of its construction only required unskilled manual labor no information survives concerning the method used to lift stones that weighed several tons each during the first phase whether by a manual winch or a steam engine the surviving information concerning slaves that built the core of the united states capitol during the s is not much help at the time the district of columbia outside of georgetown was sparsely populated so the federal government rented slaves from their owners who were paid a fee for their slaves normal daily labor any overtime for sundays holidays and nights was paid directly to the slaves which they could use for daily needs or to save to buy their freedom conversely the first phase of the monument was constructed by a private entity the washington national monument society which may not have been as magnanimous as the federal government but most information was lost during the s while two societies vied for control of the monument useful information concerning the use of slaves during the major expansion of the capitol during the s nearly contemporaneous with the monument s first phase does not exist only a small number of stones used in the first phase required a skilled stonemason the marble blocks on the outer surface of the monument their inner surfaces were left very rough and those gneiss stones that form the rough inner walls of the monument all other surfaces of those inner stones within the walls were left jagged the vast majority of all gneiss stones laid during the first phase those between the outer and inner surfaces of the walls from very large to very small jagged stones form a pile of rubble held together by a large amount of mortar the top surface of this rubble can be seen below at walls in an drawing made just before the polished rough marble and granite stones used in the second phase were laid atop it the original foundation below the walls was made of layered gneiss rubble but without the massive stones used within the walls most of the gneiss stones used during the first phase were obtained from quarries in the upper potomac river valley almost all the marble stones of the first and second phases came from two maryland quarries about miles km north of downtown baltimore in rural baltimore county where stone for their first washington monument was obtained citation needed on independence day july the freemasons the same organization to which washington belonged laid the cornerstone symbolically not physically according to joseph r chandler no more washingtons shall come in our time but his virtues are stamped on the heart of mankind he who is great in the battlefield looks upward to the generalship of washington he who grows wise in counsel feels that he is imitating washington he who can resign power against the wishes of a people has in his eye the bright example of washington two years later on a torrid july george washington parke custis the adopted son of george washington and grandson of martha washington dedicated a stone from the people of the district of columbia to the monument at a ceremony that th president zachary taylor served attended just five days before he died from food poisoning construction continued until when donations ran out and the monument had reached a height of feet m at that time a memorial stone that was contributed by pope pius ix called the pope s stone was destroyed by members of the anti catholic nativist american party better known as the know nothings during the early morning hours of march a priest replaced it in using the latin phrase a roma americae instead of the original stone s english phrase rome to america economic and political conditions of the time caused public contributions to the washington national monument society to cease so they appealed to congress for money the request had just reached the floor of the house of representatives when the know nothing party seized control of the society on february a year after construction funds ran out congress immediately tabled its expected contribution of to the society effectively halting the federal appropriation during its tenure the know nothing society added only two courses of masonry or feet m to the monument using rejected masonry it found on site increasing the height of the shaft to feet m the original society refused to recognize the takeover so the two rival societies existed side by side until with the know nothing party disintegrating and unable to secure contributions for the monument it surrendered its possession of the monument to the original society three and a half years later on october to prevent future takeovers the u s congress incorporated the society on february with a stated charter and set of rules and procedures chp the american civil war halted all work on the monument but interest grew after the war s end engineers studied the foundation several times to determine if it was strong enough for continued construction after years of effective inactivity in the american centennial of the declaration of independence congress agreed to appropriate another to resume construction before work could begin again arguments about the most appropriate design resumed many people thought a simple obelisk one without the colonnade would be too bare architect mills was reputed to have said omitting the colonnade would make the monument look like a stalk of asparagus another critic said it offered little to be proud of this attitude led people to submit alternative designs both the washington national monument society and congress held discussions about how the monument should be finished the society considered five new designs concluding that the one by william wetmore story seemed vastly superior in artistic taste and beauty congress deliberated over those five as well as mills s original while it was deciding it ordered work on the obelisk to continue finally the members of the society agreed to abandon the colonnade and alter the obelisk so it conformed to classical egyptian proportions construction resumed in under the direction of lieutenant colonel thomas lincoln casey of the united states army corps of engineers casey redesigned the foundation strengthening it so it could support a structure that ultimately weighed more than tons tonnes the first stone atop the unfinished stump was laid on august in a small ceremony attended by president rutherford b hayes casey and a few others the president placed a small coin on which he had scratched his initials and the date in the bed of wet cement at the foot m level before the first stone was laid on top of it casey found memorial stones presented stones already inlaid into the interior walls of the first phase of construction before construction continued he temporarily removed eight stones at the foot m level so that the walls at that level could be sloped outward producing thinner second phase walls he inserted those stones and most of the remaining memorial stones stored in the lapidarium into the interior walls during the bottom third of the monument is a slightly lighter shade than the rest of the construction because the marble was obtained from different quarries the building of the monument proceeded quickly after congress had provided sufficient funding in four years it was completed with the ounce kg aluminum apex lightning rod being put in place on december the apex was the largest single piece of aluminum cast at the time when aluminum commanded a price comparable to silver two years later the hall h roult process made aluminum easier to produce and the price of aluminum plummeted though it should have provided a lustrous non rusting apex g the monument opened to the public on october the monument was dedicated on february over people were present on the monument grounds to hear speeches during a frigid day by ohio senator john sherman the rev henderson suter william wilson corcoran of the washington national monument society read by dr james c welling because corcoran was unable to attend freemason myron m parker col thomas lincoln casey of the army corps of engineers and president chester a arthur president arthur proclaimed i do now in behalf of the people receive this monument and declare it dedicated from this time forth to the immortal name and memory of george washington after the speeches lieutenant general philip sheridan civil war cavalry veteran and then general in chief of the united states army led a procession which included the dignitaries and the crowd past the executive mansion now the white house then via pennsylvania avenue to the east main entrance of the capitol where st president chester arthur served received passing troops then in the house of representatives chamber at the u s capitol the president his cabinet diplomats and others listened to representative john davis long former lieutenant governor and governor of massachusetts and future secretary of the navy read a speech written a few months earlier by robert c winthrop formerly the speaker of the house of representatives when the cornerstone was laid years earlier in but now too ill to personally deliver his speech a final speech was given by john w daniel of virginia a well regarded lawyer author and representative congressman and senator the festivities concluded that evening with fireworks both aerial and ground displays at completion it was the tallest building in the world until the eiffel tower was completed four years later in paris in it is still the tallest building in washington d c the heights of buildings act of restricts new building heights to no more than feet m greater than the width of the adjacent street this monument is taller than the obelisks around the capitals of europe and in egypt and ethiopia but ordinary antique obelisks were quarried as a monolithic block of stone and were therefore seldom taller than approximately feet m the washington monument attracted enormous crowds before it officially opened for six months after its dedication people climbed the steps and large landings to the top after the elevator that had been used to raise building materials was altered to carry passengers the number of visitors grew rapidly and an average of people per month were going to the top by only three years after its completion and dedication the annual visitor count peaked at an average of million people between and from to when restrictions were placed on the number of visitors allowed per day the washington monument had an annual average of visitors as with all historic areas administered by the national park service an agency of the u s department of the interior the national memorial was listed on the national register of historic places on october in the early s material started oozing out between the outer stones of the first construction period below the foot m mark and was referred to by tourists as geological tuberculosis this was caused by the weathering of the cement and rubble filler between the outer and inner walls as the lower section of the monument was exposed to cold and hot and damp and dry weather conditions the material dissolved and worked its way through the cracks between the stones of the outer wall solidifying as it dripped down their outer surface for ten hours in december the washington monument and eight tourists were held hostage by a nuclear arms protester norman mayer claiming to have explosives in a van he drove to the monument s base united states park police shot and killed mayer the monument was undamaged in the incident and it was discovered later that mayer did not have explosives after this incident the surrounding grounds were modified in places to restrict the possible unauthorized approach of motor vehicles the monument underwent an extensive restoration project between the years of and during this time it was completely covered in scaffolding designed by the american architect michael graves who was also responsible for the interior changes the project included cleaning repairing and repointing the monument s exterior and interior stonework the stone in publicly accessible interior spaces was encased in glass to prevent vandalism while new windows with narrower frames were installed to increase the viewing space new exhibits celebrating the life of george washington and the monument s place in history were also added a temporary interactive visitor center dubbed the discovery channel center was also constructed during the project the center provided a simulated ride to the top of the monument and shared information with visitors during phases in which the monument was closed the majority of the project s phases were completed by summer allowing the monument to reopen july the monument temporarily closed again on december to allow a new elevator cab to be installed completing the final phase of the restoration project the new cab included glass windows allowing visitors to see some of the memorial stones with their inscriptions embedded in the monument s walls the installation of the cab took much longer than anticipated and the monument did not reopen until february the final cost of the restoration project was million on september the monument closed for a million renovation which included numerous security upgrades and redesign of the monument grounds by landscape architect laurie olin b the renovations were due partly to security concerns following the september attacks and the start of the war on terror the monument reopened april while the surrounding grounds remained closed until the landscape was finished later that summer on august the washington monument sustained damage during the magnitude virginia earthquake over cracks were found in the monument a national park service spokesperson reported that inspectors discovered a crack near the top of the structure and announced that the monument would be closed indefinitely a block in the pyramidion also was partially dislodged and pieces of stone stone chips mortar and paint chips came free of the monument and littered the interior stairs and observation deck the park service said it was bringing in two structural engineering firms wiss janney elstner associates inc and tipping mar associates with extensive experience in historic buildings and earthquake damaged structures to assess the monument officials said an examination of the monument s exterior revealed a debris field of mortar and pieces of stone around the base of the monument and several substantial pieces of stone had fallen inside the memorial a crack in the central stone of the west face of the pyramidion was inch cm wide and feet m long park service inspectors also discovered that the elevator system had been damaged and was operating only to the foot m level but was soon repaired on september denali national park ranger brandon latham arrived to assist four climbers belonging to a difficult access team from wiss janney elstner associates the reason for the inspection was the park agency s suspicion that there were more cracks on the monument s upper section not visible from the inside the agency said it filled the cracks that occurred on august after hurricane irene hit the area on august water was discovered inside the memorial leading the park service to suspect there was more undiscovered damage the rappellers used radios to report what they found to engineering experts on the ground wiss janney elstner climber dave megerle took three hours to set up the rappelling equipment and set up a barrier around the monument s lightning rod system atop the pyramidion it was the first time the hatch in the pyramidion had been open since the external inspection of the monument was completed on october in addition to the foot m long west crack the inspection found several corner cracks and surface spalls pieces of stone broken loose at or near the top of the monument and more loss of joint mortar lower down the monument the full report was issued in december bob vogel superintendent of the national mall and memorial parks emphasized that the monument was not in danger of collapse it s structurally sound and not going anywhere he told the national media at a press conference on september more than was spent between august and september inspecting the structure the national park service said that it would soon begin sealing the exterior cracks on the monument to protect it from rain and snow on july the national park service announced that the monument would be closed for repairs until the national park service hired construction management firm hill international in conjunction with joint venture partner louis berger group to provide coordination between the designer wiss janney and elstner associates the general contractor perini and numerous stakeholders nps said a portion of the plaza at the base of the monument would be removed and scaffolding constructed around the exterior in july lighting was added to the scaffolding some stone pieces saved during the inspection would be refastened to the monument while dutchman patches h would be used in other places several of the stone lips that help hold the pyramidion s pound kg exterior slabs in place were also damaged so engineers installed stainless steel brackets to more securely fasten them to the monument the national park service reopened the washington monument to visitors on may eight days ahead of schedule repairs to the monument cost million with taxpayers funding million of the cost and david rubenstein funding the other million at the reopening interior secretary sally jewell today show weatherman al roker and american idol season winner candice glover were present the monument continued to be plagued by problems after the earthquake including in january when the lights illuminating it went out the monument was closed again in september due to reliability issues with the elevator system on december the national park service announced that the monument would be closed until in order to modernize the elevator the million project was to correct the elevator s ongoing mechanical electrical and computer issues which had shuttered the monument since august the national park service requested funding in its fy president s budget request to construct a permanent screening facility for the washington monument the final months of closure were for mitigation of possibly contaminated underground soil thought to have been introduced in the s the monument reopened september after reopening in september the washington monument was closed on march with the onslaught of the covid pandemic it reopened on october and remained open through the remainder of that year except for brief closures on january a few days after the storming of the united states capitol the national park service announced a two week closure of the monument until after the presidential inauguration due to credible threats to visitors and park resources following a lack of violence the closure was extended due to a revival of covid fears the monument then reopened on july only to close yet again on august for two weeks due to lightning strikes which damaged some electrical systems this occurred just a week before the th anniversary of the august earthquake and highlighted a decade when the monument was closed more than it was open on september the monument was closed for one evening because a man was defacing the monument with red paint and graffiti have u been fucked by this with an arrow pointing upward and gov says tough shit in red lettering at west facing ground level he was arrested and charged with vandalism but pleaded not guilty in court the cornerstone was laid with great ceremony at the northeast corner of the lowest course or step of the old foundation on july robert mills the architect of the monument stated in september the foundations are now brought up nearly to the surface of the ground the second step being nearly completed which covers up the corner stone therefore the cornerstone was laid below the ground level in the ground level was raised feet m to the base of the shaft by the addition of a foot m wide earthen embankment encircling the reinforced foundation widened another feet in and then the knoll was constructed in b b if the cornerstone was not moved during the strengthening of the foundation in its upper surface would now be feet m below the pavement just outside the northeast corner of the shaft it would now be sandwiched between the concrete slab under the old foundation and the concrete buttress completely encircling what remains of the old foundation during the strengthening process about half by volume of the periphery of the lowest seven of eight courses or steps of the old foundation gneiss rubble was removed to provide good footing for the buttress although a few diagrams pictures and descriptions of this process exist the fate of the cornerstone is not mentioned b b figs the cornerstone was a pound kg marble block feet m high and feet m square with a large hole for a zinc case filled with memorabilia the hole was covered by a copper plate inscribed with the date of the declaration of independence july the date the cornerstone was laid july and the names of the managers of the washington national monument society the memorabilia in the zinc case included items associated with the monument the city of washington the national government state governments benevolent societies and george washington plus miscellaneous publications both governmental and commercial a coin set and a bible totaling items or collections of items as well as newspapers containing articles relating to george washington or the monument app c pp the ceremony began with a parade of dignitaries in carriages marching troops fire companies and benevolent societies chp a long oration was delivered by the speaker of the house of representatives robert c winthrop then the cornerstone was pronounced sound after a masonic ceremony using george washington s masonic gavel apron and sash as well as other masonic symbols in attendance were president james k polk and other federal state and local government officials elizabeth schuyler hamilton mrs dolley madison mrs john quincy adams and george washington parke custis among to others including a bald eagle the ceremony ended with fireworks that evening states cities foreign countries benevolent societies other organizations and individuals have contributed memorial stones all inserted into the east and west interior walls above stair landings or levels for easy viewing except one on the south interior wall between stairs that is difficult to view the sources disagree on the number of stones for two reasons whether one or both height stones are included and stones not yet on display at the time of a source s publication cannot be included the height stones refer to two stones that indicate height during the first phase of construction a stone with an inscription that includes the phrase from the foundation to this height feet m was installed just below the foot m stairway and high above the foot m stairway sheet during the second phase of construction a stone with a horizontal line and the phrase top of statue on capitol was installed on the foot m level sheet the historic structure report hsr named memorial stones by level including both height stones on jacob described in detail and pictured commemorative stones including the foot m stone but not the capitol stone on the historic american buildings survey habs showed the location of memorial stones but did not describe or name any habs showed both height stones but did not show one stone not yet installed in sheets olszewski named memorial stones by level including the capitol stone but not the foot stone olszewski did not include three stones not yet installed in chp app d in chp of stones are marble are granite are limestone are sandstone with miscellaneous types including stones with two types of material and those whose materials are not identified i unusual materials include native copper michigan pipestone minnesota petrified wood arizona and jadeite alaska the stones vary in size from about feet m square carthage j to about by feet m m philadelphia and new york city utah contributed one stone as a territory and another as a state both with inscriptions that include its pre territorial name deseret both located on the foot m level a stone at the foot m level of the monument is inscribed in welsh fy iaith fy ngwlad fy nghenedl cymry am byth my language my country my nation welsh forever the stone imported from wales was donated by welsh citizens of new york two other stones were presented by the sunday schools of the methodist episcopal church in new york and the sabbath school children of the methodist episcopal church in philadelphia the former quotes from the bible verse proverbs the memory of the just is blessed ottoman sultan abdul mejid i donated toward the construction of the washington monument the sultans donation was the largest single donation toward the building of the washington monument the sultan s intention was to bridge peace between the ottomans and the americans the stone containing the turkish inscriptions commemorating this event is on the foot m level the translation of the inscriptions state to support the continuation of true friendship abdul mejid khan s clear and pure name was written on the lofty stone in washington it combines the works of two eminent calligraphers an imperial tughra by mustafa rak m s student ha im efendi and an inscription in jal ta l q script by kazasker mustafa izzet efendi the calligrapher who wrote the giant medallions at hagia sophia in istanbul one stone was donated by the ryukyu kingdom and brought back by commodore matthew c perry but never arrived in washington it was replaced in many of the stones donated for the monument carried inscriptions that did not commemorate george washington for example one from the templars of honor and temperance stated we will not make buy sell or use as a beverage any spiritous or malt liquors wine cider or any other alcoholic liquor george washington himself had owned a whiskey distillery which operated at mount vernon after he left the presidency the aluminum apex composed of a metal that at the time was as rare and valuable as silver was cast by william frishmuth of philadelphia at the time of casting it was the largest piece of aluminum in the world before the installation it was put on public display at tiffany s in new york city and stepped over by visitors who could say they had stepped over the top of the washington monument it was inches cm tall before inch cm was vaporized from its tip by lightning strikes during when it was protected from further damage by tall lightning rods surrounding it its base is inches cm square the angle between opposite sides at its tip is it weighed ounces kg before lightning strikes removed a small amount of aluminum from its tip and sides spectral analysis in showed that it was composed of aluminum with the rest impurities it has a shallow depression in its base to match a slightly raised area atop the small upper surface of the marble capstone which aligns the sides of the apex with those of the capstone and the downward protruding lip around that area prevents water from entering the joint it has a large hole in the center of its base to receive a threaded inch cm diameter copper rod which attaches it to the monument and used to form part of the lightning protection system in the national geodetic survey reported the coordinates of the mm dimple atop the aluminum apex as n w n w wgs the four faces of the external aluminum apex all bear inscriptions in cursive writing snell round hand which are incised into the aluminum the apex was inscribed on site after it was delivered most inscriptions are the original inscriptions except for the top three lines on the east face which were added in from to a wide gold plated copper band that held eight short lightning rods two per side but not at its corners covered most of the inscriptions which were damaged and illegible as shown in the accompanying picture made in a new band including eight long lightning rods one at each corner and one at the middle of each side was added in and removed and discarded in the inscriptions that it covered were still damaged and illegible in only the top four and bottom two lines of the north face the first and last lines of the west face the top four lines of the south face and the top three lines of the east face are still legible even though the inscriptions are no longer covered no attempt was made to repair them when the apex was accessible in the following table shows legible inscriptions in blue and illegible inscriptions in red no colors appear on the actual apex the inscriptions occupy the lower portions of triangles thus the inscribed upper lines are necessarily shorter than some lower lines although most printed sources harvey olszewski app c torres and the historic structure report refer to the original inscriptions the national geodetic survey refers to both the and inscriptions all sources print them according to their own editorial rules resulting in excessive capitalization harvey olszewski and ngs and inappropriate line breaks no printed source uses cursive writing although pictures of the apex clearly show that it was used for both the and inscriptions a replica displayed on the foot level uses totally different line breaks than those on the external apex it also omits the inscriptions in october it was discovered that the display of this replica was positioned so that the laus deo latin for praise be to god inscription could not be seen and laus deo was omitted from the placard describing the apex the national park service rectified the omission by creating a new display the pyramidion the pointed top feet m of the monument was originally designed with an inch cm tall inscribed aluminum apex which served as a single lightning rod installed december six months later on june lightning damaged the marble blocks of the pyramidion so a net of gold plated copper rods supporting inch cm gold plated platinum tipped copper points spaced every feet m was installed over the entire pyramidion figs chp the original net included a gold plated copper band attached to the aluminum apex by four large set screws which supported eight closely spaced vertical points that did not protrude above the apex in these eight short points were lengthened to extend them above the apex by inches cm in this original system was removed and discarded it was replaced by only two thick solid aluminum lightning rods protruding above the tip of the apex by about one foot m attached to the east and west sides of the marble capstone just below the apex until it was removed the original lightning protection system was connected to the tops of the four iron columns supporting the elevator with large copper rods even though the aluminum apex is still connected to the columns with large copper rods it is no longer part of the lightning protection system because it is now disconnected from the present lightning rods which shield it the two lightning rods present since are connected to the iron columns with two large braided aluminum cables leading down the surface of the pyramidion near its southeast and northwest corners they enter the pyramidion at its base where they are tied together electrically shorted via large braided aluminum cables encircling the pyramidion two feet m above its base the bottom of the iron columns are connected to ground water below the monument via four large copper rods that pass through a foot m square well half filled with sand in the center of the foundation the effectiveness of the lightning protection system has not been affected by a significant draw down of the water table since because the soil s water content remains roughly both above and below the height of the water table during the first phase of construction the walls were built with bluestone gneiss rubble ranging from very large irregular stones having a cross section of about by feet m m down to spalls broken pieces of stone all embedded in a large amount of mortar the outer surface is marble stones to inches cm thick in foot cm high courses or rows horizontally encircling the monument although each course contains both stretchers stones parallel to the wall and headers stones projecting into the wall about two to three times as many stretchers as headers were used their joints were so thin that some stones pressed on bare stone below them breaking off many pieces since it was constructed the batter or slope of the outer surface is inches per foot cm m the inner surface has disorderly rows of smaller roughly dressed bluestone gneiss b sheets the base of the first phase walls has an outer dimension of feet inches m square and a thickness of feet m the interior well is feet inch m square and has square corners the weight of the first phase walls up to feet m is long tons short tons tonnes during the second phase the walls were constructed of smoothly dressed ashlar large marble and granite blocks rectangular cuboids laid down in an orderly manner flemish bond with thick joints two foot high marble surface stones using an equal number of stretchers and headers were backed by granite blocks from the foot level the first course above the rubble to the foot level where marble headers become increasingly visible on the internal surface of the walls up to the foot level above which only marble stones are used k between the and foot levels the inner walls rapidly slope outward increasing the shaft well from feet inch square to feet inches m square with a corresponding decrease in the thickness of the walls and their weight sheets the second phase walls at the foot level were feet inches m thick which combined with the larger shaft well yields an outer dimension of feet inches m square at that level the top of the second phase walls are feet inches m square and foot inches cm thick the second phase interior walls have rounded corners foot m radii the weight of the second phase walls from feet to feet are long tons short tons tonnes the walls of the entire shaft combined first and second phases are feet inches m high the first phase of the walls was constructed under the direction of william dougherty its white cockeysville marble exterior came from the texas quarry now adjacent to and east of north i near the warren road exit in cockeysville maryland the quarry was named for the texas station no longer extant and th century town on the northern central railway during the first phase it was operated by thomas symington but is now operated by martin marietta materials and no longer produces building stone the second phase of construction was under the direction of lt col col thomas lincoln casey of the united states army corps of engineers who removed two defective courses added by the know nothings and the last foot course added by dougherty before casey began his construction the next three courses of white marble feet m came from sheffield massachusetts while all courses above them came from the beaver dam quarry just west of the th century town of cockeysville the latter quarry is located on beaver dam road near its intersection with mccormick road during the second phase the quarry was operated by hugh sisson but is now flooded is called beaverdam pond and is the home of the beaver dam swimming club both th century towns are now within the city limits of cockeysville the marble capstone of the pyramidion is a truncated pyramid with a cubical keystone projecting from its base and a deep groove surrounding the keystone the aluminum apex replaces its truncated top the inside upper edges of the topmost slabs on the four faces of the pyramidion rest on the keystone and in the groove it has a large vertical hole through which a inch cm threaded copper rod passes and screws into the base of the apex which used to form part of its lightning protection system the keystone and groove occupy so much of its base that only a small horizontal area near its outer edge remains the weight of the capstone is transferred to both the inner and outer portions of the shiplap upper edges of the slabs it weighs pounds kg is feet inches m high from its base to its top and is feet cm square at its base the marble pyramidion has an extremely complex construction to save weight yet remain strong its surface slabs or panels are usually only inches cm thick with small thick and thin portions and generally do not support the weight of slabs above them instead transferring their own weight via foot cm wide internal marble ribs to the shaft s walls the slabs are generally feet m wide and feet inches m high with a inch cm vertical overlap shiplap to prevent water from entering the horizontal joints twelve such courses the internal ribs the marble capstone and the aluminum apex comprise the pyramidion its height is feet inches m its weight is long tons short tons tonnes the slope of the walls of the pyramidion is from the vertical there are twelve ribs three per wall which spring from the foot m level all being integrated into the walls up to the foot m level all are free standing above feet relying on mortise and tenon joints to attach neighboring stones the eight corner ribs terminate six courses above the shaft each corner rib resting on its neighboring corner rib via a miter joint forming four corner arches each such arch supports a pair of square corner stones one above the other totaling one course in height each corner rib is linked to the nearest center rib at the sixth course via a marble tie beam the four center ribs terminate eight courses above the shaft at a marble cruciform cross shaped keystone forming two main arches that cross each other two stones each one course high are mounted on each of the four ribs supporting two additional courses above the cruciform keystone leaving two courses to support the capstone s weight by themselves the observation floor nominally the foot level is feet inches m above the entry lobby floor or lowest landing level it is inches cm above the marble base of the pyramidion and the top of the shaft walls sheet four pairs of foot cm wide observation windows are provided spaced feet cm apart inner stone edge to edge all just above the lowest course of slabs foot level six are foot inches cm high while two on the east face are feet cm high for easier egress all were originally provided with thin marble shutters in a bronze frame each of which could be opened inward one left and the other right per wall after two people committed suicide by jumping through the open windows in the s hinged horizontal iron bars were added to them in a ninth opening in a slab on the south face just below the capstone is provided for access to the outside of the pyramidion it is covered by a stone slab which is internally removable in four red aircraft warning lights were installed one per face in one of its observation windows pilots complained that they could not be easily seen so the monument was floodlit on all sides as well b b b b in eight inch cm diameter holes for new red aircraft warning lights were bored one above each window near the top edge of the fourth course of slabs foot level in the pyramidion b sheet in the observation windows were glazed with shatterproof glass in they were glazed with bulletproof glass and the shutters removed new bulletproof glass was installed during b the pyramidion has two inscriptions neither of which is regarded as a memorial stone one is the year on the underside of the cruciform keystone the other is at the same level as that keystone on the north face of the west center rib containing the names and titles of the four highest ranked builders its inscription chief engineer is almost identical to the inscription on the south face of the aluminum apex except for u s which is part of the phrase th u s infantry in the inscription inside the pyramidion but the apex has only th infantry additionally the internal inscription does not use cursive writing and all letters in all names are capitals sheet the first phase began with the excavation of about feet inches m of topsoil down to a level of loam consisting of equal parts of sand and clay hard enough to require picks to break it up on this bed of the foundation the cornerstone was laid at the northeast corner of the proposed foundation the rest of the foundation was then constructed of bluestone gneiss rubble and spalls with every crevice filled with lime mortar the dimensions of this old foundation were feet inches m high feet m square at the base and feet inches m square at the top laid down in eight steps similar to a truncated step pyramid at the center of the foundation a brick lined foot cm square well was dug to a depth of feet m below the bed of the foundation to keep it dry and to supply water during construction during the second phase after determining that the proposed weight of the monument was too great for the old foundation to safely bear the thickness of the walls atop the unfinished stump was reduced and the foundation was strengthened by adding a large unreinforced concrete slab below the perimeter of the old foundation to increase the monument s load bearing area two and one half times the slab was feet inches m thick with an outer perimeter feet inches m square an inner perimeter feet m square with undisturbed loam inside the inner perimeter except for the water well the area at the base of the second phase foundation is square feet m the strengthened foundation old foundation and concrete slab has a total depth of feet inches m below the bottom of the lowest course of marble blocks now below ground and feet m below the entry lobby floor casey reported that nowhere did the load exceed long tons per square foot psi kpa and did not exceed long tons per square foot psi kpa near the outer perimeter to properly distribute the load from the shaft to slab about half by volume of the outer periphery of the old rubble foundation below its top step was removed a continuous sloping unreinforced concrete buttress encircles what remains the buttress is feet inches m square at its base feet inches m square at its top and feet inches m high the perimeter of the original top step of the old rubble foundation rests on the larger top of the concrete buttress its slope lower external angle from the vertical is this buttress rests in a depression triangular cross section on the top surface of the concrete slab the slab was constructed by digging pairs of foot m wide drifts on opposite sides of the monument s center line to keep the monument properly balanced the drifts were filled with unreinforced concrete with depressions or dowel stones on their sides to interlock the sections figs an earthen terrace feet m wide with its top at the base of the walls and steep sides was constructed in over the reinforced foundation while the rest of the monument was being constructed during a knoll was constructed around the terrace tapering out roughly feet m onto the surrounding terrain this earthen terrace and knoll serves as an additional buttress for the foundation the weight of the foundation is long tons short tons tonnes including earth and gneiss rubble above the concrete foundation that is within its outer perimeter the monument is filled with ironwork consisting of its stairs elevator columns and associated tie beams none of which supports the weight of the stonework it was redesigned in to reduce congestion and improve the flow of visitors originally visitors entered and exited the west side of the elevator on the observation floor causing congestion so the large landing at the foot level was expanded to a full floor and the original spiral stair in the northeast corner between the and foot and m levels was replaced by two spiral stairs in the northeast and southeast corners now visitors exit the elevator on the observation floor then walk down either spiral stair before reboarding the elevator for their trip back down fig the main stairs spiral up the interior walls from the entry lobby floor to the elevator reboarding floor at the foot m level the elevator occupies the center of the shaft well from the entry lobby to the observation floor with an elevator machine room installed whose floor is feet inches m above the observation floor and an elevator pit excavated whose floor is feet m below the entry lobby floor sheet the stairs and elevator are supported by four wrought iron columns each the four supporting the stairs extend from the entry lobby floor to the observation floor and were set at the corners of a foot inch m square the four supporting the elevator extend from the floor of the elevator pit to feet m above the observation floor and were set at the corners of a foot inch m square the weight of the ironwork is long tons short tons tonnes cast iron wrought iron and steel were all used the two small spiral stairs installed in are aluminum most landings occupy the entire east and west interior walls every feet m from and including the east landing at the foot m level up to the west landing at the foot m level east then west alternately three stairs with small landings rise from the entry lobby floor to the foot m level successively along the north west and south interior walls landings from the foot m level up to the foot m level are feet inches m by feet inch m while landings from the foot m level to the foot m level are feet inches m by feet inches m all stairs are on the north and south walls except for the aforementioned west stair between the foot m levels and the two spiral stairs citation needed about one fourth of visitors chose to ascend the monument using the stairs when they were available they were closed to up traffic in and then closed to all traffic except by special arrangement in the stairs had steps until consisting of risers in each of the main stairs plus risers in the spiral stair chp since the stairs have had risers if only one spiral stair is counted because both spiral stairs now have risers each sheets these figures do not include two additional steps in the entry passage that were covered up in by a ramp and its inward horizontal extension to meet the higher since entry lobby floor one step was feet m away from the outer walls and the other was at the end of the passage feet m away from the outer walls figs as initially constructed the interior was relatively open with two rail handrails but a couple of suicides and an accidental fall prompted the addition of tall wire screening feet m high with a large diamond mesh on the inside edge of the stairs and landings in the original steam powered elevator which took to minutes to ascend to the observation floor was replaced by an electric elevator powered by an on site dynamo in which took five minutes to ascend the monument was connected to the electrical grid in allowing the installation of a modern electric elevator in which took seconds the latter was replaced in and again in by second elevators b b b from to the wire screening at three platforms was replaced by large glass panels to allow visitors on the elevator to view three clusters of memorial stones that were synchronously lit as the elevator automatically slowed while passing them during its descent fifty american flags not state flags one for each state are now flown hours a day around a large circle centered on the monument forty eight american flags one for each state then in existence were flown on wooden flag poles on washington s birthday since and later on independence day memorial day and other special occasions until early both the flags and flag poles were removed and stored between these days in fifty foot m tall aluminum flag poles anticipating alaska and hawaii were installed evenly spaced around a foot m diameter circle during the diameter of the circle was reduced to feet m since washington s birthday american flags were flown on a daily basis increasing to flags on july and then to flags since july when and flags were flown only and flag poles of the available were placed into base receptacles all flags were removed and stored overnight since july american flags have flown hours a day b b sheet in the grounds renovation two large circles were added to the landscaping with the obelisk in the intersection or vesica piscis the monument s vesica piscis is not ideal because neither circle passes through the center of its neighbor furthermore both circles are slightly elliptical the total cost of the monument from to was equivalent to in the weight of the above ground portion of the monument is long tons short tons tonnes whereas its total weight including the foundation below ground and any earth above it that is within its outer perimeter is long tons short tons tonnes the total number of blocks in the monument including all marble granite and gneiss blocks whether externally or internally visible or hidden from view within the walls or old foundation is over the number of marble blocks externally visible is about the monument stands feet inches m tall according to the national geodetic survey measured or feet inches m tall according to the national park service measured b in a ramp covered two steps at the entrance to the monument so the ground next to the ramp was raised to match its height reducing the remaining height to the monument s apex it is both the world s tallest predominantly stone structure and the world s tallest obelisk it is the tallest monumental column in the world if all are measured above their pedestrian entrances but two are taller when measured above ground though they are neither all stone nor true obelisks a the tallest masonry structure in the world is the brick anaconda smelter stack in montana at feet inches m tall but this includes a foot m non masonry concrete foundation leaving the stack s brick chimney at feet inches m tall only about inches cm taller than the monument s height if the monument s aluminum apex is also discounted then the stack s masonry portion is inches cm taller than the monument s masonry portion b l in a temporary visitor security screening center was added to the east entrance of the washington monument in the wake of the september attacks the one story facility was designed to reduce the ability of a terrorist attack on the interior of the monument or an attempt to seize and hold it visitors obtained their timed entry tickets from the monument lodge east of the memorial and passed through metal detectors and bomb sniffing sensors prior to entering the monument after exiting the monument they passed through a turnstile to prevent them from re entering this facility a one story cube of wood around a metal frame was intended to be temporary until a new screening facility could be designed on march the national capital planning commission approved a new visitor screening facility to replace the temporary one the square foot m facility will be two stories high and contain space for screening to visitors at a time the exterior walls which will be slightly frosted to prevent viewing of the security screening process will consist of an outer sheet of bulletproof glass or polycarbonate a metal mesh insert and another sheet of bulletproof glass the inner sheet will consist of two sheets slightly separated of laminated glass a inch cm airspace will exist between the inner and outer glass walls to help insulate the facility two possibly three geothermal heat pumps will be built on the north side of the monument to provide heating and cooling of the facility the new facility will also provide an office for national park service and united states park police staff the structure is designed so that it may be removed without damaging the monument the united states commission of fine arts approved the aesthetic design of the screening facility in june a recessed trench wall known as a ha ha has been built to minimize the visual impact of a security barrier surrounding the monument after the september attacks and another unrelated terror threat at the monument authorities had put up a circle of temporary jersey barriers to prevent large motor vehicles from approaching the unsightly barrier was replaced by a less obtrusive low inch cm granite stone wall that doubles as a seating bench and also incorporates lighting the installation received the park landscape award of merit from the american society of landscape architects the washington monument is served by federal triangle metro

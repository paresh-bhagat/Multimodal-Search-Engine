empire arose from the ruins of the kampili kingdom it grew into one of the famed hindu empires of south india that ruled for over years the vijayanagara empire built its capital around hampi calling it vijayanagara many historians propose that harihara i and bukka i the founders of the empire were commanders in the army of the hoysala empire stationed in the tungabhadra region to ward off muslim invasions from the northern india some claim that they were telugu people who took control of the northern parts of the hoysala empire during its decline as per some of the texts such as vidyaranya kalajana vidyaranya vritanta rajakalanirnaya pitamahasamhita sivatatvaratnakara they were treasury officers of pratap rudra the king of kakatiya kingdom when muhammad bin tughlaq came looking for baha ud din gurshasp who was taking refuge in the court of pratap rudra pratap rudra was overthrown and kakatiya was destroyed during this time the two brothers harihara i and bukka i with a small army came to the present site of vijayanagara hampi vidyaranya the th jagadguru of the ringeri arada p tham took them under his protection and established them on the throne and the city was called vidyanagara in a d they expanded the infrastructure and temples according to nicholas gier and other scholars by ce hampi vijayanagara was the world s second largest medieval era city after beijing

pursuits and the arts maintained a strong military and fought many wars with sultanates to its north and east they invested in roads waterworks agriculture religious buildings and public infrastructure this included states unesco forts riverside features royal and sacred complexes temples shrines pillared halls mandapas halls for people to sit memorial structures gateways check posts stables water structures and more the site was multi religious and multi ethnic it included hindu and jain monuments next to each other the buildings predominantly followed south indian hindu arts and architecture dating to the aihole pattadakal styles but the hampi builders also used elements of indian architecture in the lotus mahal the public bath and the elephant stables according to historical memoirs left by portuguese and persian traders to hampi the city was of metropolitan proportions they called it one of the most beautiful cities while prosperous and in infrastructure the muslim hindu wars between muslim sultanates and vijayanagara empire continued in at the battle of talikota a coalition of muslim sultanates entered into a war with the vijayanagara empire they captured and beheaded the king aliya rama raya followed by a massive destruction of the infrastructure fabric of hampi and the metropolitan vijayanagara the city was pillaged looted and burnt for six months after the war then abandoned as ruins which are now called the group of monuments at hampi note hampi and its nearby region remained a contested and fought over region claimed by the local chiefs the hyderabad muslim nizams the maratha hindu kings and hyder ali and his son tipu sultan of mysore through the th century in tipu sultan was defeated and killed when the british forces and wadiyar dynasty aligned the region then came under british influence the ruins of hampi were surveyed in by scottish colonel colin mackenzie first surveyor general of india mackenzie wrote that the hampi site was abandoned and only wildlife live there the th century speculative articles by historians who followed mackenzie blamed the th century armies of haidar ali and the marathas for the damage to the hampi monuments the hampi site remained largely ignored until the mid th century when alexander greenlaw visited and photographed the site in he created an archive of calotype photographs of temples and royal structures that were standing in these photographs were held in a private collection in the united kingdom and were not published until they are the most valuable source of the mid th century state of hampi monuments to scholars a translation of the memoirs written by abdul razzaq a persian envoy in the court of devaraya ii published in the early s described some monuments of the abandoned site this translation for the first time uses arabic terms such as zenana to describe some of the hampi monuments some of these terms became the names thereafter alexander rea an officer of the archaeological survey department of the madras presidency within british india published his survey of the site in robert sewell published his scholarly treatise a forgotten empire in bringing hampi to the widespread attention of scholars the growing interest led rea and his successor longhurst to clear and repair the hampi group of monuments the site is significant historically and archaeologically for the vijayanagara period and before the archaeological survey of india continues to conduct excavations in the area view of hampi bazaar from matanga hill entrance to sri krishna temple temple on top of matanga hill jpg sasivekalu ganesha monument hampi is located in hilly terrain formed by granite boulders the hampi monuments comprising the unesco world heritage site are a subset of the wider spread vijayanagara ruins almost all of the monuments were built between and ce during the vijayanagara rule the site has about monuments and covers square kilometres sq mi the hampi site has been studied in three broad zones the first has been named the sacred centre by scholars such as burton stein and othersl the second is referred to as the urban core or the royal centre and the third constitutes the rest of metropolitan vijayanagara the sacred centre alongside the river contains the oldest temples with a history of pilgrimage and monuments pre dating the vijayanagara empire the urban core and royal centre have over sixty ruined temples beyond those in the sacred centre but the temples in the urban core are all dated to the vijayanagara empire the urban core also includes public utility infrastructure such as roads an aqueduct water tanks mandapa gateways and markets monasteries note this distinction has been assisted by some seventy seven stone inscriptions most of the monuments are hindu the temples and the public infrastructure such as tanks and markets include reliefs and artwork depicting hindu deities and themes from hindu texts there are also six jain temples and monuments and a muslim mosque and tomb the architecture is built from the abundant local stone the dominant style is dravidian with roots in the developments in hindu arts and architecture in the second half of the st millennium in the deccan region it also included elements of the arts that developed during the hoysala empire rule in the south between the th and th century such as in the pillars of ramachandra temple and ceilings of some of the virupaksha temple complex note the architects also adopted an indo islamic style in a few monuments such as the queen s bath and elephant stables which unesco says reflects a highly evolved multi religious and multi ethnic society virupaksha temple at hampi ruins of vijaya vittala temple gopuram of virupaksha temple the virupaksha temple is the oldest shrine the principal destination for pilgrims and tourists and remains an active hindu worship site parts of the shiva pampa and durga temples existed in the th century

courtyard after the small gopuram has dipa stambha lamp pillar and nandi the courtyard after the small gopuram leads to the main mandapa of the shiva temple which consists of the original square mandapa and a rectangular extension composed of two fused squares and sixteen piers built by krishnadevaraya the ceiling of the open hall above the mandapa is painted showing the shaivism legend relating to shiva parvati marriage another section shows the legend of rama sita of the vaishnavism tradition a third section depicts the legend of the love god kama shooting an arrow at shiva to get him interested in parvati and the fourth section shows the advaita hindu scholar vidyaranya being carried in a procession according to george michell and other scholars the details and colour hues suggest all the ceiling paintings are from a th century renovation and the themes of the original paintings are unknown the mandapa pillars have outsized yalis mythical animal melding the features of a horse lion and other animals with an armed warrior riding it a characteristic vijayanagara feature the sanctum of the temple has a mukha linga a shiva linga with a face embossed with brass the

orders of the british india officer f w robinson who sought to restore the virupaksha temple complex whitewashing of this cluster of historic monuments has continued as a tradition according to local tradition the virupaksha is the only temple that continued to be a gathering place of hindus and frequented by pilgrims after the destruction of hampi in the temple attracts large crowds an annual f te with a chariot procession to mark the marriage of virupaksha and pampa is held in spring as is the solemn festival of maha shivaratri the temple has attracted criticism from tourists for its

sophisticated hindu temple in hampi and is part of the sacred centre of vijayanagara it is unclear when the temple complex was built and who built it most scholars date it to a period of construction in the early to mid th century some of the books mention that its construction began during the time of devaraya ii and continued during the reign of krishnadevaraya achuytaraya and probably sadasivaraya and it stopped probably due to the destruction of the city in the inscriptions include male and female names suggesting that the complex was built by multiple sponsors the temple was

towers shikaras on these are pyramidal granite structures consisting of eleven stacked shrinking squares and a top in the deccan style square kalasha finial both sets are shiva temples with triple linga early sources misidentified these as jain temples because of their simple exterior and interior walls one of these groups has a historically important inscription that records that kampila built the monument in the early th century this inscription links hampi with the kampili kingdom and suggests an association of the kampili history with that of vijayanagara empire that followed it the style of temples on the hemakuta hill suggest it may have been a study centre for experimenting with different types of hindu temples the styles present include those of the chalukya period the rashtrakuta period and later periods it may also have been the template for the original virupaksha temple which was later greatly expanded with gopuram mandala and other additions a similar monument dedicated to narasimha the man lion avatar of vishnu is located east of hampi an inscription near it states that it was operating in ce the hemakuta hill also has monuments with two monolithic ganesha

monument near the step tank the square water pavilion also called the queen s bath is in the south east of the royal centre it has a pavilion a water basin and a method of moving fresh water to it and taking away wash water and overflows the basin is enclosed within an ornate pillared vaulted bay nearby are ruins of the aqueduct the modern name of this building the queen s bath is probably a misnomer because this was a public bath for men and travellers the building s interior arches show influence of the indo islamic style reflecting an era in which hindu and muslim arts influenced each other in india the vijayanagara empire built an extensive water infrastructure some examples of which including the manmatha tank near virupaksha temple which is dated to about the th century predates the vijayanagara according to an inscription found there the manmatha tank was upgraded and a durga shrine added in ce the inclusion of artwork at the tank such as a warrior fighting a lion is dated to the th century when hoysalas frequented hampi the hampi monuments include aqueducts to carry water to tanks and other parts of the city as well as drains and channels to remove water overflow excavations in the s near the mahanavami platform in the urban core revealed a large square stepped tank that was fed by an aqueduct the tanks were public utilities some were perhaps used for royal ceremonies archaeological excavations in revealed twenty three wells and cisterns in the hampi vijayanagara metropolis of these thirteen were found outside the city walls in the suburbs and ten inside of these were twelve at roadsides eight near temples ten in residential areas and two were used for irrigation within the urban core more water structures were found in daroji valley for agriculture according to archaeologists kathleen morrison and carla sinopoli the hampi water infrastructure was for the use of travellers rituals domestic use and irrigation several major temples in hampi have an embedded kitchen and or more pillared feeding halls hampi also had a dedicated public bhojana shala house of food where numerous thali dish were carved in series in a rock on both sides of a water channel one example is found near an octagonal fountain in the south of the royal centre according to epigraphical sources this hampi bhojan shala was a utada kaluve or canal connected with eating in the east of the royal centre lies the gajashala or elephant stables which consist of eleven square chambers aligned north south the openings to the stables are arched above ten chambers are alternating fluted and plain domes in the middle of the stables are stairs to reach the roof the enclosure is close to the elephant stables it was thus named in a persian memoir whose th century translation was an early introduction to hampi ruins for many the enclosure contains the lotus mahal the latter being a two storeyed pavilion in the royal centre the lotus mahal combines a symmetrical square hindu mandala design with lobed arches vaults and domes of the indo islamic style its basement and pyramidal towers are based on hindu temple architecture like almost all of the structures in hampi s royal centre this monument has no inscriptions nor epigraphs mentioning it and therefore dating it and establishing its function with evidence has been difficult the lotus mahal and other structures in the hampi urban core however were not built with muslim patronage unlike the tombs in the various muslim quarters of the city these buildings reflect the assimilative approach of the vijayanagara hindu rulers lotus mahal looks like a syncretic congested space and its purpose is unclear speculations include it being a council hall in the sacred centre near the southern banks of the tungabhadra river and close to the vitthala temple complex are gateways and a monument now called the king s balance the latter is similar to those found at the entrances of south indian hindu temples for the tula purush d na or thulabharam ceremonies in which a person gives a gift by weight equal to or greater than their body weight the vijayanagara rulers built forts fortified gateways and watchtowers after their dynasty was founded from the ruins of war and for security from repeated raids and invasion hindu style corbelled arches are the most common gateways and watchtowers in hampi note one such gateway is located south east of ganagitti jain temple it incorporate a central barbican wall designed to entrap and confuse a stranger aiming for a surprise while frequent visitors knew

hampi site includes a muslim quarter with islamic tombs two mosques and a cemetery these are neither in the sacred centre nor in the royal centre of the hampi site some muslim monuments are a part of the urban core while others are in the suburbs where most vijayanagara residents lived these are in the north east valley of the urban core where settlements of hindus and jains are also found much of this region is deeply silted and the soil conceals abandoned temples roads water tanks gateways and residential quarters there is a muslim monument in the south east of the urban core on the road from

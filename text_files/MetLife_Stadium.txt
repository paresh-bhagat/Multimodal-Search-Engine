sports league after the polo grounds which was home to the baseball giants and yankees from to shea stadium which housed both the mets and yankees during the and seasons and both the jets and giants in and giants stadium which hosted both the giants and jets from to as giants stadium approached years of age it was becoming one of the older stadiums in the nfl the jets who had been the tenants to the giants were looking to have a proposed west side stadium built in manhattan proper originally intended to be the seat main stadium for new york s bid for the summer olympics it was designed to be downsized to seats for the jets however it would have required significant public funding progress on the project was halted in due to opposition from a number of sources including cablevision the jets then entered into a joint venture with the giants to build a new stadium in which the two new york teams would be equal partners the architects were tasked with designing a neutral stadium that would still embody the distinct personalities of both franchises the giants favored a traditional look of exposed steel framework and rusticated stone while the jets wanted a sleek and modern look highlighted by metal and glass with those features in mind the designers used the column tower dynamic seen in many of manhattan s skyscrapers as inspiration for the stadium s design the base of the stadium s facade is clad in limestone like stonework while the rest of the stadium is distinguished by an outer skin of aluminum louvers and glass and by interior lighting capable of switching colors depending on which team is currently playing blue for the giants and green for the jets this idea originated at the allianz arena in munich germany which was previously shared between the city s two major soccer clubs bayern munich and munich unlike giants stadium metlife stadium can easily be reconfigured for the giants or jets within a matter of hours the louvers total linear length is exactly meters kilometers or feet miles front row yard line seats are feet m away from the sideline which is the shortest distance of all nfl stadiums to change the field decorations two person crews take approximately hours using forklifts and other machinery to remove the sections of act global ubu speed series which make up the teams respective end zones unlike most nfl stadiums the nfl s logo is painted at midfield instead of the logo of one of the teams also shortening the transition time replaceable team logos at midfield were removed in august after domenik hixon tore his anterior cruciate ligament at a practice at the stadium during training camp if the two teams are playing each other the designated home team will have its configuration around the stadium during their annual preseason matchup both the giants and the jets will have an end zone with their team logo unlike a number of other new nfl venues metlife stadium does not have a roof as proposals to include a roof failed over a dispute for funding thus indoor events such as the final four cannot be held at the facility which runs counter to the original aims for a new arena in northern new jersey ten giant hd ready light emitting diode led pylons located at the north south east and west entrances display videos of the team currently in house the pylons measure approximately feet m high by feet m wide inside are four feet m by feet m hd video displays and hang from each corner of the upper deck the new stadium seating bowl is laid out similar to that of giants stadium and has seating for people including club seats and approximately luxury suites making it the largest nfl stadium in terms of total seating the seating bowl is also raked in a way that eliminates overhangs from the upper decks that would impede views and allows fans to see the full arc of a foot yd punt metlife stadium includes a total of four locker rooms one each for the giants and jets as well as two for visiting teams the home teams have locker rooms on opposite ends of the stadium with a visitors locker room adjacent to it on most game days the visitors use the locker room at the end opposite that of the home team while the unused visitors locker room is used for spillover by the home team for games in which neither the giants or jets are playing each team uses one of the visitor s locker rooms when the giants and jets play each other each team uses its own locker room plus the adjacent visitor s room for spillover in dlr group partnered with nrg energy to design and install a solar ring on the upper rim of metlife stadium the solar ring consists of building integrated photovoltaic bipv solar panels assembled into individual frames the bipv panels are illuminated with led lighting and programmed to display the signature blue and green colors of the giants and the jets along with other hues for events such as concerts soccer matches and college sports the panels generate about kw nearly times the amount of electricity that s actually needed to power the led display system the excess power generated can go into the general stadium use or back to the grid the two teams formed the new meadowlands stadium company llc now metlife stadium company a joint venture to build and operate the stadium the two teams leased the parcel of land on which the stadium stands from the njsea for a year term with options to extend it which could eventually reach years after the th year of the lease and every five years hence one of the two teams may opt out of the lease after giving the state months notice the first such opportunity to opt out will occur in with a notice date of there will then be an opportunity to opt out in etc however if one team leaves for a new stadium the other team would have to remain for the remainder of the lease however the high cost of building and relocating to a stadium makes it very unlikely the teams also get parking revenue from the meadowlands western parking lots year round even when there are no events at the stadium this would occur when other parts of the meadowlands host events allianz a financial services and insurance company based in munich germany expressed interest in purchasing naming rights to the stadium the proposal was for a period of up to years and was estimated to be valued at between million and us million however it sparked protests from new york s jewish community the largest outside of israel and the anti defamation league which opposed the move due to close ties in the past between allianz and the government of nazi germany during world war ii rabbi jay rosenbaum however secretary general of the north american board of rabbis agreed that although survivors sensibilities are understandable a naming deal is legitimate i have found allianz to be receptive to be sensitive and a friend of the jewish people today he said allianz sponsors the venue that inspired the color change technology for metlife stadium allianz

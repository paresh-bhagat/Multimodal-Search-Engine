 the erie canal is a historic canal in upstate new york that runs east west between the hudson river and lake erie completed in the canal was the first navigable waterway connecting the atlantic ocean to the great lakes vastly reducing the costs of transporting people and goods across the appalachians in effect the canal accelerated the settlement of the great lakes region the westward expansion of the united states and the economic ascendancy of new york state it has been called the nation s first superhighway a canal from the hudson to the great lakes was first proposed in the s but a formal survey was not conducted until the new york state legislature authorized construction in political opponents of the canal and of its lead supporter new york governor dewitt clinton denigrated the project as clinton s folly and clinton s big ditch nonetheless the canal saw quick success upon opening on october with toll revenue covering the state s construction debt within the first year of operation the westward connection gave new york city a strong advantage over all other u s ports and brought major growth to canal cities such as albany utica syracuse rochester and buffalo the construction of the erie canal was a landmark civil engineering achievement in the early history of the united states when built the mile km canal was the second longest in the world after the grand canal in china initially feet m wide and feet m deep the canal was expanded several times most notably from to when the barge canal was built and over half the original route was abandoned the modern barge canal measures miles km long feet m wide and feet m deep it has locks including the waterford flight the steepest locks in the united states when leaving the canal boats must also traverse the black rock lock to reach lake erie or the troy federal lock to reach the tidal hudson the overall elevation difference is about feet m the erie s peak year was when commercial shipments took place it continued to be competitive with railroads until about when tolls were abolished commercial traffic declined heavily in the latter half of the th century due to competition from trucking and the opening of the larger st lawrence seaway the canal s last regularly scheduled hauler the day peckinpaugh ended service in today the erie canal is mainly used by recreational watercraft it connects the three other canals in the new york state canal system the champlain oswego and cayuga seneca some long distance boaters take the erie as part of the great loop the canal has also become a tourist attraction in its own right a number of parks and museums are dedicated to its history the erie canalway trail is a popular cycling path that follows the canal across the state in congress designated the erie canalway national heritage corridor to protect and promote the system the waterway today referred to as the erie canal is quite different from the nineteenth century erie canal more than half of the original erie canal was destroyed or abandoned during construction of the new york state barge canal in the early th century the sections of the original route remaining in use were widened significantly mostly west of syracuse with bridges rebuilt and locks replaced it was called the barge canal at the time but that name fell into disuse with the disappearance of commercial traffic and the increase of recreational travel in the later th century prior to the advent of railroads water transport was the most cost effective way to ship bulk goods a mule can only carry about pounds kg but can draw a barge weighing as much as pounds kg along a towpath in total a canal could cut transport costs by about percent in the early years of the united states transportation of goods between the coastal ports and the interior was slow and difficult close to the seacoast rivers provided easy inland transport up to the fall line since floating vessels encounter much less friction than land vehicles however the appalachian mountains were a great obstacle to further transportation or settlement stretching miles km from maine to mississippi with just five places where mule trains or wagon roads could be routed passengers and freight bound for the western parts of the country had to travel overland a journey made more difficult by the rough condition of the roads in it typically took weeks to travel overland from new york to cleveland ohio miles km and weeks to detroit miles km the principal exportable product of the ohio valley was grain which was a high volume low priced commodity bolstered by supplies from the coast frequently it was not worth the cost of transporting it to far away population centers this was a factor leading to farmers in the west turning their grains into whiskey for easier transport and higher sales and later the whiskey rebellion in the th and early th centuries it became clear to coastal residents that the city or state that succeeded in developing a cheap reliable route to the west would enjoy economic success and the port at the seaward end of such a route would see business increase greatly in time projects were devised in virginia maryland pennsylvania and relatively deep into the coastal states the mohawk river a tributary of the hudson rises near lake ontario and runs in a glacial meltwater channel just north of the catskill range of the appalachian mountains separating them from the geologically distinct adirondacks to the north the mohawk and hudson valleys form the only cut across the appalachians north of alabama a navigable canal through the mohawk valley would allow an almost complete water route from new york city in the south to lake ontario and lake erie in the west via the canal and these lakes other great lakes and to a lesser degree related rivers a large part of the continent s interior and many settlements would be made well connected to the eastern seaboard the idea of a canal to tie the east coast to the new western settlements was discussed as early as new york provincial official cadwallader colden made a passing reference in a report on fur trading to improving the natural waterways of western new york gouverneur morris and elkanah watson were early proponents of a canal along the mohawk river their efforts led to the creation of the western and northern inland lock navigation companies in which took the first steps to improve navigation on the mohawk and construct a canal between the mohawk and lake ontario but it was soon discovered that private financing was insufficient christopher colles who was familiar with the bridgewater canal surveyed the mohawk valley and made a presentation to the new york state legislature in proposing a shorter canal from lake ontario the proposal drew attention and some action but was never implemented jesse hawley had envisioned encouraging the growing of large quantities of grain on the western new york plains then largely unsettled for sale on the eastern seaboard however he went bankrupt trying to ship grain to the coast while in canandaigua debtors prison hawley began pressing for the construction of a canal along the mile km long mohawk river valley with support from joseph ellicott agent for the holland land company in batavia ellicott realized that a canal would add value to the land he was selling in the western part of the state he later became the first canal commissioner new york legislators became interested in the possibility of building a canal across new york in the first decade of the th century shipping goods west from albany was a costly and tedious affair there was no railroad yet and to cover the distance from buffalo to new york city by stagecoach took two weeks the problem was that the land rises about feet m from the hudson to lake erie locks at the time could handle up to feet m of lift so even with the heftiest cuttings and viaducts fifty locks would be required along the mile km canal such a canal would be expensive to build even with modern technology in the expense was barely imaginable president thomas jefferson called it little short of madness and rejected it eventually hawley interested new york governor dewitt clinton in the project there was much opposition and the project was ridiculed as clinton s folly and clinton s ditch self published source in though clinton received approval from the legislature for million for construction the original canal was miles km long from albany on the hudson to buffalo on lake erie the channel was cut feet m wide and feet m deep with removed soil piled on the downhill side to form a walkway known as a towpath its construction through limestone and mountains proved a daunting task to move earth animals pulled a slip scraper similar to a bulldozer the sides of the canal were lined with stone set in clay and the bottom was also lined with clay the canal was built by irish laborers and german stonemasons all labor on the canal depended upon human and animal power or the force of water engineering techniques developed during its construction included the building of aqueducts to redirect water one aqueduct was feet m long to span feet m of river as the canal progressed the crews and engineers working on the project developed expertise and became a skilled labor force the men who planned and oversaw construction were novices as surveyors and as engineers there were no civil engineers in the united states james geddes and benjamin wright who laid out the route were judges whose experience in surveying was in settling boundary disputes geddes had only used a surveying instrument for a few hours before his work on the canal canvass white was a year old amateur engineer who persuaded clinton to let him go to britain at his own expense to study the canal system there nathan roberts was a mathematics teacher and land speculator yet these men carried the erie canal up the niagara escarpment at lockport maneuvered it onto a towering embankment to cross over irondequoit creek spanned the genesee river on an awesome aqueduct and carved a route for it out of the solid rock between little falls and schenectady and all of those venturesome designs worked precisely as planned construction began on july at rome new york the first miles km from rome to utica opened in at that rate the canal would not be finished for years the main delays were caused by felling trees to clear a path through virgin forest and moving excavated soil which took longer than expected but the builders devised ways to solve these problems to fell a tree they threw rope over the top branches and winched it down they pulled out the stumps with an innovative stump puller two huge wheels were mounted loose on the ends of an axle a third wheel slightly smaller than the others was fixed to the center of the axle a chain was wrapped around the axle and hooked to the stump a rope was wrapped around the center wheel and hooked to a team of oxen the mechanical advantage torque obtained ripped the stumps out of the soil soil to be moved was shoveled into large wheelbarrows that were dumped into mule pulled carts using a scraper and a plow a three man team with oxen horses and mules could build a mile in a year the remaining problem was finding labor increased immigration helped fill the need many of the laborers working on the canal were irish who had recently come to the united states as a group of about most of them were roman catholic a religion that raised much suspicion in early america because of its hierarchic structure and many laborers on the canal suffered violent assault as the result of misjudgment and xenophobia construction continued at an increased rate as new workers arrived when the canal reached montezuma marsh at the outlet of cayuga lake west of syracuse it was rumored that over workers died of swamp fever malaria and construction was temporarily stopped however recent research has revealed that the death toll was likely much lower as no contemporary reports mention significant worker mortality and mass graves from the period have never been found in the area work continued on the downhill side towards the hudson and the crews worked on the section across the swampland when it froze in winter the middle section from utica to salina syracuse was completed in and traffic on that section started up immediately expansion to the east and west proceeded simultaneously and the whole eastern section miles km from brockport to albany opened on september to great fanfare the champlain canal a separate but connected mile km north south route from watervliet on the hudson to lake champlain opened on the same date after montezuma marsh the next difficulties were crossing irondequoit creek and the genesee river near rochester the former ultimately required building the foot m long great embankment to carry the canal at a height of feet m above the level of the creek which ran through a foot m culvert underneath the canal crossed the river on a stone aqueduct feet m long and feet m wide supported by arches self published source in construction reached the niagara escarpment an foot m high wall of hard dolomitic limestone the route followed the channel of a creek that had cut a ravine steeply down the escarpment the construction and operation of two sets of five locks along a mile km corridor soon gave rise to the community of lockport the foot m lift locks had a total lift of feet m exiting into a deeply cut channel the final leg had to be cut feet m deep through another limestone mass the onondaga ridge much of that section was blasted with black powder and the inexperience of the crews often led to accidents and sometimes to rocks falling on nearby homes citation needed two villages competed to be the terminus black rock on the niagara river and buffalo at the eastern tip of lake erie buffalo expended great energy to widen and deepen buffalo creek to make it navigable and to create a harbor at its mouth buffalo won over black rock and grew into a large city eventually encompassing its former rival in before the canal was completed a detailed pocket guide for the tourist and traveler along the line of the canals and the interior commerce of the state of new york was published for the benefit of travelers and land speculators the entire canal was officially completed on october the event was marked by a statewide grand celebration culminating in a series of cannon shots along the length of the canal and the hudson a minute cannonade from buffalo to new york city a flotilla of boats led by governor dewitt clinton aboard seneca chief sailed from buffalo to new york city over ten days clinton then ceremonially poured lake erie water into new york harbor to mark the wedding of the waters on its return trip seneca chief brought back a keg of atlantic ocean water which was poured into lake erie by buffalo s judge samuel wilkeson who would later become mayor the erie canal was thus completed in eight years at a cost of million equivalent to million in it was acclaimed as an engineering marvel that united the country and helped new york city develop as an international trade center problems developed but were quickly solved leaks developed along the entire length of the canal but these were sealed using cement that hardened underwater hydraulic cement erosion on the clay bottom proved to be a problem and the speed was limited to mph km h the erie made use of the favorable conditions of new york s unique topography which provided that area with the only break in the appalachians south of the st lawrence river the hudson is tidal to troy and albany is west of the appalachians it allowed for east west navigation from the coast to the great lakes within us territory the canal began on the west side of the hudson river at albany and ran north to watervliet where the champlain canal branched off at cohoes it climbed the escarpment on the west side of the hudson river locks rising feet m and then turned west along the south shore of the mohawk river crossing to the north side at crescent and again to the south at rexford the canal continued west near the south shore of the mohawk river all the way to rome where the mohawk turns north at rome the canal continued west parallel to wood creek which flows westward into oneida lake and turned southwest and west cross country to avoid the lake from canastota west it ran roughly along the north lower edge of the onondaga escarpment passing through syracuse onondaga lake and rochester before reaching rochester the canal uses a series of natural ridges to cross the deep valley of irondequoit creek at lockport the canal turned southwest to rise to the top of the niagara escarpment using the ravine of eighteen mile creek the canal continued south southwest to pendleton where it turned west and southwest mainly using the channel of tonawanda creek from the tonawanda south toward buffalo it ran just east of the niagara river where it reached its western terminus at little buffalo creek later it became the commercial slip which discharged into the buffalo river just above its confluence with lake erie with buffalo s re excavation of the commercial slip completed in the canal s original terminus is now re watered and again accessible by boats with several miles of the canal inland of this location still lying under th century fill and urban construction the effective western navigable terminus of the erie canal is found at tonawanda canal boats up to feet m in draft were pulled by horses and mules walking on the towpath the canal had one towpath generally on the north side when canal boats met the boat with the right of way remained on the towpath side of the canal the other boat steered toward the berm or heelpath side of the canal the driver or hoggee pronounced ho gee of the privileged boat kept his towpath team by the canalside edge of the towpath while the hoggee of the other boat moved to the outside of the towpath and stopped his team his towline would be unhitched from the horses go slack fall into the water and sink to the bottom while his boat coasted with its remaining momentum the privileged boat s team would step over the other boat s towline with its horses pulling the boat over the sunken towline without stopping once clear the other boat s team would continue on its way citation needed pulled by teams of horses canal boats moved slowly but methodically shrinking time and distance efficiently the smooth nonstop method of transportation cut the travel time between albany and buffalo nearly in half moving by day and by night migrants took passage on freight boats camping on deck or on top of crates packet boats serving passengers exclusively reached speeds of up to five miles per hour km h and ran at much more frequent intervals than the cramped bumpy stagecoach wagons these boats measuring up to feet m long and feet m wide made ingenious use of space accommodating up to passengers at night and up to three times as many in the daytime the best examples furnished with carpeted floors stuffed chairs and mahogany tables stocked with books and current newspapers served as sitting rooms during the days at mealtimes crews transformed the cabin into a dining room drawing a curtain across the width of the room divided the cabin into ladies and gentlemen s sleeping quarters at night pull down tiered beds folded from the walls and additional cots could be hung from hooks in the ceiling some captains hired musicians and held dances the new york state legislature debated closing the locks of the erie canal on sundays when they convened in however george jeremiah and dwight bacheller two of the bill s opponents argued that the state had no right to stop canal traffic on the grounds that the erie canal and its tributaries had ceased to be wards of the state the canal at its inception had been imagined as an extension of nature an artificial river where there had been none the canal succeeded by sharing more in common with lakes and seas than it had with public roads jeremiah and bacheller argued successfully that just as it was unthinkable to halt oceangoing navigation on sunday so it was with the canal the erie canal greatly lowered the cost of shipping between the midwest and the northeast bringing much lower food costs to eastern cities and allowing the east to economically ship machinery and manufactured goods to the midwest to give an example the cost to transport barrel of flour from rochester to albany dropped from before the canal to on the canal the canal also made an immense contribution to the wealth and importance of new york city buffalo and new york state its impact went much further increasing trade throughout the nation by opening eastern and overseas markets to midwestern farm products and by enabling migration to the west the port of new york became essentially the atlantic home port for all of the midwest because of this vital connection and others to follow such as the railroads new york would become known as the empire state or the great empire state the erie canal was an immediate success tolls collected on freight had already exceeded the state s construction debt in its first year of official operation by import duties collected at the new york customs house supported federal government operations and provided funds for all the expenses in washington except the interest on the national debt additionally new york state s initial loan for the original canal had been paid by although it had been envisioned as primarily a commercial channel for freight boats passengers also traveled on the canal s packet boats in more than passengers took advantage of the convenience and beauty of canal travel the canal s steady flow of tourists businessmen and settlers lent it to uses never imagined by its initial sponsors evangelical preachers made their circuits of the upstate region and the canal served as the last leg of the underground railroad ferrying runaway slaves to buffalo near the canada us border aspiring merchants found that tourists were reliable customers vendors moved from boat to boat peddling items such as books watches and fruit while less scrupulous confidence men sold remedies for foot corns or passed off counterfeit bills tourists were carried along the northern tour which ultimately led to the popular honeymoon destination niagara falls just north of buffalo as the canal brought travelers to new york city it took business away from other ports such as philadelphia and baltimore those cities and their states started projects to compete with the erie canal in pennsylvania the main line of public works was a combined canal and railroad running west from philadelphia to pittsburgh on the ohio river opened in in maryland the baltimore and ohio railroad ran west to wheeling west virginia then a part of virginia also on the ohio river and was completed in the canal played a major role in the growth of standard oil as founder john d rockefeller used the canal as a cheaper form of transportation in the summer months when it was not frozen to get his refined oil from cleveland to new york city in the winter months his only options were the three trunk lines the erie railroad the new york central railroad or the pennsylvania railroad new ethnic irish communities formed in some towns along its route after completion as irish immigrants were a large portion of the construction labor force a plaque honoring the canal s construction is located in battery park in southern manhattan because so many immigrants traveled on the canal many genealogists have sought copies of canal passenger lists apart from the years canal boat operators were not required to record passenger names or report them to the new york government some passenger lists survive today in the new york state archives and other sources of traveler information are sometimes available the canal allowed buffalo to grow from just settlers in to more than people by the canal also helped bind the still new nation closer to britain and europe repeal of britain s corn law resulted in a huge increase in exports of midwestern wheat to britain trade between the united states and canada also increased as a result of the repeal and a reciprocity free trade agreement signed in much of this trade flowed along the erie its success also prompted imitation a rash of canal building followed also the many technical hurdles that had to be overcome made heroes of those whose innovations made the canal possible this led to an increased public esteem for practical education chicago among other great lakes cities recognized the importance of the canal to its economy and two west loop streets are named canal and clinton for canal proponent dewitt clinton concern that erosion caused by logging in the adirondacks could silt up the canal contributed to the creation in of another new york national historic landmark the adirondack park many notable authors wrote about the canal including herman melville frances trollope nathaniel hawthorne harriet beecher stowe mark twain samuel hopkins adams and the marquis de lafayette and many tales and songs were written about life on the canal the popular song low bridge everybody down by thomas s allen was written in to memorialize the canal s early heyday when barges were pulled by mules rather than engines consisting of a massive stone aqueduct that carried boats over incredible cascades little falls was one of the most popular stops for american and foreign tourists this is shown in scene of william dunlap s play a trip to niagara where he depicts the general preference of tourists to travel by canal so that they could experience a combination of artificial and natural sights canal travel was for many an opportunity to take in the sublime and commune with nature the play also reflects the less enthusiastic view of some who saw movement on the canal as tedious the erie canal changed property law in new york most importantly it expanded the government s right to take private property cases surrounding the newly built erie canal expanded condemnation theory to permit canal builders to appropriate private land and broadened the meaning of public use in the th amendment to the u s constitution the canal also had an impact on water access jurisprudence as well as nuisance law additional feeder canals soon extended the erie canal into a system these included the cayuga seneca canal south to the finger lakes the oswego canal from three rivers north to lake ontario at oswego and the champlain canal from troy north to lake champlain from to the short crooked lake canal connected keuka lake and seneca lake the chemung canal connected the south end of seneca lake to elmira in and was an important route for pennsylvania coal and timber into the canal system the chenango canal in connected the erie canal at utica to binghamton and caused a business boom in the chenango river valley the chenango and chemung canals linked the erie with the susquehanna river system the black river canal connected the black river to the erie canal at rome and remained in operation until the s the genesee valley canal was run along the genesee river to connect with the allegheny river at olean but the allegheny section which would have connected to the ohio and mississippi rivers was never built the genesee valley canal was later abandoned and became the route of the genesee valley canal railroad the original design planned for an annual tonnage of million tons million metric tons but this was exceeded immediately an ambitious program to improve the canal began in during this massive series of construction projects known as the first enlargement the canal was widened from to feet to m and deepened from to feet to m locks were widened and or rebuilt in new locations and many new navigable aqueducts were constructed the canal was straightened and slightly re routed in some stretches resulting in the abandonment of short segments of the original canal the first enlargement was completed in with further minor enlargements in later decades the mohawk and hudson railroad opened in providing a bypass to the slowest part of the canal between albany and schenectady other railroads were soon chartered and built to continue the line west to buffalo and in a continuous line which later became the new york central railroad and its auburn road in was open the whole way to buffalo as the railroad served the same general route as the canal but provided for faster travel passengers soon switched to it however as late as the canal carried thirteen times more freight tonnage than all the railroads in new york state combined the new york west shore and buffalo railway was completed in as a route running closely parallel to both the canal and the new york central railroad however it went bankrupt and was acquired the next year by the new york central the canal continued to compete well with the railroads through when tolls were abolished in the new york state legislature authorized construction of the new york state barge canal as the improvement of the erie the oswego the champlain and the cayuga and seneca canals in construction of the barge canal began which was completed in at a cost of million this new canal replaced much of the original route leaving many abandoned sections most notably between syracuse and rome new digging and flood control technologies allowed engineers to canalize rivers that the original canal had sought to avoid such as the mohawk seneca and clyde rivers and oneida lake in sections that did not consist of canalized rivers particularly between rochester and buffalo the original erie canal channel was enlarged to feet m wide and feet m deep the expansion allowed barges up to short tons t to use the canal this expensive project was politically unpopular in parts of the state not served by the canal and failed to save it from becoming obsolete for commercial shipping the new alignment began on the hudson river at the border between cohoes and waterford where it ran northwest with five locks the so called waterford flight running into the mohawk river east of crescent the waterford flight is claimed to be one of the steepest series of locks in the world while the old canal ran next to the mohawk all the way to rome the new canal ran through the river which was straightened or widened where necessary at ilion the new canal left the river for good but continued to run on a new alignment parallel to both the river and the old canal to rome from rome the new route continued almost due west merging with fish creek just east of its entry into oneida lake from oneida lake the new canal ran west along the oneida river with cutoffs to shorten the route at three rivers the oneida river turns northwest and was deepened for the oswego canal to lake ontario the new erie canal turned south there along the seneca river which turns west near syracuse and continues west to a point in the montezuma marsh there the cayuga and seneca canal continued south with the seneca river and the new erie canal again ran parallel to the old canal along the bottom of the niagara escarpment in some places running along the clyde river and in some places replacing the old canal at pittsford southeast of rochester the canal turned west to run around the south side of rochester rather than through downtown the canal crosses the genesee river at the genesee valley park then rejoins the old path near north gates from there it was again roughly an upgrade to the original canal running west to lockport this reach of miles km from henrietta to lockport is called the mile level since there are no locks and the water level rises only two feet m over the entire segment diversions from and to adjacent natural streams along the way are used to maintain the canal s level it runs southwest to tonawanda where the new alignment discharges into the niagara river which is navigable upstream to the new york barge canal s black rock lock and thence to the canal s original western terminus at buffalo s inner harbor freight traffic reached a total of million short tons million metric tons by the growth of railroads and highways across the state and the opening of the st lawrence seaway in caused commercial traffic on the canal to decline dramatically during the second half of the th century citation needed since the s the canal system has been used primarily by recreational traffic although a small but growing amount of cargo traffic still uses it in the new york state barge canal was renamed the new york state canal system including the erie cayuga seneca oswego and champlain canals and placed under the newly created new york state canal corporation a subsidiary of the new york state thruway authority while part of the thruway the canal system was operated using money generated by thruway tolls in the new york state canal corporation was transferred from the new york state thruway to the new york power authority in congress designated the erie canalway national heritage corridor covering miles km of navigable water from lake champlain to the capital region and west to buffalo the area has a population of million about of central and western new york s population lives within miles km of the erie canal there were some commercial shipments on the canal in compared to such shipments in and more than shipments in the canal s peak year the new growth in commercial traffic is due to the rising cost of diesel fuel canal barges can carry a short ton of cargo miles km on one gallon of diesel fuel while a gallon allows a train to haul the same amount of cargo miles km and a truck miles km canal barges can carry loads up to short tons long tons and are used to transport objects that would be too large for road or rail shipment today the system is served by several commercial towing companies in the new york state canal system which consists of the erie canal and a few smaller canals was used to ship tons of cargo travel on the canal s middle section particularly in the mohawk valley was severely hampered by flooding in late june and early july flood damage to the canal and its facilities was estimated as at least million citation needed aside from transportation numerous businesses farms factories and communities alongside its banks still utilize the canal s waters for other purposes such as irrigation for farmland hydroelectricity research industry and even drinking use of the canal system has an estimated total economic impact of billion annually the erie canal is open to small craft and some larger vessels from may through november each year during winter water is drained from parts of the canal for maintenance the champlain canal lake champlain and the chambly canal and richelieu river in canada form the lakes to locks passage making a tourist attraction of the former waterway linking eastern canada to the erie canal in recreational boating fees were eliminated to attract more visitors citation needed the erie canal is a destination for tourists from all over the world and has inspired guidebooks dedicated to exploration of the waterway an erie canal cruise company based in herkimer operates from mid may until mid october with daily cruises the cruise goes through the history of the canal and also takes passengers through lock today the reconfiguration of the canal created during the first enlargement is commonly referred to as the improved erie canal or the old erie canal to distinguish it from the canal s modern day course existing remains of the canal abandoned during the enlargement are officially referred to today as clinton s ditch which was also the popular nickname for the entire erie canal project during its original construction sections of the old erie canal not used after are owned by new york state or have been ceded to or purchased by counties or municipalities many stretches of the old canal have been filled in to create roads such as erie boulevard in syracuse and schenectady and broad street and the rochester subway in rochester a mile km stretch of the old canal from the town of dewitt new york east of syracuse to just outside rome new york is preserved as the old erie canal state historic park in the schoharie crossing state historic site a section of the canal in montgomery county was one of the first sites recognized as a national historic landmark some municipalities have preserved sections as town or county canal parks or have plans to do so camillus erie canal park preserves a mile km stretch and has restored nine mile creek aqueduct built in as part of the first enlargement of the canal in some communities the old canal has refilled with overgrowth and debris proposals have been made to rehydrate the old canal through downtown rochester or syracuse as a tourist attraction in syracuse the location of the old canal is represented by a reflecting pool in downtown s clinton square and the downtown hosts a canal barge and weigh lock structure now dry buffalo s commercial slip is the restored and re watered segment of the canal which formed its western terminus in the administration of new york governor george pataki was criticized when officials of new york state canal corporation attempted to sell private development rights to large stretches of the old erie canal to a single developer for far less than the land was worth on the open market after an investigation by the syracuse post standard newspaper the pataki administration nullified the deal parks and museums related to the old erie canal include listed from east to west records of the planning design construction and administration of the erie canal are vast and can be found in the new york state archives except for two years the state of new york did not require canal boat operators to maintain or submit passenger lists the following list of locks is provided for the current canal from east to west there are a total of numbered locks on the erie canal all locks on the new york state canal system are single chamber the dimensions are feet m long and feet m wide with a minimum foot m depth of water over the miter sills at the upstream gates upon lift they can accommodate a vessel up to feet m long and feet m wide self published source overall sidewall height will vary by lock ranging between and feet and m depending on the lift and navigable stages lock e at little falls has the tallest sidewall height at feet m distance is based on position markers from an interactive canal map provided online by the new york state canal corporation and may not exactly match specifications on signs posted along the canal mean surface elevations are comprised from a combination of older canal profiles and history books as well as specifications on signs posted along the canal the margin of error should normally be within inches cm the waterford flight series of locks comprising locks e through e is one of the steepest in the world lifting boats feet m in less than miles km all surface elevations are approximate upstream west downstream east upstream west denotes federally managed locks there is a foot m natural rise between locks e and e as well as a foot m natural rise between lock e and the niagara river there is no lock e or lock e on the erie canal the place of lock e on the passage from the lower hudson river to lake erie is taken by the troy federal lock located just north of troy new york and is not part of the erie canal system proper it is operated by the united states army corps of engineers the erie canal officially begins at the confluence of the hudson and mohawk rivers at waterford new york although the original alignment of the erie canal through buffalo has been filled in travel by water is still possible from buffalo via the black rock lock in the niagara river to the canal s modern western terminus in tonawanda and eastward to albany the black rock lock is operated by the united states army corps of engineers oneida lake lies between locks e and e and has a mean surface elevation of feet m lake erie has a mean surface elevation of feet m

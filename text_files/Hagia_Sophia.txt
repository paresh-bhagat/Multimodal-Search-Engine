 hagia sophia lit holy wisdom ancient greek romanized hag a soph a latin sancta sapientia turkish ayasofya officially the hagia sophia grand mosque turkish ayasofya i kebir cami i erifi is a mosque and major cultural and historical site in istanbul turkey the cathedral was a greek orthodox church from ad until the conquest of constantinople by the ottoman empire in it served as a mosque until when it became a museum in the site once again became a mosque originally built by the eastern roman emperor justinian i as the christian cathedral of constantinople for the state church of the roman empire between and and designed by the greek geometers isidore of miletus and anthemius of tralles it was formally called the church of the holy wisdom greek romanized na s t s hag as to theo soph as and was then the world s largest interior space and among the first to employ a fully pendentive dome it is considered the epitome of byzantine architecture and is said to have changed the history of architecture the present justinianic building was the third church of the same name to occupy the site as the prior one had been destroyed in the nika riots as the episcopal see of the ecumenical patriarch of constantinople it remained the world s largest cathedral for nearly a thousand years until seville cathedral was completed in beginning with subsequent byzantine architecture hagia sophia became the paradigmatic orthodox church form and its architectural style was emulated by ottoman mosques a thousand years later it has been described as holding a unique position in the christian world and as an architectural and cultural icon of byzantine and eastern orthodox civilization the religious and spiritual centre of the eastern orthodox church for nearly one thousand years the church was dedicated to the holy wisdom it was where the excommunication of patriarch michael i cerularius was officially delivered by humbert of silva candida the envoy of pope leo ix in an act considered the start of the east west schism in it was converted during the fourth crusade into a catholic cathedral under the latin empire before being returned to the eastern orthodox church upon the restoration of the byzantine empire in the doge of venice who led the fourth crusade and the sack of constantinople enrico dandolo was buried in the church after the fall of constantinople to the ottoman empire in it was converted to a mosque by mehmed the conqueror and became the principal mosque of istanbul until the construction of the sultan ahmed mosque upon its conversion the bells altar iconostasis ambo and baptistery were removed while iconography such as the mosaic depictions of jesus mary christian saints and angels were removed or plastered over islamic architectural additions included four minarets a minbar and a mihrab the byzantine architecture of the hagia sophia served as inspiration for many other religious buildings including the hagia sophia in thessaloniki panagia ekatontapiliani the ehzade mosque the s leymaniye mosque the r stem pasha mosque and the k l ali pasha complex the patriarchate moved to the church of the holy apostles which became the city s cathedral the complex remained a mosque until when it was closed to the public for four years it was re opened in as a museum under the secular republic of turkey and the building is turkey s most visited tourist attraction as of update in july the council of state annulled the decision to establish the museum and the hagia sophia was reclassified as a mosque the decree was ruled to be unlawful under both ottoman and turkish law as hagia sophia s waqf endowed by sultan mehmed had designated the site a mosque proponents of the decision argued the hagia sophia was the personal property of the sultan this redesignation drew condemnation from the turkish opposition unesco the world council of churches the international association of byzantine studies and many international leaders the first church on the site was known as the magna ecclesia meg l ekkl s great church because of its size compared to the sizes of the contemporary churches in the city according to the chronicon paschale the church was consecrated on february during the reign of the emperor constantius ii r by the arian bishop eudoxius of antioch it was built next to the area where the great palace was being developed according to the th century ecclesiastical historian socrates of constantinople the emperor constantius had c constructed the great church alongside that called irene which because it was too small the emperor s father constantine had enlarged and beautified a tradition which is not older than the th or th century reports that the edifice was built by constantius father constantine the great r hesychius of miletus wrote that constantine built hagia sophia with a wooden roof and removed mostly pagan statues from the site the th century chronicler joannes zonaras reconciles the two opinions writing that constantius had repaired the edifice consecrated by eusebius of nicomedia after it had collapsed since eusebius was the bishop of constantinople from to and constantine died in it seems that the first church was erected by constantius the nearby hagia irene holy peace church was completed earlier and served as cathedral until the great church was completed besides hagia irene there is no record of major churches in the city centre before the late th century rowland mainstone argued the th century church was not yet known as hagia sophia though its name as the great church implies that it was larger than other constantinopolitan churches the only other major churches of the th century were the church of st mocius which lay outside the constantinian walls and was perhaps attached to a cemetery and the church of the holy apostles the church itself is known to have had a timber roof curtains columns and an entrance that faced west it likely had a narthex and is described as being shaped like a roman circus this may mean that it had a u shaped plan like the basilicas of san marcellino e pietro and sant agnese fuori le mura in rome however it may also have been a more conventional three four or five aisled basilica perhaps resembling the original church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem or the church of the nativity in bethlehem the building was likely preceded by an atrium as in the later churches on the site citation needed according to ken dark and jan kostenec a further remnant of the th century basilica may exist in a wall of alternating brick and stone banded masonry immediately to the west of the justinianic church the top part of the wall is constructed with bricks stamped with brick stamps dating from the th century but the lower part is of constructed with bricks typical of the th century this wall was probably part of the propylaeum at the west front of both the constantinian and theodosian great churches the building was accompanied by a baptistery and a skeuophylakion a hypogeum perhaps with an martyrium above it was discovered before and the remnants of a brick wall with traces of marble revetment were identified in the hypogeum was a tomb which may have been part of the th century church or may have been from the pre constantinian city of byzantium the skeuophylakion is said by palladius to have had a circular floor plan and since some u shaped basilicas in rome were funerary churches with attached circular mausolea the mausoleum of constantina and the mausoleum of helena it is possible it originally had a funerary function though by its use had changed a later account credited a woman called anna with donating the land on which the church was built in return for the right to be buried there excavations on the western side of the site of the first church under the propylaeum wall reveal that the first church was built atop a road about metres ft wide according to early accounts the first hagia sophia was built on the site of an ancient pagan temple although there are no artefacts to confirm this the patriarch of constantinople john chrysostom came into a conflict with empress aelia eudoxia wife of the emperor arcadius r and was sent into exile on june during the subsequent riots this first church was largely burnt down palladius noted that the th century skeuophylakion survived the fire according to dark and kostenec the fire may only have affected the main basilica leaving the surrounding ancillary buildings intact a second church on the site was ordered by theodosius ii r who inaugurated it on october the notitia urbis constantinopolitanae a fifth century list of monuments names hagia sophia as magna ecclesia great church while the former cathedral hagia irene is referred to as ecclesia antiqua old church at the time of socrates of constantinople around both churches were enclosed by a single wall and served by the same clergy thus the complex would have encompassed a large area including the future site of the hospital of samson if the fire of destroyed only the th century main basilica church then the th century theodosian basilica could have been built surrounded by a complex constructed primarily during the fourth century during the reign of theodosius ii the emperor s elder sister the augusta pulcheria r was challenged by the patriarch nestorius r april june the patriarch denied the augusta access to the sanctuary of the great church likely on april according to the anonymous letter to cosmas the virgin empress a promoter of the cult of the virgin mary who habitually partook in the eucharist at the sanctuary of nestorius s predecessors claimed right of entry because of her equivalent position to the theotokos the virgin mary having given birth to god their theological differences were part of the controversy over the title theotokos that resulted in the council of ephesus and the stimulation of monophysitism and nestorianism a doctrine which like nestorius rejects the use of the title pulcheria along with pope celestine i and patriarch cyril of alexandria had nestorius overthrown condemned at the ecumenical council and exiled the area of the western entrance to the justinianic hagia sophia revealed the western remains of its theodosian predecessor as well as some fragments of the constantinian church german archaeologist alfons maria schneider began conducting archaeological excavations during the mid s publishing his final report in excavations in the area that had once been the th century atrium of the justinianic church revealed the monumental western entrance and atrium along with columns and sculptural fragments from both th and th century churches further digging was abandoned for fear of harming the structural integrity of the justinianic building but parts of the excavation trenches remain uncovered laying bare the foundations of the theodosian building the basilica was built by architect rufinus the church s main entrance which may have had gilded doors faced west and there was an additional entrance to the east there was a central pulpit and likely an upper gallery possibly employed as a matroneum women s section the exterior was decorated with elaborate carvings of rich theodosian era designs fragments of which have survived while the floor just inside the portico was embellished with polychrome mosaics the surviving carved gable end from the centre of the western fa ade is decorated with a cross roundel fragments of a frieze of reliefs with lambs representing the apostles also remain unlike justinian s th century church the theodosian hagia sophia had both colourful floor mosaics and external decorative sculpture at the western end surviving stone fragments of the structure show there was vaulting at least at the western end the theodosian building had a monumental propylaeum hall with a portico that may account for this vaulting which was thought by the original excavators in the s to be part of the western entrance of the church itself the propylaeum opened onto an atrium which lay in front of the basilica church itself preceding the propylaeum was a steep monumental staircase following the contours of the ground as it sloped away westwards in the direction of the strategion the basilica and the harbours of the golden horn this arrangement would have resembled the steps outside the atrium of the constantinian old st peter s basilica in rome near the staircase there was a cistern perhaps to supply a fountain in the atrium or for worshippers to wash with before entering the th century skeuophylakion was replaced in the th century by the present day structure a rotunda constructed of banded masonry in the lower two levels and of plain brick masonry in the third originally this rotunda probably employed as a treasury for liturgical objects had a second floor internal gallery accessed by an external spiral staircase and two levels of niches for storage a further row of windows with marble window frames on the third level remain bricked up the gallery was supported on monumental consoles with carved acanthus designs similar to those used on the late th century column of leo a large lintel of the skeuophylakion s western entrance bricked up during the ottoman era was discovered inside the rotunda when it was archaeologically cleared to its foundations in during which time the brickwork was also repointed the skeuophylakion was again restored in by the vak flar a fire started during the tumult of the nika revolt which had begun nearby in the hippodrome of constantinople and the second hagia sophia was burnt to the ground on january the court historian procopius wrote and by way of shewing that it was not against the emperor alone that they the rioters had taken up arms but no less against god himself unholy wretches that they were they had the hardihood to fire the church of the christians which the people of byzantium call sophia an epithet which they have most appropriately invented for god by which they call his temple and god permitted them to accomplish this impiety foreseeing into what an object of beauty this shrine was destined to be transformed so the whole church at that time lay a charred mass of ruins column and capital with a greek cross porphyry column column capital impost block soffits and cornice columns and other fragments frieze with lambs theodosian capital theodosian capital for a pilaster one of the few remains of the church of theodosius ii soffits on february only a few weeks after the destruction of the second basilica emperor justinian i inaugurated the construction of a third and entirely different basilica larger and more majestic than its predecessors justinian appointed two architects mathematician anthemius of tralles and geometer and engineer isidore of miletus to design the building construction of the church began in during the short tenure of phocas as praetorian prefect although phocas had been arrested in as a suspected practitioner of paganism he replaced john the cappadocian after the nika riots saw the destruction of the theodosian church according to john the lydian phocas was responsible for funding the initial construction of the building with roman pounds of gold but he was dismissed from office in october john the lydian wrote that phocas had acquired the funds by moral means but evagrius scholasticus later wrote that the money had been obtained unjustly according to anthony kaldellis both of hagia sophia s architects named by procopius were associated with to the school of the pagan philosopher ammonius of alexandria it is possible that both they and john the lydian considered hagia sophia a great temple for the supreme neoplatonist deity who manifestated through light and the sun john the lydian describes the church as the temenos of the great god greek romanized t to meg lou theo t menos originally the exterior of the church was covered with marble veneer as indicated by remaining pieces of marble and surviving attachments for lost panels on the building s western face the white marble cladding of much of the church together with gilding of some parts would have given hagia sophia a shimmering appearance quite different from the brick and plaster work of the modern period and would have significantly increased its visibility from the sea the cathedral s interior surfaces were sheathed with polychrome marbles green and white with purple porphyry and gold mosaics the exterior was clad in stucco that was tinted yellow and red during the th century restorations by the fossati architects the construction is described by procopius in on buildings greek romanized peri ktismat n latin de aedificiis columns and other marble elements were imported from throughout the mediterranean although the columns were once thought to be spoils from cities such as rome and ephesus even though they were made specifically for hagia sophia they vary in size more than ten thousand people were employed during the construction process this new church was contemporaneously recognized as a major work of architecture outside the church was an elaborate array of monuments around the bronze plated column of justinian topped by an equestrian statue of the emperor which dominated the augustaeum the open square outside the church which connected it with the great palace complex through the chalke gate at the edge of the augustaeum was the milion and the regia the first stretch of constantinople s main thoroughfare the mese also facing the augustaeum were the enormous constantinian thermae the baths of zeuxippus and the justinianic civic basilica under which was the vast cistern known as the basilica cistern on the opposite side of hagia sophia was the former cathedral hagia irene referring to the destruction of the theodosian hagia sophia and comparing the new church with the old procopius lauded the justinianic building writing in de aedificiis the emperor justinian built not long afterwards a church so finely shaped that if anyone had enquired of the christians before the burning if it would be their wish that the church should be destroyed and one like this should take its place shewing them some sort of model of the building we now see it seems to me that they would have prayed that they might see their church destroyed forthwith in order that the building might be converted into its present form upon seeing the finished building the emperor reportedly said salomon i have surpassed thee medieval greek justinian and patriarch menas inaugurated the new basilica on december years and months after construction started with much pomp hagia sophia was the seat of the patriarchate of constantinople and a principal setting for byzantine imperial ceremonies such as coronations the basilica offered sanctuary from persecution to criminals although there was disagreement about whether justinian had intended for murderers to be eligible for asylum earthquakes in august and on december caused cracks in the main dome and eastern semi dome according to the chronicle of john malalas during a subsequent earthquake on may the eastern semi dome collapsed destroying the ambon altar and ciborium the collapse was due mainly to the excessive bearing load and to the enormous shear load of the dome which was too flat these caused the deformation of the piers which sustained the dome justinian ordered an immediate restoration he entrusted it to isidorus the younger nephew of isidore of miletus who used lighter materials the entire vault had to be taken down and rebuilt byzantine feet meters or feet higher than before giving the building its current interior height of meters ft moreover isidorus changed the dome type erecting a ribbed dome with pendentives whose diameter was between and m under justinian s orders eight corinthian columns were disassembled from baalbek lebanon and shipped to constantinople around this reconstruction which gave the church its present th century form was completed in the poet paul the silentiary composed an ekphrasis or long visual poem for the re dedication of the basilica presided over by patriarch eutychius on december paul the silentiary s poem is conventionally known under the latin title descriptio sanctae sophiae and he was also author of another ekphrasis on the ambon of the church the descripto ambonis according to the history of the patriarch nicephorus i and the chronicler theophanes the confessor various liturgical vessels of the cathedral were melted down on the order of the emperor heraclius r after the capture of alexandria and roman egypt by the sasanian empire during the byzantine sasanian war of theophanes states that these were made into gold and silver coins and a tribute was paid to the avars the avars attacked the extramural areas of constantinople in causing the byzantines to move the garment relic greek translit esth s of mary mother of jesus to hagia sophia from its usual shrine of the church of the theotokos at blachernae just outside the theodosian walls on may the scholae palatinae an elite body of soldiers protested in hagia sophia against a planned increase in bread prices after a stoppage of the cura annonae rations resulting from the loss of the grain supply from egypt the persians under shahrbaraz and the avars together laid the siege of constantinople in according to the chronicon paschale on august theodore syncellus a deacon and presbyter of hagia sophia was among those who negotiated unsuccessfully with the khagan of the avars a homily attributed by existing manuscripts to theodore syncellus and possibly delivered on the anniversary of the event describes the translation of the virgin s garment and its ceremonial re translation to blachernae by the patriarch sergius i after the threat had passed another eyewitness account of the avar persian siege was written by george of pisidia a deacon of hagia sophia and an administrative official in for the patriarchate from antioch in pisidia both george and theodore likely members of sergius s literary circle attribute the defeat of the avars to the intervention of the theotokos a belief that strengthened in following centuries in the emperor leo the isaurian issued a series of edicts against the veneration of images ordering the army to destroy all icons ushering in the period of byzantine iconoclasm at that time all religious pictures and statues were removed from the hagia sophia following a brief hiatus during the reign of empress irene the iconoclasts returned emperor theophilus r had two winged bronze doors with his monograms installed at the southern entrance of the church the basilica suffered damage first in a great fire in and again in an earthquake on january that caused the collapse of one of the half domes emperor basil i ordered repair of the tympanas arches and vaults in his book de caerimoniis aulae byzantinae book of ceremonies the emperor constantine vii r wrote a detailed account of the ceremonies held in the hagia sophia by the emperor and the patriarch in the s or s probably around or after the rus byzantine war of and the death of the grand prince of kiev igor i r his widow olga of kiev regent for her infant son sviatoslav i r visited the emperor constantine vii and was received as queen of the rus in constantinople she was probably baptized in hagia sophia s baptistery taking the name of the reigning augusta helena lecapena and receiving the titles z st patrik a and the styles of archontissa and hegemon of the rus her baptism was an important step towards the christianization of the kievan rus though the emperor s treatment of her visit in de caerimoniis does not mention baptism olga is deemed a saint and equal to the apostles greek translit isap stolos in the eastern orthodox church according to an early th century source the second church in kiev saint sophia s was founded in anno mundi in the byzantine calendar or c the name of this future cathedral of kiev probably commemorates olga s baptism at hagia sophia after the great earthquake of october which collapsed the western dome arch emperor basil ii asked for the armenian architect trdat creator of the cathedral of ani to direct the repairs he erected again and reinforced the fallen dome arch and rebuilt the west side of the dome with dome ribs the extent of the damage required six years of repair and reconstruction the church was re opened on may at the end of the reconstruction the church s decorations were renovated including the addition of four immense paintings of cherubs a new depiction of christ on the dome a burial cloth of christ shown on fridays and on the apse a new depiction of the virgin mary holding jesus between the apostles peter and paul on the great side arches were painted the prophets and the teachers of the church according to the th century greek historian niketas choniates the emperor john ii comnenus celebrated a revived roman triumph after his victory over the danishmendids at the siege of kastamon in after proceeding through the streets on foot carrying a cross with a silver quadriga bearing the icon of the virgin mary the emperor participated in a ceremony at the cathedral before entering the imperial palace in another triumph was held by the emperor manuel i comnenus again preceding with a gilded silver quadriga bearing the icon of the virgin from the now demolished east gate or gate of st barbara later the turkish top kap s lit cannon gate in the propontis wall to hagia sophia for a thanks giving service and then to the imperial palace in the daughter of the emperor manuel i maria comnena and her husband the caesar renier of montferrat fled to hagia sophia at the culmination of their dispute with the empress maria of antioch regent for her son the emperor alexius ii comnenus maria comnena and renier occupied the cathedral with the support of the patriarch refusing the imperial administration s demands for a peaceful departure according to niketas choniates they transformed the sacred courtyard into a military camp garrisoned the entrances to the complex with locals and mercenaries and despite the strong opposition of the patriarch made the house of prayer into a den of thieves or a well fortified and precipitous stronghold impregnable to assault while all the dwellings adjacent to hagia sophia and adjoining the augusteion were demolished by maria s men a battle ensued in the augustaion and around the milion during which the defenders fought from the gallery of the catechumeneia also called the makron facing the augusteion from which they eventually retreated and took up positions in the exonarthex of hagia sophia itself at this point the patriarch was anxious lest the enemy troops enter the temple with unholy feet trample the holy floor and with hands defiled and dripping with blood still warm plunder the all holy dedicatory offerings after a successful sally by renier and his knights maria requested a truce the imperial assault ceased and an amnesty was negotiated by the megas doux andronikos kontostephanos and the megas hetaireiarches john doukas greek historian niketas choniates compared the preservation of the cathedral to the efforts made by the st century emperor titus to avoid the destruction of the second temple during the siege of jerusalem in the first jewish roman war choniates reports that in a white hawk wearing jesses was seen to fly from the east to hagia sophia flying three times from the building of the th mait s a basilica erected on the southeastern side of the augustaion to the palace of the kathisma in the great palace where new emperors were acclaimed this was supposed to presage the end of the reign of andronicus i comnenus r choniates further writes that in during the fourth crusade the emperors isaac ii angelus and alexius iv angelus stripped hagia sophia of all gold ornaments and silver oil lamps in order to pay off the crusaders who had ousted alexius iii angelus and helped isaac return to the throne upon the subsequent sack of constantinople in the church was further ransacked and desecrated by the crusaders as described by choniates though he did not witness the events in person according to his account composed at the court of the rump empire of nicaea hagia sophia was stripped of its remaining metal ornaments its altar was smashed into pieces and a woman laden with sins sang and danced on the synthronon he adds that mules and donkeys were brought into the cathedral s sanctuary to carry away the gilded silver plating of the bema the ambo and the doors and other furnishings and that one of them slipped on the marble floor and was accidentally disembowelled further contaminating the place according to ali ibn al athir whose treatment of the sack of constantinople was probably dependent on a christian source the crusaders massacred some clerics who had surrendered to them much of the interior was damaged and would not be repaired until its return to orthodox control in the sack of hagia sophia and constantinople in general remained a sore point in catholic eastern orthodox relations during the latin occupation of constantinople the church became a latin catholic cathedral baldwin i of constantinople r was crowned emperor on may in hagia sophia in a ceremony which closely followed byzantine practices enrico dandolo the doge of venice who commanded the sack and invasion of the city by the latin crusaders in is buried inside the church probably in the upper eastern gallery in the th century an italian restoration team placed a cenotaph marker frequently mistaken as being a medieval artifact near the probable location and is still visible today the original tomb was destroyed by the ottomans during the conversion of the church into a mosque upon the capture of constantinople in by the empire of nicaea and the emperor michael viii palaeologus r the church was in a dilapidated state in emperor andronicus ii palaeologus r ordered four new buttresses medieval greek romanized pyram das to be built in the eastern and northern parts of the church financing them with the inheritance of his late wife irene of montferrat d new cracks developed in the dome after the earthquake of october and several parts of the building collapsed on may repairs by architects astras and peralta began in on december isidore of kiev proclaimed in hagia sophia the long anticipated ecclesiastical union between the western catholic and eastern orthodox churches as decided at the council of florence and decreed by the papal bull laetentur caeli though it would be short lived the union was unpopular among the byzantines who had already expelled the patriarch of constantinople gregory iii for his pro union stance a new patriarch was not installed until after the ottoman conquest according to the greek historian doukas the hagia sophia was tainted by these catholic associations and the anti union orthodox faithful avoided the cathedral considering it to be a haunt of demons and a hellenic temple of roman paganism doukas also notes that after the laetentur caeli was proclaimed the byzantines dispersed discontentedly to nearby venues where they drank toasts to the hodegetria icon which had according to late byzantine tradition interceded to save them in the former sieges of constantinople by the avar khaganate and the umayyad caliphate according to nestor iskander s tale on the taking of tsargrad the hagia sophia was the focus of an alarming omen interpreted as the holy spirit abandoning constantinople on may in the final days of the siege of constantinople the sky lit up illuminating the city and many people gathered and saw on the church of the wisdom at the top of the window a large flame of fire issuing forth it encircled the entire neck of the church for a long time the flame gathered into one its flame altered and there was an indescribable light at once it took to the sky the light itself has gone up to heaven the gates of heaven were opened the light was received and again they were closed this phenomenon was perhaps st elmo s fire induced by gunpowder smoke and unusual weather the author relates that the fall of the city to mohammadenism was foretold in an omen seen by constantine the great an eagle fighting with a snake which also signified that in the end christianity will overpower mohammedanism will receive the seven hills and will be enthroned in it the eventual fall of constantinople had long been predicted in apocalyptic literature a reference to the destruction of a city founded on seven hills in the book of revelation was frequently understood to be about constantinople and the apocalypse of pseudo methodius had predicted an ishmaelite conquest of the roman empire in this text the muslim armies reach the forum bovis before being turned back by divine intervention in later apocalyptic texts the climactic turn takes place at the column of theodosius closer to hagia sophia in others it occurs at the column of constantine which is closer still hagia sophia is mentioned in a hagiography of uncertain date detailing the life of the fictional saint andrew the fool the text is self attributed to nicephorus a priest of hagia sophia and contains a description of the end time in the form of a dialogue in which the interlocutor upon being told by the saint that constantinople will be sunk in a flood and that the waters as they gush forth will irresistibly deluge her and cover her and surrender her to the terrifying and immense sea of the abyss says some people say that the great church of god will not be submerged with the city but will be suspended in the air by an invisible power the reply is given that when the whole city sinks into the sea how can the great church remain who will need her do you think god dwells in temples made with hands the column of constantine however is prophesied to endure from the time of procopius in the reign of justinian the equestrian imperial statue on the column of justinian in the augustaion beside hagia sophia which gestured towards asia with right hand was understood to represent the emperor holding back the threat to the romans from the sasanian empire in the roman persian wars while the orb or globus cruciger held in the statue s left was an expression of the global power of the roman emperor subsequently in the arab byzantine wars the threat held back by the statue became the umayyad caliphate and later the statue was thought to be fending off the advance of the turks the identity of the emperor was often confused with that of other famous saint emperors like theodosius the great and heraclius the orb was frequently referred to as an apple in foreigners accounts of the city and it was interpreted in greek folklore as a symbol of the turks mythological homeland in central asia the lone apple tree the orb fell to the ground in and was replaced by but while it was still in place around by the time johann schiltberger saw the statue in the empire apple german reichsapfel had fallen to the earth an attempt to raise it again in failed and this amplified the prophecies of the city s fall for the turks the red apple turkish k z l elma came to symbolize constantinople itself and subsequently the military supremacy of the islamic caliphate over the christian empire in niccol barbaro s account of the fall of the city in the justinianic monument was interpreted in the last days of the siege as representing the city s founder constantine the great indicating this is the way my conqueror will come according to laonicus chalcocondyles hagia sophia was a refuge for the population during the city s capture despite the ill repute and empty state of hagia sophia after december doukas writes that after the theodosian walls were breached the byzantines took refuge there as the turks advanced through the city all the women and men monks and nuns ran to the great church they both men and women were holding in their arms their infants what a spectacle that street was crowded full of human beings he attributes their change of heart to a prophecy what was the reason that compelled all to flee to the great church they had been listening for many years to some pseudo soothsayers who had declared that the city was destined to be handed over to the turks who would enter in large numbers and would massacre the romans as far as the column of constantine the great after this an angel would descend holding his sword he would hand over the kingdom together with the sword to some insignificant poor and humble man who would happen to be standing by the column he would say to him take this sword and avenge the lord s people then the turks would be turned back would be massacred by the pursuing romans and would be ejected from the city and from all places in the west and the east and would be driven as far as the borders of persia to a place called the lone tree that was the cause for the flight into the great church in one hour that famous and enormous church was filled with men and women an innumerable crowd was everywhere upstairs downstairs in the courtyards and in every conceivable place they closed the gates and stood there hoping for salvation in accordance with the traditional custom of the time sultan mehmed ii allowed his troops and his entourage three full days of unbridled pillage and looting in the city shortly after it was captured this period saw the destruction of many orthodox churches hagia sophia itself was looted as the invaders believed it to contain the greatest treasures of the city shortly after the defence of the walls of constantinople collapsed and the victorious ottoman troops entered the city the pillagers and looters made their way to the hagia sophia and battered down its doors before storming inside once the three days passed mehmed was to claim the city s remaining contents for himself however by the end of the first day he proclaimed that the looting should cease as he felt profound sadness when he toured the looted and enslaved city throughout the siege of constantinople the trapped people of the city participated in the divine liturgy and the prayer of the hours at the hagia sophia and the church was a safe haven and a refuge for many of those who were unable to contribute to the city s defence including women children elderly the sick and the wounded as they were trapped in the church the many congregants and other refugees inside became spoils of war to be divided amongst the triumphant invaders the building was desecrated and looted and those who sought shelter within the church were enslaved while most of the elderly and the infirm injured and sick were killed the remainder mainly teenage males and young boys were chained and sold into slavery constantinople fell to the attacking ottoman forces on may sultan mehmed ii entered the city and performed the friday prayer and khutbah sermon in hagia sophia and this action marked the official conversion of hagia sophia into a mosque the church s priests and religious personnel continued to perform christian rites prayers and ceremonies until they were compelled to stop by the invaders when mehmed and his entourage entered the church he ordered that it be converted into a mosque immediately one of the ulam islamic scholars present climbed

completed between and by eight hundred workers under the supervision of the swiss italian architect brothers gaspare and giuseppe fossati the brothers consolidated the dome with a restraining iron chain and strengthened the vaults straightened the columns and revised the decoration of the exterior and the interior of the building the mosaics in the upper gallery were exposed and cleaned although many were recovered for protection against further damage eight new gigantic circular framed discs or medallions were hung from the cornice on each of the four piers and at either side of the apse and the west doors these were designed by the calligrapher kazasker mustafa izzet efendi and painted with the names of allah muhammad the rashidun the first four caliphs abu bakr umar uthman and

the carpet and the layer of mortar underneath were removed and marble floor decorations such as the omphalion appeared for the first time since the fossatis restoration when the white plaster covering many of the mosaics had been removed due to neglect the condition of the structure continued to deteriorate prompting the world monuments fund wmf to include the hagia sophia in their and watch lists during this time period the building s copper roof had cracked causing water to leak down over the fragile frescoes and mosaics moisture entered from below as well rising ground water increased the level of humidity within the monument creating an unstable environment for stone and paint the wmf secured a series of grants from to for the restoration of the dome the first stage of work involved the structural stabilization and repair of the cracked roof which was undertaken with the participation of the turkish ministry of culture and tourism the second phase the preservation of the dome s interior afforded the opportunity to employ and train young turkish conservators in the care of mosaics by the wmf project was complete though many areas of hagia sophia continue to require significant stability improvement restoration and conservation in hagia sophia was the second most visited museum in turkey attracting almost million visitors annually while use of the complex as a place of worship mosque or church was strictly prohibited in the turkish government allowed the allocation of a pavilion in the museum complex ayasofya m zesi h nkar kasr for use as a prayer room and

as we do in all our mosques on june john haldon president of the international association of byzantine studies wrote an open letter to erdo an asking that he consider the value of keeping the aya sofya as a museum on july the decision of the council of ministers to transform the hagia sophia into a museum was annulled by the council of state decreeing that hagia sophia cannot be used for any other purpose than being a mosque and that the hagia sophia was property of the fatih sultan mehmet han foundation the council reasoned ottoman sultan mehmet ii who conquered istanbul deemed the property to be used by the public as a mosque without any fees and was not within the jurisdiction of the parliament or a ministry council despite secular and global criticism erdo an signed a decree annulling the hagia sophia s museum status reverting it to a mosque the call to prayer was broadcast from the minarets shortly after the announcement of the change and rebroadcast by major turkish

changed hagia sophia from a mosque to a museum honouring all previous greek orthodox and latin catholic history making it as a sign of turkish modern secularism on july erdo an announced that the first prayers in the hagia sophia would be open to between and worshippers he said that turkey had sovereign power over hagia sophia and was thus not subject to international restrictions while the

emblematic monument as the hagia sophia at meeting on july saying it will inevitably fuel the mistrust promote renewed division between religious communities and undermine our efforts at dialog and cooperation and that there was a broad support to call on the turkish authorities to urgently reconsider and reverse this decision greece denounced the conversion and considered it a breach of the unesco world heritage titling greek culture minister lina mendoni called it an open provocation to the civilised world which absolutely confirms that there is no independent justice in erdo an s turkey and that his turkish nationalism takes his country back six centuries greece and cyprus called for eu sanctions on turkey morgan ortagus the spokesperson for the united states department of state noted we are disappointed by the decision by the government of turkey to change the status of the hagia sophia jean yves le drian foreign minister of france said his country deplores the move

as loyal to the turkish government endorsed the decision to convert the museum into a mosque he said i believe that believers praying suits better the spirit of the temple instead of curious tourists running around to take pictures in july unesco asked for an updated report on the state of conservation and expressed grave concern there were also some concerns about the future of its world heritage status turkey responded that the changes had no negative impact on unesco standards and the criticism is biased and political hagia sophia is one of the greatest surviving examples of byzantine architecture its interior is decorated with mosaics marble pillars and coverings of great artistic value justinian had overseen the completion of the greatest cathedral ever built up to that time and it was to remain the largest cathedral for years until the completion of the cathedral in seville in spain the hagia sophia uses masonry construction the structure has brick and mortar joints that are times the width of the bricks the mortar joints are composed of a combination of sand and minute ceramic pieces distributed evenly throughout the mortar joints this combination of sand and potsherds was often used in roman concrete a predecessor to modern concrete a considerable amount of iron was used as well in the form of cramps and ties justinian s basilica was at once the culminating architectural achievement of late antiquity and the first masterpiece of byzantine architecture its influence both architecturally and liturgically was widespread and enduring in the eastern christianity western christianity and islam alike the vast interior has a complex structure the nave is covered by a central dome which at its maximum is m ft in from floor level and rests on an arcade of arched windows repairs to its structure have left the dome somewhat elliptical with the diameter varying between and m ft in and ft in at the western entrance and eastern liturgical side there are arched openings extended by half domes of identical diameter to the central dome carried on smaller semi domed exedrae a hierarchy of dome headed elements built up to create a vast oblong interior crowned by the central dome with a clear span of m ft the theories of hero of alexandria a hellenistic mathematician of the st century ad may have been utilized to address the challenges presented by building such an expansive dome over so large a space svenshon and stiffel proposed that the architects used hero s proposed values for constructing vaults the square measurements were calculated using the side and diagonal number progression which results in squares defined by the numbers and wherein defines the side of the square and its diagonal which have been used as standard values as early as in cuneiform babylonian texts each of the four sides of the great square hagia sophia is approximately m long and it was previously thought that this was the equivalent of byzantine feet svenshon suggested that the size of the side of the central square of hagia sophia is not byzantine feet but instead feet this measurement is not only rational but it is also embedded in the system of the side and diagonal number progression and therefore a usable value by the applied mathematics of antiquity it gives a diagonal of which is manageable for constructing a huge dome like that of the hagia sophia the stone floor of hagia sophia dates from the th century after the first collapse of the vault the broken dome was left in situ on the original justinianic floor and a new floor was laid above the rubble when the dome was rebuilt in from the installation of this second justinianic floor the floor became part of the liturgy with significant locations and spaces demarcated in various ways using different coloured stones and marbles the floor is predominantly made up of proconnesian marble quarried on proconnesus marmara island in the propontis sea of marmara this was the main white marble used in the monuments of constantinople other parts of the floor like the thessalian verd antique marble were quarried in thessaly in roman greece the thessalian verd antique bands across the nave floor were often likened to rivers the floor was praised by numerous authors and repeatedly compared to a sea the justinianic poet paul the silentiary likened the ambo and the solea connecting it to the sanctuary with an island in a sea with the sanctuary itself a harbour the th century narratio writes of it as like the sea or the flowing waters of a river michael the deacon in the th century also described the floor as a sea in which the ambo and other liturgical furniture stood as islands during the th century conquest of constantinople the ottoman caliph mehmed is said to have ascended to the dome and the galleries in order to admire the floor which according to tursun beg resembled a sea in a storm or a petrified sea other ottoman era authors also praised the floor t c z de cafer elebi compared it to waves of marble the floor was hidden beneath a carpet on july the imperial gate or imperial door was the main entrance between the exo and esonarthex and it was originally exclusively used by the emperor a long ramp from the northern part of the outer narthex leads up to the upper gallery citation needed the upper gallery or matroneum is horseshoe shaped it encloses the nave on three sides and is interrupted by the apse several mosaics are preserved in the upper gallery an area traditionally reserved for the empress and her court the best preserved mosaics are located in the southern part of the gallery the northern first floor gallery contains runic graffiti believed to have been left by members of the varangian guard structural damage caused by natural disasters is visible on the hagia sophia s exterior surface to ensure that the hagia sophia did not sustain any damage on the interior of the building studies have been conducted using ground penetrating radar within the gallery of the hagia sophia with the use of ground penetrating radar gpr teams discovered weak zones within the hagia sophia s gallery and also concluded that the curvature of the vault dome has been shifted out of proportion compared to its original angular orientation the dome of hagia sophia has spurred particular interest for many art historians architects and engineers because of the innovative way the original architects envisioned it the dome is carried on four spherical triangular pendentives making the hagia sophia one of the first large scale uses of this element the pendentives are the corners of the square base of the dome and they curve upwards into the dome to support it thus restraining the lateral forces of the dome and allowing its weight to flow downwards the main dome of the hagia sophia was the largest pendentive dome in the world until the completion of st peter s basilica and it has a much lower height than any other dome of such a large diameter the great dome at the hagia sophia is meters one hundred and seven feet in diameter and is only meters two feet thick the main building materials for the original hagia sophia were brick and mortar brick aggregate was used to make roofs easier to construct the aggregate weighs kilograms per cubic meter pounds per cubic foot an average weight of masonry construction at the time due to the materials plasticity it was chosen over cut stone due to the fact that aggregate can be used over a longer distance according to rowland mainstone it is unlikely that the vaulting shell is anywhere more than one normal brick in thickness the weight of the dome remained a problem for most of the building s existence the original cupola collapsed entirely after the earthquake of in a new dome was built by isidore the younger a nephew of isidore of miletus unlike the original this included ribs and was raised meters feet in order to lower the lateral forces on the church walls a larger section of the second dome collapsed as well over two episodes so that as of only two sections of the present dome the north and south sides are from the reconstructions of the whole dome s ribs the surviving north section contains eight ribs while the south section includes six ribs although this design stabilizes the dome and the surrounding walls and arches the actual construction of the walls of hagia sophia weakened the overall structure the bricklayers used more mortar than brick which is more effective if the mortar was allowed to settle as the building would have been more flexible however the builders did not allow the mortar to cure before they began the next layer when the dome was erected its weight caused the walls to lean outward because of the wet mortar underneath when isidore the younger rebuilt the fallen cupola he had first to build up the interior of the walls to make them vertical again additionally the architect raised the height of the rebuilt dome by approximately metres ft so that the lateral forces would not be as strong and its weight would be transmitted more effectively down into the walls moreover he shaped the new cupola like a scalloped shell or the inside of an umbrella with ribs that extend from the top down to the base these ribs allow the weight of the dome to flow between the windows down the pendentives and ultimately to the foundation hagia sophia is famous for the light that reflects everywhere in the interior of the nave giving the dome the appearance of hovering above this effect was achieved by inserting forty windows around the base of the original structure moreover the insertion of the windows in the dome structure reduced its weight numerous buttresses have been added throughout the centuries the flying buttresses to the west of the building although thought to have been constructed by the crusaders upon their visit to constantinople were actually built during the byzantine era this shows that the romans had prior knowledge of flying buttresses which can also be seen at in greece at the rotunda of galerius in thessaloniki at the monastery of hosios loukas in boeotia and in italy at the octagonal basilica of san vitale in ravenna other buttresses were constructed during the ottoman times under the guidance of the architect sinan a total of buttresses were added the minarets were an ottoman addition and not part of the original church s byzantine design they were built for notification of invitations for prayers adhan and announcements mehmed had built a wooden minaret over one of the half domes soon after hagia sophia s conversion from a cathedral to a mosque this minaret does not exist today one of the minarets at southeast was built from red brick and can be dated back from the reign of mehmed or his successor beyaz d ii the other three were built from white limestone and sandstone of which the slender northeast column was erected by bayezid ii and the two identical larger minarets to the west were erected by selim ii and designed by the famous ottoman architect mimar sinan both are metres ft in height and their thick and massive patterns complete hagia sophia s main structure many ornaments and details were added to these minarets on repairs during the th th and th centuries which reflect each period s characteristics and ideals originally under justinian s reign the interior decorations consisted of abstract designs on marble slabs on the walls and floors as well as mosaics on the curving vaults of these mosaics the two archangels gabriel and michael are still visible in the spandrels corners of the bema there were already a few figurative decorations as attested by the late th century ekphrasis of paul the silentiary the description of hagia sophia the spandrels of the gallery are faced in inlaid thin slabs opus sectile showing patterns and figures of flowers and birds in precisely cut pieces of white marble set against a background of black marble in later stages figurative mosaics were added which were destroyed during the iconoclastic controversy present mosaics are from the post iconoclastic period apart from the mosaics many figurative decorations were added during the second half of the th century an image of christ in the central dome eastern orthodox saints prophets and church fathers in the tympana below historical figures connected with this church such as patriarch ignatius and some scenes from the gospels in the galleries basil ii let artists paint a giant six winged seraph on each of the four pendentives the ottomans covered their faces with golden stars but in one of them was restored to its original state the loggia of the empress is located in the centre of the gallery of the hagia sophia above the imperial gate and directly opposite the apse from this matroneum women s gallery the empress and the court ladies would watch the proceedings down below a green stone disc of verd antique marks the spot where the throne of the empress stood two huge marble lustration ritual purification urns were brought from pergamon during the reign of sultan murad iii they are from the hellenistic period and carved from single blocks of marble the marble door inside the hagia sophia is located in the southern upper enclosure or gallery it was used by the participants in synods who entered and left the meeting chamber through this door it is said by whom that each side is symbolic and that one side represents heaven while the other represents hell its panels are covered in fruits and fish motifs the door opens into a space that was used as a venue for solemn meetings and important resolutions of patriarchate officials the nice door is the oldest architectural element found in the hagia sophia dating back to the nd century bc the decorations are of reliefs of geometric shapes as well as plants that are believed to have come from a pagan temple in tarsus in cilicia part of the cibyrrhaeot theme in modern day mersin province in south eastern turkey it was incorporated into the building by emperor theophilos in where it is placed in the south exit in the inner narthex the imperial gate is the door that was used solely by the emperor and his personal bodyguard and retinue it is the largest door in the hagia sophia and has been dated to the th century it is about meters long and byzantine sources say it was made with wood from noah s ark in april the door was vandalised by unknown assailant s the incident became known after the association of art historians published a photo with the destruction greek foreign ministry condemned the incident while turkish officials claimed that a citizen has taken a piece of the door and started an investigation at the northwest of the building there is a column with a hole in the middle covered by bronze plates this column goes by different names the perspiring or sweating column the crying column or the wishing column legend states that it has been moist since the appearance of gregory the wonderworker near the column in it is believed that touching the moisture cures many illnesses the first mosaics which adorned the church were completed during the reign of justin ii many of the non figurative mosaics in the church come from this period most of the mosaics however were created in the th and th centuries better source needed following the periods of byzantine iconoclasm during the sack of constantinople in the latin crusaders vandalized valuable items in every important byzantine structure of the city including the golden mosaics of the hagia sophia many of these items were shipped to venice whose doge enrico dandolo had organized the invasion and sack of constantinople after an agreement with prince alexios angelos the son of a deposed byzantine emperor following the building s conversion into a mosque in many of its mosaics were covered with plaster due to islam s ban on representational imagery this process was not completed at once and reports exist from the th century in which travellers note that they could still see christian images in the former church in the building was restored by two swiss italian fossati brothers gaspare and giuseppe and sultan abdulmejid i allowed them to also document any mosaics they might discover during this process which were later archived in swiss libraries better source needed this work did not include repairing the mosaics and after recording the details about an image the fossatis painted it over again the fossatis restored the mosaics of the two hexapteryga singular greek pr hexapterygon six winged angel it is uncertain whether they are seraphim or cherubim located on the two east pendentives and covered their faces again before the end of the restoration the other two mosaics placed on the west pendentives are copies in paint created by the fossatis since they could find no surviving remains of them as in this case the architects reproduced in paint damaged decorative mosaic patterns sometimes redesigning them in the process the fossati records are the primary sources about a number of mosaic images now believed to have been completely or partially destroyed in the istanbul earthquake these include a mosaic over a now unidentified door of the poor a large image of a jewel encrusted cross and many images of angels saints patriarchs and church fathers most of the missing images were located in the building s two tympana one mosaic they documented is christ pantocrator in a circle which would indicate it to be a ceiling mosaic possibly even of the main dome which was later covered and painted over with islamic calligraphy that expounds god as the light of the universe the fossatis drawings of the hagia sophia mosaics are today kept in the archive of the canton of ticino many mosaics were uncovered in the s by a team from the byzantine institute of america led by thomas whittemore the team chose to let a number of simple cross images remain covered by plaster but uncovered all major mosaics found because of its long history as both a church and a mosque a particular challenge arises in the restoration process christian iconographic mosaics can be uncovered but often at the expense of important and historic islamic art restorers have attempted to maintain a balance between both christian and islamic cultures in particular much controversy rests upon whether the islamic calligraphy on the dome of the cathedral should be removed in order to permit the underlying pantocrator mosaic of christ as master of the world to be exhibited assuming the mosaic still exists the hagia sophia has been a victim of natural disasters that have caused deterioration to the buildings structure and walls the deterioration of the hagia sophia s walls can be directly attributed to salt crystallization the crystallization of salt is due to an intrusion of rainwater that causes the hagia sophia s deteriorating inner and outer walls diverting excess rainwater is the main solution to the deteriorating walls at the hagia sophia built between and a subsurface structure under the hagia sophia has been under investigation using lacoste romberg gravimeters to determine the depth of the subsurface structure and to discover other hidden cavities beneath the hagia sophia the hidden cavities have also acted as a support system against earthquakes with these findings using the lacoste romberg gravimeters it was also discovered that the hagia sophia s foundation is built on a slope of natural rock the imperial gate mosaic is located in the tympanum above that gate which was used only by the emperors when entering the church based on style analysis it has been dated to the late th or early th century the emperor with a nimbus or halo could possibly represent emperor leo vi the wise or his son constantine vii porphyrogenitus bowing down before christ pantocrator seated on a jewelled throne giving his blessing and holding in his left hand an open book the text on the book reads peace be with you john and i am the light of the world john on each side of christ s shoulders is a circular medallion with busts on his left the archangel gabriel holding a staff on his right his mother mary the southwestern entrance mosaic situated in the tympanum of the southwestern entrance dates from the reign of basil ii it was rediscovered during the restorations of by the fossatis the virgin sits on a throne without a back her feet resting on a pedestal embellished with precious stones the christ child sits on her lap giving his blessing and holding a scroll in his left hand on her left side stands emperor constantine in ceremonial attire presenting a model of the city to mary the inscription next to him says great emperor constantine of the saints on her right side stands emperor justinian i offering a model of the hagia sophia the medallions on both sides of the virgin s head carry the nomina sacra mp and abbreviations of the greek romanized m t r theou lit mother of god the composition of the figure of the virgin enthroned was probably copied from the mosaic inside the semi dome of the apse inside the liturgical space the mosaic in the semi dome above the apse at the east end shows mary mother of jesus holding the christ child and seated on a jewelled thokos backless throne since its rediscovery after a period of concealment in the ottoman era it has become one of the foremost monuments of byzantium the infant jesus s garment is depicted with golden tesserae guillaume joseph grelot fr who had travelled to constantinople in engraved and in published in paris an image of the interior of hagia sophia which shows the apse mosaic indistinctly together with a picture by cornelius loos drawn in these images are early attestations of the mosiac before it was covered towards the end of the th century the mosaic of the virgin and child was rediscovered during the restorations of the fossati brothers in and revealed by the restoration of thomas whittemore in it was studied again in with the aid of scaffolding it is not known when this mosaic was installed according to cyril mango the mosaic is a curious reflection on how little we know about byzantine art the work is generally believed to date from after the end of byzantine iconoclasm and usually dated to the patriarchate of photius i r and the time of the emperors michael iii r and basil i r most specifically the mosaic has been connected with a surviving homily known to have been written and delivered by photius in the cathedral on march other scholars have favoured earlier or later dates for the present mosaic or its composition nikolaos oikonomides pointed out that photius s homily refers to standing portrait of the theotokos a hodegetria while the present mosaic shows her seated likewise a biography of the patriarch isidore i r by his successor philotheus i r composed before describes isidore seeing a standing image of the virgin at epiphany in serious damage was done to the building by earthquakes in the th century and it is possible that a standing image of the virgin that existed in photius s time was lost in the earthquake of in which the eastern end of hagia sophia was partly destroyed this interpretation supposes that the present mosaic of the virgin and child enthroned is of the late th century a time in which beginning with nilus of constantinople r the patriarchs of constantinople began to have official seals depicting the theotokos enthroned on a thokos still other scholars have proposed an earlier date than the later th century according to george galavaris the mosaic seen by photius was a hodegetria portrait which after the earthquake of was replaced by the present image not later than the early th century according to oikonomides however the image in fact dates to before the triumph of orthodoxy having been completed c during the iconodule interlude between the first iconoclast and the second iconoclast periods having been plastered over in the second iconoclasm oikonomides argues a new standing image of the virgin hodegetria was created above the older mosaic in which then fell off in the earthquakes of the s and revealed again the late th century image of the virgin enthroned more recently analysis of a hexaptych menologion icon panel from saint catherine s monastery at mount sinai has determined that the panel showing numerous scenes from the life of the virgin and other theologically significant iconic representations contains an image at the centre very similar to that in hagia sophia the image is labelled in greek merely as romanized m t r theou lit mother of god but in the georgian language the inscription reveals the image is labelled of the semi dome of hagia sophia this image is therefore the oldest depiction of the apse mosaic known and demonstrates that the apse mosaic s appearance was similar to the present day mosaic in the late th or early th centuries when the hexaptych was inscribed in georgian by a georgian monk which rules out a th century date for the mosaic the portraits of the archangels gabriel and michael largely destroyed in the bema of the arch also date from the th century the mosaics are set against the original golden background of the th century these mosaics were believed to be a reconstruction of the mosaics of the th century that were previously destroyed during the iconoclastic era by the byzantines of that time as represented in the inaugural sermon by the patriarch photios however no record of figurative decoration of hagia sophia exists before this time the emperor alexander mosaic is not easy to find for the first time visitor located on the second floor in a dark corner of the ceiling it depicts the emperor alexander in full regalia holding a scroll in his right hand and a globus cruciger in his left a drawing by the fossatis showed that the mosaic survived until and that thomas whittemore founder of the byzantine institute of america who was granted permission to preserve the mosaics assumed that it had been destroyed in the earthquake of eight years after his death the mosaic was discovered in largely through the researches of robert van nice unlike most of the other mosaics in hagia sophia which had been covered over by ordinary plaster the alexander mosaic was simply painted over and reflected the surrounding mosaic patterns and thus was well hidden it was duly cleaned by the byzantine institute s successor to whittemore paul a underwood the empress zoe mosaic on the eastern wall of the southern gallery dates from the th century christ pantocrator clad in the dark blue robe as is the custom in byzantine art is seated in the middle against a golden background giving his blessing with the right hand and holding the bible in his left hand on either side of his head are the nomina sacra ic and xc meaning i sous christos he is flanked by constantine ix monomachus and empress zoe both in ceremonial costumes he is offering a purse as a symbol of donation he made to the church while she is holding a scroll symbol of the donations she made the inscription over the head of the emperor says constantine pious emperor in christ the god king of the romans monomachus the inscription over the head of the empress reads as follows zo the very pious augusta the previous heads have been scraped off and replaced by the three present ones perhaps the earlier mosaic showed her first husband romanus iii argyrus or her second husband michael iv another theory is that this mosaic was made for an earlier emperor and empress with their heads changed into the present ones the comnenus mosaic also located on the eastern wall of the southern gallery dates from the virgin mary is standing in the middle depicted as usual in byzantine art in a dark blue gown she holds the christ child on her lap he gives his blessing with his right hand while holding a scroll in his left hand on her right side stands emperor john ii comnenus represented in a garb embellished with precious stones he holds a purse symbol of an imperial donation to the church his wife the empress irene of hungary stands on the left side of the virgin wearing ceremonial garments and offering a document their eldest son alexius comnenus is represented on an adjacent pilaster he is shown as a beardless youth probably representing his appearance at his coronation aged seventeen in this panel one can already see a difference with the empress zoe mosaic that is one century older there is a more realistic expression in the portraits instead of an idealized representation the empress irene born piroska daughter of ladislaus i of hungary is shown with plaited blond hair rosy cheeks and grey eyes revealing her hungarian descent the emperor is depicted in a dignified manner the de sis mosaic entreaty probably dates from it was commissioned to mark the end of years of latin catholic use and the return to the eastern orthodox faith it is the third panel situated in the imperial enclosure of the upper galleries it is widely considered the finest in hagia sophia because of the softness of the features the humane expressions and the tones of the mosaic the style is close to that of the italian painters of the late th or early th century such as duccio in this panel the virgin mary and john the baptist ioannes prodromos both shown in three quarters profile are imploring the intercession of christ pantocrator for humanity on judgment day the bottom part of this mosaic is badly deteriorated this mosaic is considered as the beginning of a renaissance in byzantine pictorial art the northern tympanum mosaics feature various saints they have been able to survive due to their high and inaccessible location they depict patriarchs of constantinople john chrysostom and ignatius standing clothed in white robes with crosses and holding richly jewelled bibles the figures of each patriarch revered as saints are identifiable by labels in greek the other mosaics in the other tympana have not survived probably due to the frequent earthquakes as opposed to any deliberate destruction by the ottoman conquerors the dome was decorated with four non identical figures of the six winged angels which protect the throne of god it is uncertain whether they are seraphim or cherubim the mosaics survive in the eastern part of the dome but since the ones on the western side were damaged during the byzantine period they have been renewed as frescoes during the ottoman period each seraph s or cherub s face was covered with metallic lids in the shape of stars but these were removed to reveal the faces during renovations in detail of the columns detail of the columns mosaic in the northern tympanum depicting saint john chrysostom six patriarchs mosaic in the southern tympanum as drawn by the

by adriaan reland hagia sophia from the south west hagia sophia in the snow december maschinengewehr mounted on a minaret during world war ii many religious buildings have been modeled on the hagia sophia s core structure of a large central dome resting on pendentives and buttressed by two semi domes byzantine churches modeled on the hagia sophia include the hagia sophia in thessaloniki greece as well as the hagia irene which was remodeled to have a dome similar to that hagia sophia during the reign of justinian several mosques commissioned by the ottoman dynasty have similar measurements to the hagia sophia including the s leymaniye mosque and the bayezid ii mosque ottoman architects preferred to surround the central dome with four semi domes rather than two there are four semi domes on the sultan ahmed mosque the fatih mosque and the new mosque istanbul as in the original plan of the hagia sophia many of these mosques are also entered through a colonnaded courtyard although the courtyard of the hagia sophia no longer exists neo byzantine churches modeled on the hagia sophia include the kronstadt naval cathedral holy trinity cathedral sibiu and poti cathedral which closely replicate the internal geometry of the hagia sophia the interior of the kronstadt naval cathedral is nearly identical to the hagia sophia the marble revetment also closely mimics the source work like ottoman mosques many churches based on the hagia sophia include four semi domes rather than two such as the church of saint sava in belgrade several churches combine the layout of the hagia sophia with a latin cross plan one such church is the cathedral basilica of saint louis st louis where the transept is formed by two semi domes surrounding the main dome this church also closely emulates the column capitals and mosaic styles of the hagia sophia other examples include the alexander nevsky cathedral sofia st sophia s cathedral london saint clement catholic church chicago and basilica of the national shrine of the immaculate conception the catedral metropolitana ortodoxa in s o paulo and the glise du saint esprit paris closely follow the interior layout of the hagia sophia both include four semi domes but the two lateral semi domes are very shallow in terms of size the glise du saint esprit is about two thirds the scale of the hagia sophia synagogues based on the hagia sophia include the congregation emanu el san francisco great synagogue of florence and hurva synagogue articles mosaics

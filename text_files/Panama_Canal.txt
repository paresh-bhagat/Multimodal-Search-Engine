 the panama canal spanish canal de panam is an artificial km mi waterway in panama that connects the atlantic ocean with the pacific ocean and divides north and south america the canal cuts across the isthmus of panama and is a conduit for maritime trade one of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken the panama canal shortcut greatly reduces the time for ships to travel between the atlantic and pacific oceans enabling them to avoid the lengthy hazardous cape horn route around the southernmost tip of south america via the drake passage or strait of magellan and the even less popular route through the arctic archipelago and the bering strait colombia france and later the united states controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction france began work on the canal in but stopped because of lack of investors confidence due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate the united states took over the project on may and opened the canal on august the us continued to control the canal and surrounding panama canal zone until the torrijos carter treaties provided for handover to panama after a period of joint american panamanian control the canal was taken over by the panamanian government in it is now managed and operated by the government owned panama canal authority canal locks at each end lift ships up to gatun lake an artificial lake created to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal meters ft above sea level and then lower the ships at the other end the original locks are meters ft wide a third wider lane of locks was constructed between september and may the expanded waterway began commercial operation on june the new locks allow transit of larger new panamax ships annual traffic has risen from about ships in when the canal opened to vessels in for a total of million panama canal universal measurement system pc ums tons by more than vessels had passed through the canal in it took ships an average of hours to pass between the canal s two locks the american society of civil engineers has ranked the panama canal one of the seven wonders of the modern world the earliest record regarding a canal across the isthmus of panama was in when charles v holy roman emperor and king of spain ordered a survey for a route through the americas in order to ease the voyage for ships traveling between spain and peru the spanish were seeking to gain a military advantage over the portuguese in the english physician and philosopher sir thomas browne speculated in his encyclopedic work pseudodoxia epidemica that some isthmus have been eaten through by the sea and others cut by the spade and if the policy would permit that of panama in america were most worthy the attempt it being but few miles over and would open a shorter cut unto the east indies and china in american thomas jefferson then minister to france suggested that the spanish should build the canal since they controlled the colonies where it would be built he said that this would be a less treacherous route for ships than going around the southern tip of south america and that tropical ocean currents would naturally widen the canal after construction during an expedition from to alessandro malaspina outlined plans for construction of a canal given the strategic location of panama and the potential of its narrow isthmus separating two great oceans other trade links in the area were attempted over the years the ill fated darien scheme was launched by the kingdom of scotland in to set up an overland trade route generally inhospitable conditions thwarted the effort and it was abandoned in april numerous canals were built in other countries in the late th and early th centuries the success of the erie canal through central new york in the united states in the s and the collapse of the spanish empire in latin america resulted in growing american interest in building an inter oceanic canal beginning in us officials began negotiations with gran colombia present day colombia venezuela ecuador and panama hoping to gain a concession to build a canal jealous of their newly gained independence and fearing domination by the more powerful united states president sim n bol var and new granada officials declined american offers after the collapse of gran colombia new granada remained unstable under constant government intrigue citation needed great britain attempted to develop a canal in according to the new york daily tribune august barings bank of london and the republic of new granada entered into a contract for the construction of a canal across the isthmus of darien isthmus of panama they referred to it as the atlantic and pacific canal and it was a wholly british endeavor projected for completion in five years the plan was never carried out at nearly the same time other ideas were floated including a canal and or a railroad across mexico s isthmus of tehuantepec that did not develop either in the mallarino bidlack treaty negotiated between the us and new granada granted the united states transit rights and the right to intervene militarily in the isthmus in the discovery of gold in california on the west coast of the united states generated renewed interest in a canal crossing between the atlantic and pacific oceans william h aspinwall who had won the federal subsidy to build and operate the pacific mail steamships at around the same time benefited from the gold discovery aspinwall s route included steamship legs from new york city to panama and from panama to california with an overland portage through panama this route with an overland leg in panama was soon frequently traveled as it provided one of the fastest connections between san francisco california and the east coast cities about days transit in total nearly all the gold that was shipped out of california went by the fast panama route several new and larger paddle steamers were soon plying this new route including private steamship lines owned by american entrepreneur cornelius vanderbilt that made use of an overland route through nicaragua and the unfortunate ss central america page needed in the united states began construction of the panama railroad now called the panama railway to cross the isthmus it opened in this overland link became a vital piece of western hemisphere infrastructure greatly facilitating trade the later canal route was constructed parallel to it as it had helped clear dense forests citation needed an all water route between the oceans was still the goal in william kennish a manx born engineer working for the united states government surveyed the isthmus and issued a report on a route for a proposed panama canal his report was published as a book entitled the practicability and importance of a ship canal to connect the atlantic and pacific oceans page needed in lucien napol on bonaparte wyse and his chief assistant armand r clus both officers and engineers of the french navy explored several routes in the darien atrato regions and made proposals including the construction of tunnels and locks page needed a second isthmian exploratory visit began on december where two routes were explored in panama the san blas route and a route from limon bay to panama city the current canal route the french had achieved success in building the suez canal in the middle east while it was a lengthy project they were encouraged to plan for a canal to cross the panamanian isthmus wyse went to bogot and on march signed a treaty in the name of the soci t civile internationale du canal interoc anique par l isthme du darien headed by general tienne t rr with the colombian government known as the wyse concession to build an interoceanic canal through panama the first attempt to construct a canal through what was then colombia s province of panama began on january the project was inspired by the diplomat ferdinand de lesseps who was able to raise considerable funds in france as a result of the huge profits generated by his successful construction of the suez canal although the panama canal needed to be only percent as long as the suez canal it was much more of an engineering challenge due to the combination of tropical rain forests debilitating climate the need for canal locks and the lack of any ancient route to follow lesseps wanted a sea level canal like the suez but he visited the site only a few times during the dry season which lasts only four months of the year his men were totally unprepared for the rainy season during which the chagres river where the canal started became a raging torrent rising up to m ft the dense jungle was alive with venomous snakes insects and spiders but the worst challenges were yellow fever malaria and other tropical diseases which killed thousands of workers by the death rate was over per month public health measures were ineffective because the role of the mosquito as a disease vector was then unknown conditions were downplayed in france to avoid recruitment problems but the high mortality rate made it difficult to maintain an experienced workforce workers had to continually widen the main cut through the mountain at culebra and reduce the angles of the slopes to minimize landslides into the canal steam shovels were used in the construction of the canal purchased from bay city industrial works a business owned by william l clements in bay city michigan bucket chain excavators manufactured by both alphonse couvreux and wehyer richemond and buette were also used other mechanical and electrical equipment was limited in capabilities and steel equipment rusted rapidly in the rainy climate in france lesseps kept the investment and supply of workers flowing long after it was obvious that the targets were not being met but eventually the money ran out the french effort went bankrupt in after reportedly spending us an estimated men died from disease and accidents and the savings of investors were lost work was suspended on may and in the ensuing scandal known as the panama affair some of those deemed responsible were prosecuted including gustave eiffel lesseps and his son charles were found guilty of misappropriation of funds and sentenced to five years imprisonment this sentence was later overturned and the father at age was never imprisoned in a second french company the compagnie nouvelle du canal de panama was created to take over the project a minimal workforce of a few thousand people was employed primarily to comply with the terms of the colombian panama canal concession to run the panama railroad and to maintain the existing excavation and equipment in salable condition the company sought a buyer for these assets with an asking price of us in the meantime they continued with enough activity to maintain their franchise phillipe bunau varilla the french manager of the new panama canal company eventually managed to persuade lesseps that a lock and lake canal was more realistic than a sea level canal the comit technique a high level technical committee was formed by the compagnie nouvelle to review the studies and work that already finished and that still ongoing and come up with the best plan for completing the canal the committee arrived on the isthmus in february and went immediately quietly and efficiently about their work of devising the best possible canal plan which they presented on november many aspects of the plan were similar in principle to the canal that was finally built by the americans in it was a lock canal with two high level lakes to lift ships up and over the continental divide double locks would be feet long and about feet deep m m one chamber of each pair would be feet m wide the other ft m there would be eight sets of locks two at bohio soldado and two at obispo on the atlantic side one at paraiso two at pedro miguel and one at miraflores on the pacific artificial lakes would be formed by damming the chagres river at bohio and alhajuela providing both flood control and electric power at this time the president and the senate of the united states were interested in establishing a canal across the isthmus with some favoring a canal across nicaragua and others advocating the purchase of the french interests in panama bunau varilla who was seeking american involvement asked for million but accepted million in the face of the nicaraguan option in june the us senate voted in favor of the spooner act to pursue the panamanian option provided the necessary rights could be obtained on january the hay herr n treaty was signed by united states secretary of state john m hay and colombian charg dr tom s herr n for million and an annual payment it would have granted the united states a renewable lease in perpetuity from colombia on the land proposed for the canal the treaty was ratified by the us senate on march but the senate of colombia did not ratify it bunau varilla told president theodore roosevelt and hay of a possible revolt by panamanian rebels who aimed to separate from colombia and hoped that the united states would support the rebels with us troops and money citation needed roosevelt changed tactics based in part on the mallarino bidlack treaty of and actively supported the separation of panama from colombia shortly after recognizing panama he signed a treaty with the new panamanian government under terms similar to the hay herr n treaty on november us warships blocked sea lanes against possible colombian troop movements en route to put down the panama rebellion panama declared independence on november the united states quickly recognized the new nation this happened so quickly that by the time the colombian government in bogot launched a response to the panamanian uprising us troops had already entered the rebelling province it should also be stated that the colombian troops dispatched to panama were hastily assembled conscripts with little training while these conscripts may have been able to defeat the panamanian rebels they would not have been able to defeat the us army troops that were supporting the panamanian rebels the reason an army of conscripts was sent was that it was the best response the colombians could muster as colombia still was recovering from a civil war between liberals and conservatives from october to november known as the thousand days war with the us being fully aware of these conditions and even incorporating them into the planning of the panama intervention as the us acted as an arbitrator between the two sides with the peace treaty that ended the thousand days war being signed on the uss wisconsin on november while in port the us also brought engineering teams to panama with the peace delegation to begin planning for the canal s construction before the us had even gained the rights to build the canal all these factors would result in the colombians being unable to put down the panamanian rebellion and expel the united states troops occupying what today is the independent nation of panama on november philippe bunau varilla as panama s ambassador to the united states signed the hay bunau varilla treaty granting rights to the united states to build and indefinitely administer the panama canal zone and its defenses this is sometimes misinterpreted as the year lease because of misleading wording included in article of the agreement almost immediately the treaty was condemned by many panamanians as an infringement on their country s new national sovereignty this would later become a contentious diplomatic issue among colombia panama and the united states president roosevelt famously stated i took the isthmus started the canal and then left congress not to debate the canal but to debate me several parties in the united states called this an act of war on colombia the new york times described the support given by the united states to bunau varilla as an act of sordid conquest citation needed the new york evening post called it a vulgar and mercenary venture citation needed the us maneuvers are often cited as the classic example of us gunboat diplomacy in latin america and the best illustration of what roosevelt meant by the old african adage speak softly and carry a big stick and you will go far after the revolution in the republic of panama became a us protectorate until in the united states purchased the french equipment and excavations including the panama railroad for us million of which million related to excavations completed primarily in the culebra cut valued at about per cubic yard the united states also paid the new country of panama million and a payment each following year in colombia and the united states entered into the thomson urrutia treaty in which the united states agreed to pay colombia million million upon ratification and four million annual payments and grant colombia special privileges in the canal zone in return colombia recognized panama as an independent nation the us formally took control of the canal property on may inheriting from the french a depleted workforce and a vast jumble of buildings infrastructure and equipment much of it in poor condition a us government commission the isthmian canal commission icc was established to oversee construction it was given control of the panama canal zone over which the united states exercised sovereignty the commission reported directly to secretary of war william howard taft and was directed to avoid the inefficiency and corruption that had plagued the french years earlier on may president theodore roosevelt appointed john findley wallace formerly chief engineer and finally general manager of the illinois central railroad as chief engineer of the panama canal project overwhelmed by the disease plagued country and forced to use often dilapidated french infrastructure and equipment as well as being frustrated by the overly bureaucratic icc wallace resigned abruptly in june he was succeeded by john frank stevens a self educated engineer who had built the great northern railroad stevens was not a member of the icc he increasingly viewed its bureaucracy as a serious hindrance bypassing the commission and sending requests and demands directly to the roosevelt administration in washington dc one of stevens first achievements in panama was in building and rebuilding the housing cafeterias hotels water systems repair shops warehouses and other infrastructure needed by the thousands of incoming workers stevens began the recruitment effort to entice thousands of workers from the united states and other areas to come to the canal zone to work workers from the caribbean called afro panamanians came in large numbers and many settled permanently stevens tried to provide accommodation in which the workers could work and live in reasonable safety and comfort he also re established and enlarged the railway which was to prove crucial in transporting millions of tons of soil from the cut through the mountains to the dam across the chagres river colonel william c gorgas had been appointed chief sanitation officer of the canal construction project in gorgas implemented a range of measures to minimize the spread of deadly diseases particularly yellow fever and malaria which had recently been shown to be mosquito borne following the work of dr carlos finlay and dr walter reed investment was made in extensive sanitation projects including city water systems fumigation of buildings spraying of insect breeding areas with oil and larvicide installation of mosquito netting and window screens and elimination of stagnant water despite opposition from the commission one member said his ideas were barmy gorgas persisted and when stevens arrived he threw his weight behind the project after two years of extensive work the mosquito spread diseases were nearly eliminated even after all that effort about workers died of disease and accidents during the us construction phase of the canal in a us engineering panel was commissioned to review the canal design which had not been finalized in january the panel in a majority of eight to five recommended to president roosevelt a sea level canal as had been attempted by the french and temporarily abandoned by them in for a ten locks system designed by philippe bunau varilla and definitively in for a lock and lake canal designed by the comit technique of the compagnie nouvelle de canal de panama as conceptualized by adolphe godin de l pinay in but in stevens who had seen the chagres in full flood was summoned to washington he declared a sea level approach to be an entirely untenable proposition he argued in favor of a canal using a lock system to raise and lower ships from a large reservoir ft m above sea level this would create both the largest dam gatun dam and the largest human made lake gatun lake in the world at that time the water to refill the locks would be taken from gatun lake by opening and closing enormous gates and valves and letting gravity propel the water from the lake gatun lake would connect to the pacific through the mountains at the gaillard culebra cut unlike godin de l pinay with the congr s international d etudes du canal interoc anique stevens successfully convinced roosevelt of the necessity and feasibility of this alternative scheme the construction of a canal with locks required the excavation of more than million cu yd million m of material over and above the million cu yd million m excavated by the french as quickly as possible the americans replaced or upgraded the old unusable french equipment with new construction equipment that was designed for a much larger and faster scale of work large railroad mounted steam shovels were purchased from bucyrus erie and from the marion power shovel company these were joined by enormous steam powered cranes giant hydraulic rock crushers concrete mixers dredges and pneumatic power drills nearly all of which were manufactured by new extensive machine building technology developed and built in the united states the railroad also had to be comprehensively upgraded with heavy duty double tracked rails over most of the line to accommodate new rolling stock in many places the new gatun lake flooded over the original rail line and a new line had to be constructed above gatun lake s waterline in stevens resigned as chief engineer his replacement appointed by president theodore roosevelt was us army major george washington goethals of the us army corps of engineers soon to be promoted to lieutenant colonel and later to general he was a strong west point trained leader and civil engineer with experience in canals unlike stevens goethals directed the work in panama to a successful conclusion in two years ahead of the target date of june goethals divided the engineering and excavation work into three divisions atlantic central and pacific the atlantic division under major william l sibert was responsible for construction of the massive breakwater at the entrance to limon bay the gatun locks and their mile km approach channel and the immense gatun dam the pacific division under sydney b williamson the only civilian member of this high level team was similarly responsible for the pacific mile km breakwater in panama bay the approach channel to the locks and the miraflores and pedro miguel locks and their associated dams and reservoirs the central division under major david du bose gaillard of the united states army corps of engineers was assigned one of the most difficult parts excavating the culebra cut through the continental divide to connect gatun lake to the pacific panama canal locks on october president woodrow wilson sent a signal from the white house by telegraph which triggered the explosion that destroyed the gamboa dike this flooded the culebra cut thereby joining the atlantic and pacific oceans via the panama canal alexandre la valley a floating crane built by lobnitz company and launched in was the first self propelled vessel to transit the canal from ocean to ocean this vessel crossed the canal from the atlantic in stages during construction finally reaching the pacific on january ss cristobal a cargo and passenger ship built by maryland steel and launched in as ss tremont on august was the first ship to transit the canal from ocean to ocean the construction of the canal was completed in years after panama was first crossed overland by europeans by vasco n ez de balboa s party of conquistadores the united states spent almost million roughly equivalent to billion in to finish the project this was by far the largest american engineering project to date the canal was formally opened on august with the passage of the cargo ship ss ancon the opening of the panama canal in caused a severe drop in traffic along chilean ports due to shifts in maritime trade routes despite the closure of the canal for nearly seven months after a land slide in the culebra cut on september the burgeoning sheep farming business in southern patagonia suffered a significant setback by the change in trade routes as did the economy of the falkland islands throughout this time ernest red hallen was hired by the isthmian canal commission to document the progress of the work in steam shovels from the panama canal were purchased and put to use in chuquicamata copper mine of northern chile a marion steam shovel excavating the panama canal in the panama canal locks under construction in the first ship to transit the canal the ss ancon passes through on august spanish laborers working on the panama canal in early s by the s water supply became an issue for the canal prompting construction of the madden dam across the chagres river above gatun lake completed in the dam created madden lake later alajuela lake which provides additional water storage for the canal in construction began on a further major improvement a new set of locks large enough to carry the larger warships that the united states was building at the time and planned to continue building the work proceeded for several years and significant excavation was carried out on the new approach channels but the project was canceled after world war ii after world war ii us control of the canal and the canal zone surrounding it became contentious relations between panama and the united states became increasingly tense many panamanians felt that the zone rightfully belonged to panama student protests were met by the fencing in of the zone and an increased military presence there demands for the united states to hand over the canal to panama increased after the suez crisis in when the united states used financial and diplomatic pressure to force france and the uk to abandon their attempt to retake control of the suez canal previously nationalized by the nasser regime in egypt panamanian unrest culminated in riots on martyr s day january when about panamanians and us soldiers were killed citation needed a decade later in negotiations toward a settlement began and resulted in the torrijos carter treaties on september the treaty was signed by president of the united states jimmy carter and omar torrijos de facto leader of panama this mobilized the process of granting the panamanians free control of the canal so long as panama signed a treaty guaranteeing the permanent neutrality of the canal the treaty led to full panamanian control effective at noon on december and the panama canal authority acp assumed command of the waterway the panama canal remains one of the chief revenue sources for panama before this handover the government of panama held an international bid to negotiate a year contract for operation of the container shipping ports located at the canal s atlantic and pacific outlets the contract was not affiliated with the acp or panama canal operations and was won by the firm hutchison whampoa a hong kong based shipping interest owned by li ka shing while globally the atlantic ocean is east of the isthmus and the pacific is west the general direction of the canal passage from the atlantic to the pacific is from northwest to southeast because of the shape of the isthmus at the point the canal occupies the bridge of the americas spanish puente de las am ricas at the pacific side is about a third of a degree east of the col n end on the atlantic side still in formal nautical communications the simplified directions southbound and northbound are used the canal consists of artificial lakes several improved and artificial channels and three sets of locks an additional artificial lake alajuela lake known during the american era as madden lake acts as a reservoir for the canal the layout of the canal as seen by a ship passing from the atlantic to the pacific is thus the total length of the canal is km mi created in by damming the chagres river the gatun lake is a key part of the panama canal providing the millions of liters of water necessary to operate its locks each time a ship passes through at time of formation gatun lake was the largest human made lake in the world the impassable rainforest around the lake has been the best defense of the panama canal today these areas remain practically unscathed by human interference and are one of the few accessible areas where various native central american animal and plant species can be observed undisturbed in their natural habitat the largest island on gatun lake is barro colorado island it was established for scientific study when the lake was formed and is operated by the smithsonian institution many important scientific and biological discoveries of the tropical animal and plant kingdom originated here gatun lake covers about km sq mi a vast tropical ecological zone and part of the atlantic forest corridor ecotourism on the lake has become an industry for panamanians gatun lake also provides drinking water for panama city and col n fishing is one of the primary recreational pursuits on gatun lake non native peacock bass were introduced by accident to gatun lake around by a local businessman and have since flourished to become the dominant angling game fish in gatun lake locally called sargento and believed to be the species cichla pleiozona these peacock bass originate from the amazon rio negro and orinoco river basins where they are considered a premier game fish the size of the locks determines the maximum size ship that can pass through because of the importance of the canal to international trade many ships are built to the maximum size allowed these are known as panamax vessels a panamax cargo ship typically has a deadweight tonnage dwt of tons but its actual cargo is restricted to about tons because of the m ft draft restrictions within the canal the longest ship ever to transit the canal was the san juan prospector now marcona prospector an ore bulk oil carrier that is m ft long with a beam of m ft initially the locks at gatun were designed to be m ft wide in the united states navy requested that an increased width of at least m ft to allow the passage of us naval ships eventually a compromise was made and the locks were built m ft wide each lock is m ft long with the walls ranging in thickness from m ft at the base to m ft at the top the central wall between the parallel locks at gatun is m ft thick and over m ft high the steel lock gates measure an average of m ft thick m ft wide and m ft high panama canal pilots were initially unprepared to handle the significant flight deck overhang of aircraft carriers uss saratoga knocked over all the adjacent concrete lamp posts while passing through the gatun locks for the first time in it is the size of the locks specifically the pedro miguel locks along with the height of the bridge of the americas at balboa that determine the panamax metric and limit the size of ships that may use the canal the third set of locks project has created larger locks allowing bigger ships to transit through deeper and wider channels the allowed dimensions of ships using these locks increased by percent in length percent in beam and percent in draft as defined by new panamax metrics as with a toll road vessels transiting the canal must pay tolls tolls for the canal are set by the panama canal authority and are based on vessel type size and the type of cargo for container ships the toll is assessed on the ship s capacity expressed in twenty foot equivalent units teus one teu being the size of a standard intermodal shipping container effective april this toll went from us per loaded container to per teu capacity plus per loaded container for a potential per teu when the ship is full a panamax container ship may carry up to teu the toll is calculated differently for passenger ships and for container ships carrying no cargo in ballast as of april update the ballast rate is us down from us per teu passenger vessels in excess of tons pc ums pay a rate based on the number of berths that is the number of passengers that can be accommodated in permanent beds the per berth charge since april is for unoccupied berths and for occupied berths in the panamax locks started in this fee has greatly increased the tolls for such ships passenger vessels of less than tons or less than tons per passenger are charged according to the same per ton schedule as are freighters almost all major cruise ships have more than tons per passenger the rule of thumb for cruise line comfort is generally given as a minimum of tons per passenger most other types of vessel pay a toll per pc ums net ton in which one ton is actually a volume of cubic feet m the calculation of tonnage for commercial vessels is quite complex as of fiscal year update this toll is us per ton for the first tons us per ton for the next tons and us per ton thereafter as with container ships reduced tolls are charged for freight ships in ballast respectively on april a more complicated toll system was introduced having the neopanamax locks at a higher rate in some cases natural gas transport as a new separate category and other changes as of october there are modified tolls and categories of tolls in effect small less than ft vessels up to pc ums net tons when carrying passengers or cargo or up to pc ums net tons when in ballast or up to fully loaded displacement tons are assessed minimum tolls based upon their length overall according to the following table as of april morgan adams of los angeles california holds the distinction of paying the first toll received by the united states government for the use of the panama canal by a pleasure boat his boat lasata passed through the zone on august the crossing occurred during a kilometer mile sea voyage from jacksonville florida to los angeles in citation needed the most expensive regular toll for canal passage to date was charged on april to the cruise ship norwegian pearl which paid us the average toll is around us the highest fee for priority passage charged through the transit slot auction system was us paid on august by the panamax tanker erikoussa bypassing a ship queue waiting for the end of maintenance work on the gatun locks and thus avoiding a seven day delay the normal fee would have been just us the lowest toll ever paid was cents equivalent to in by american richard halliburton who swam the panama canal in opponents to the torrijos carter treaties feared that efficiency and maintenance would suffer following the us withdrawal from the panama canal zone however this has been proven not to be the case capitalizing on practices developed during the american administration canal operations are improving under panamanian control canal waters time cwt the average time it takes a vessel to navigate the canal including waiting time is a key measure of efficiency according to the acp since it has ranged between and hours the accident rate has also not changed appreciably in the past decade varying between and accidents each year from about total annual transits an official accident is one in which a formal investigation is requested and conducted increasing volumes of imports from asia which previously landed on us west coast ports are now passing through the canal to the american east coast the total number of ocean going transits increased from in to in falling to in the canal s fiscal year runs from october through september this has been coupled with a steady rise in average ship size and in the numbers of panamax vessels passing through the canal so that the total tonnage carried rose from million pc ums tons in fiscal year to a then record high of million tons in and falling to million tons in tonnage for fiscal and was and million pc ums tons carried on and transits respectively in the first decade after the transfer to panamanian control the panama canal authority acp invested nearly us billion in widening and modernizing the canal with the aim of increasing capacity by percent the acp cites a number of major improvements including the widening and straightening of the culebra cut to reduce restrictions on passing vessels the deepening of the navigational channel in gatun lake to reduce draft restrictions and improve water supply and the deepening of the atlantic and pacific entrances to the canal this is supported by new equipment such as a new drill barge and suction dredger and an increase of the tug boat fleet by percent in addition improvements have been made to the canal s operating machinery including an increased and improved tug locomotive fleet the replacement of more than km mi of locomotive track and new lock machinery controls improvements have been made to the traffic management system to allow more efficient control over ships in the canal in december record breaking rains caused a hour closure of the canal this was the first closure since the united states invasion of panama in the rains also caused an access road to the centenario bridge to collapse the canal handles more vessel traffic than had ever been envisioned by its builders in it was estimated that the maximum capacity of the canal would be around million tons per year as noted above canal traffic in reached million tons of shipping to improve capacity a number of improvements have been made to maximize the use of the locking system these improvements enlarged the capacity from million pcums to pcums these improvements were started before the new locks project and are complementary to it the canal faces increasing competition from other quarters because canal tolls have risen as ships have become larger some critics have suggested that the suez canal is now a viable alternative for cargo en route from asia to the us east coast the panama canal however continues to serve more than of the world s trade routes and the majority of canal traffic comes from the all water route from asia to the us east and gulf coasts citation needed on june nicaragua awarded the hong kong based hknd group a year concession to develop a canal through the country the increasing rate of melting of ice in the arctic ocean has led to speculation that the northwest passage or arctic bridge may become viable for commercial shipping this route would save km mi on the route from asia to europe compared with the panama canal possibly leading to a diversion of some traffic to that route however such a route is beset by unresolved territorial issues and would still hold significant problems owing to ice gatun lake is filled with rainwater and the lake accumulates excess water during wet months the water is lost to the oceans at a rate of m million us gal acre ft per downward lock cycle since a ship will have to go upward to gatun lake first and then descend a single passing will cost double the amount but the same waterflow cycle can be used for another ship passing in the opposite direction the ship s submerged volume is not relevant to this amount of water during the dry season when there is less rainfall there is also a shortage of water in gatun lake as a signatory to the united nations global compact and member of the world business council for sustainable development the acp has developed an environmentally and socially sustainable program for expansion which protects the aquatic and terrestrial resources of the canal watershed the expansion guarantees the availability and quality of water resources by using water saving basins at each new lock these water saving basins diminish water loss and preserve freshwater resources along the waterway by reusing water from the basins into the locks each lock chamber has three water saving basins which reuse percent of the water in each transit there are a total of nine basins for each of the two lock complexes and a total of basins for the entire project the mean sea level at the pacific side is about cm in higher than that of the atlantic side due to differences in ocean conditions such as water density and weather as demand is rising for efficient global shipping of goods the canal is positioned to be a significant feature of world shipping for the foreseeable future however changes in shipping patterns particularly the increasing numbers of larger than panamax ships necessitated changes to the canal for it to retain a significant market share in it was anticipated that by percent of the world s container ships would be too large for the present canal and hence a failure to expand would result in a significant loss of market share the maximum sustainable capacity of the original canal given some relatively minor improvement work was estimated at million pc ums tons per year it was anticipated that this capacity would be reached between and close to percent of transiting vessels were already using the full width of the locks an enlargement scheme similar to the third lock scheme to allow for a greater number of transits and the ability to handle larger ships had been under consideration for some time was approved by the government of panama the cost was estimated at us billion and the expansion allowed to double the canal s capacity allowing more traffic and the passage of longer and wider post panamax ships the proposal to expand the canal was approved in a national referendum by about percent on october the canal expansion was built between and the expansion plan had two new flights of locks built parallel to and operated in addition to the old locks one east of the existing gatun locks and one southwest of the miraflores locks each supported by approach channels each flight ascends from sea level directly to the level of gatun lake the existing two stage ascent at miraflores and pedro miguel locks was not replicated the new lock chambers feature sliding gates doubled for safety and are m ft long m ft wide and m ft deep this allows the transit of vessels with a beam of up to m ft an overall length of up to m ft and a draft of up to m ft equivalent to a container ship carrying around containers each m ft in length teu the new locks are supported by new approach channels including a km mi channel at miraflores from the locks to the gaillard cut skirting miraflores lake each of these channels are m ft wide which will require post panamax vessels to navigate the channels in one direction at a time the gaillard cut and the channel through gatun lake were widened to at least m ft on the straight portions and at least m ft on the bends the maximum level of gatun lake was raised from m ft to m ft each flight of locks is accompanied by nine water reutilization basins three per lock chamber each basin being about m ft wide m ft long and m ft deep these gravity fed basins allow percent of the water used in each transit to be reused the new locks consequently use percent less water per transit than each of the existing lock lanes the deepening of gatun lake and the raising of its maximum water level also provide capacity for significantly more water storage these measures are intended to allow the expanded canal to operate without constructing new reservoirs the estimated cost of the project is us billion the project was designed to allow for an anticipated growth in traffic from million pc ums tons in to nearly million pc ums tons in the expanded canal will have a maximum sustainable capacity of about million pc ums tons per year tolls will continue to be calculated based on vessel tonnage and in some cases depend on the locks used an article in the february issue of popular mechanics magazine described the engineering aspects of the expansion project there is also a follow up article in the february issue of popular mechanics on september thousands of panamanians stood across from para so hill in panama to witness a huge initial explosion and launch of the expansion program the first phase of the project was the dry excavations of the meters feet wide trench connecting the gaillard cut with the pacific coast removing million cubic meters of earth and rock by june a m reinforced concrete monolith had been completed the first of such monoliths which will line the new pacific side lock walls by early july however it was announced that the canal expansion project had fallen six months behind schedule leading expectations for the expansion to open in april rather than october as originally planned by september the new gates were projected to be open for transit at the beginning of it was announced in july that the belgian dredging company jan de nul together with a consortium of contractors consisting of the spanish sacyr vallehermoso the italian impregilo and the panamanian company grupo cusa had been awarded the contract to build the six new locks for us billion which was one billion less than the next highest competing bid due to having a concrete budget percent smaller than that of the next bidder and allotted roughly percent less for steel to reinforce that concrete the contract resulted in million in dredging works over the next few years for the belgian company and a great deal of work for its construction division the design of the locks is a carbon copy of the berendrecht lock which is m wide and m long making it the second largest lock in the world after the kieldrecht lock in the port of antwerp belgium completed in by the port of antwerp which de nul helped build the company still has engineers and specialists who were part of that project in january a contract dispute threatened the progress of the project there was a delay of less than two months however with work by the consortium members reaching goals by june in june flooding of the new locks began first on the atlantic side then on the pacific by then the canal s re inauguration was slated for april on march the expansion inauguration was set for june the new locks opened for commercial traffic on june and the first ship to cross the canal using the third set of locks was a modern new panamax vessel the chinese owned container ship cosco shipping panama the original locks now over years old allow engineers greater access for maintenance and are projected to continue operating indefinitely the total cost is unknown since the expansion s contractors are seeking at least an addition us billion from the canal authority due to excess expenses on july wang jing chairman of the hk nicaragua canal development investment co ltd hknd group advised that a route for nicaragua s proposed canal had been approved the construction work was projected by hknd to begin in and take years although there had been little progress before the project s abandonment the nicaraguan parliament approved plans for the km mi canal through nicaragua and according to the deal the company would have been responsible for operating and maintaining the canal for a year period by may no concrete action had been reportedly taken constructing the canal and further doubts were expressed about its financing in february analysts widely viewed the project as defunct though the head of the project insisted work was on going and hknd retained the legal rights to the concession for the canal as well as side projects despite hknd vanishing in april the nicaraguan government indicates that it will continue with the km sq mi dry land expropriations within nicaragua under land expropriation canal law in colombia s then president juan manuel santos announced a proposal for a km mi railway between colombia s pacific and caribbean coasts however in the director of the colombia china chamber of commerce said the proposal was mentioned in and subsequently had minimal relevance climate change has thinned much of the ice that in the past made this route between the atlantic and pacific oceans impassable satellite navigation can help monitor location of the ice which remains further easing transit a few ships have successfully crossed the previously impossible route since individuals companies and governments have explored the possibility of constructing deep water ports and rail links connecting coasts as a dry canal in guatemala costa rica and el salvador honduras however plans to construct these sea rail sea links have yet to materialize during the last one hundred years the panama canal authority has granted membership in the esteemed order of bearers of the master key of the panama canal and appointed a few honorary lead pilots to employees captains and dignitaries one of the most recent of these were u s federal maritime commissioner louis sola who was awarded for his work for supporting seafarers during the covid pandemic and previously transiting the canal more than times another recent award was to commodore ronald warwick a former master of the cunard liners queen elizabeth and rms queen mary who has traversed the canal more than times and senior captain raffaele minotauro an unlimited oceangoing shipmaster senior grade of the former italian governmental navigation company known as the italian line coordinates n w n w

in the louvre palace originally built in the late th to th century under philip ii remnants of the medieval louvre fortress are visible in the basement of the museum due to urban expansion the fortress eventually lost its defensive function and in francis i converted it into the primary residence of the french kings the building was extended many times to form the present louvre palace in louis xiv chose the palace of versailles for his household leaving the louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection including from a collection of ancient greek and roman sculpture in the building was occupied by the acad mie des inscriptions et belles lettres and the acad mie royale de peinture et de sculpture which in held the first of a series of salons the acad mie remained at the louvre for years during the french revolution the national assembly decreed that the louvre should be used as a museum to display the nation s masterpieces the museum opened on august with an exhibition of paintings the majority of the works being royal and confiscated church property because of structural problems with the building the museum was closed in until the collection was increased under napoleon and the museum was renamed mus e napol on but after napoleon s abdication many works seized by his armies were returned to their original owners the collection was further increased during the reigns of louis xviii and charles x and during the second french empire the museum gained pieces holdings have grown steadily through donations and bequests since the third

the louvre exhibits sculptures objets d art paintings drawings and archaeological finds the louvre museum is located inside the louvre palace in the center of paris adjacent to the tuileries gardens the two nearest m tro stations are louvre rivoli and palais royal mus e du louvre the latter having a direct underground access to the carrousel du louvre commercial mall before the grand louvre overhaul of the late s and s the louvre had several street level entrances most of which are now permanently closed since the museum s main entrance has been the underground space under the louvre pyramid or hall napol on which can be accessed from the pyramid itself from the underground carrousel du louvre or for authorized visitors from the passage richelieu connecting to the nearby rue de rivoli a secondary entrance at the porte des lions near the western end of the denon wing was created in but is not permanently open citation needed the museum s entrance conditions have varied over time initially artists and foreign visitors had privileged access a feature that only disappeared in the s at the time of initial opening in the french republican calendar had imposed ten days weeks french d cades the first six days of which were reserved for visits by artists and foreigners and the last three for visits by the general public in the early s after the seven day week had been reinstated the general public had only four hours of museum access per weeks between pm and pm on saturdays and sundays in a new regulation allowed public access only on sundays and holidays the other days the museum was open only to artists and foreigners except for closure on mondays that changed in when the museum became open to the public all days except mondays it was free until when an entrance fee was introduced except on sundays since its post world war ii reopening in the louvre has been closed on tuesdays and habitually open to the public the rest of the week except for some holidays the use of cameras and video recorders is permitted inside but flash photography is forbidden the louvre palace which houses the museum was begun by king philip ii in the late th century to protect the city from the attack from the west as the kingdom of england still held normandy at the time remnants of the medieval louvre are still visible in the crypt whether this was the first building on that spot is not known and it is possible that philip modified an existing tower the origins of the name louvre are somewhat disputed according to the authoritative grand larousse encyclop dique the name derives from an association with wolf hunting den via latin lupus lower empire lupara in the th century burgundofara also known as saint fare abbess in meaux is said to have gifted part of her villa called luvra situated in the region of paris to a monastery even though it is doubtful that this land corresponded exactly to the present site of the louvre the louvre palace has been subject to numerous renovations since its construction in the th century charles v converted the building from its military role into a residence in francis i started its rebuilding in french renaissance style after louis xiv chose versailles as his residence in construction works slowed to a halt the royal move away from paris resulted in the louvre being used as a residence for artists under royal patronage for example four generations of craftsmen artists from the boulle family were granted royal patronage and resided in the louvre meanwhile the collections of the louvre originated in the acquisitions of paintings and other artworks by the monarchs of the house of france at the palace of fontainebleau francis collected art that would later be part of the louvre s art collections including leonardo da vinci s mona lisa the cabinet du roi consisted of seven rooms west of the galerie d apollon on the upper floor of the remodeled petite galerie many of the king s paintings were placed in these rooms in when it became an art gallery accessible to certain art lovers as a kind of museum in after the court moved to versailles of the paintings were transferred there somewhat diminishing the collection but it is mentioned in paris guide books from on and was shown to ambassadors from siam in by the mid th century there were an increasing number of proposals to create a public gallery in the louvre art critic tienne la font de saint yenne in published a call for a display of the royal collection on october louis xv decided on a display of pieces from the royal collection mounted in the galerie royale de peinture of the luxembourg palace a hall was opened by le normant de tournehem and the marquis de marigny for public viewing of the king s paintings tableaux du roy on wednesdays and saturdays the luxembourg gallery included andrea del sarto s charity and works by raphael titian veronese rembrandt poussin or van dyck it closed in as a result of the royal gift of the luxembourg palace to the count of provence the future king louis xviii by the king in under louis xvi the idea of a royal museum in the louvre came closer to fruition the comte d angiviller broadened the collection and in proposed to convert the grande galerie of the louvre which at that time contained the plans reliefs or d models of key fortified sites in and around france into the french museum many design proposals were offered for the louvre s renovation into a museum without a final decision being made on them hence the museum remained incomplete until the french revolution the louvre finally became a public museum during the french revolution in may the national constituent assembly declared that the louvre would be a place for bringing together monuments of all the sciences and arts on august louis xvi was imprisoned and the royal collection in the louvre became national property because of fear of vandalism or theft on august the national assembly pronounced the museum s preparation as urgent in october a committee to preserve the national memory began assembling the collection for display the museum opened on august the first anniversary of the monarchy s demise as mus um central des arts de la r publique the public was given free accessibility on three days per week which was perceived as a major accomplishment and was generally appreciated the collection showcased paintings and objects of art three quarters were derived from the royal collections the remainder from confiscated migr s and church property biens nationaux to expand and organize the collection the republic dedicated livres per year in france s revolutionary armies began bringing pieces from northern europe augmented after the treaty of tolentino by works from the vatican such as the laoco n and apollo belvedere to establish the louvre as a museum and as a sign of popular sovereignty the early days were hectic privileged artists continued to live in residence and the unlabeled paintings hung frame to frame from floor to ceiling the structure itself closed in may due to structural deficiencies it reopened on july arranged chronologically and with new lighting and columns on august the galerie d apollon was opened with an exhibition of drawings meanwhile the louvre s gallery of antiquity sculpture mus e des antiques with artefacts brought from florence and the vatican had opened in november in anne of austria s former summer apartment located on the ground floor just below the galerie d apollon on november napoleon appointed dominique vivant denon a scholar and polymath who had participated in the egyptian campaign of as the museum s first director in preference to alternative contenders such as antiquarian ennio quirino visconti painter jacques louis david sculptor antonio canova and architects l on dufourny or pierre fontaine on denon s suggestion in july the museum itself was renamed mus e napol on the collection grew through successful military campaigns acquisitions were made of spanish austrian dutch and italian works either as the result of war looting or formalized by treaties such as the treaty of tolentino at the end of napoleon s first italian campaign in the treaty of campo formio was signed with count philipp von cobenzl of the austrian monarchy this treaty marked the completion of napoleon s conquest of italy and the end of the first phase of the french revolutionary wars it compelled italian cities to contribute pieces of art and heritage to napoleon s parades of spoils through paris before being put into the louvre museum the horses of saint mark which had adorned the basilica of san marco in venice after the sack of constantinople in were brought to paris where they were placed atop napoleon s arc de triomphe du carrousel in under the treaty of tolentino the two statues of the nile and tiber were taken to paris from the vatican in and were both kept in the louvre until the nile was later returned to rome whereas the tiber has remained in the louvre to this day the despoilment of italian churches and palaces outraged the italians and their artistic and cultural sensibilities after the french defeat at waterloo the looted works former owners sought their return the louvre s administrator denon was loath to comply in absence of a treaty of restitution in response foreign states sent emissaries to london to seek help and many pieces were returned though far from all in louis xviii finally concluded agreements with the austrian government for the keeping of works such as veronese s wedding at cana which was exchanged for a large le brun or the repurchase of the albani collection for most of the th century from napoleon s time to the second empire the louvre and other national museums were managed under the monarch s civil list and thus depended much on the ruler s personal involvement whereas the most iconic collection remained that of paintings in the grande galerie a number of other initiatives mushroomed in the vast building named as if they were separate museums even though they were generally managed under the same administrative umbrella correspondingly the museum complex was often referred to in the plural les mus es du louvre rather than singular citation needed during the bourbon restoration louis xviii and charles x added to the collections the greek and roman sculpture gallery on the ground floor of the southwestern side of the cour carr e was completed on designs by percier and fontaine in an exhibition of manufactured products was opened in the first floor of the cour carr e s southern wing and would stay there until the mid s charles x in created the mus e gyptien and in included it in his broader mus e charles x a new section of the museum complex located in a suite of lavishly decorated rooms on the first floor of the south wing of the cour carr e the egyptian collection initially curated by jean fran ois champollion formed the basis for what is now the louvre s department of egyptian antiquities it was formed from the purchased collections of edm antoine durand henry salt and the second collection of bernardino drovetti the first one having been purchased by victor emmanuel i of sardinia to form the core of the present museo egizio in turin the restoration period also saw the opening in of the galerie d angoul me a section of largely french sculptures on the ground floor of the northwestern side of the cour carr e many of whose artefacts came from the palace of versailles and from alexandre lenoir s mus e des monuments fran ais following its closure in meanwhile the french navy created an exhibition of ship models in the louvre in december initially named mus e dauphin in honor of dauphin louis antoine building on an th century initiative of henri louis duhamel du monceau this collection renamed mus e naval in and later to develop into the mus e national de la marine was initially located on the first floor of the cour carr e s north wing and in moved up one level to the nd floor attic where it remained for more than a century first room room room salle des colonnes room room room following the july revolution king louis philippe focused his interest on the repurposing of the palace of versailles into a museum of french history conceived as a project of national reconciliation and the louvre was kept in comparative neglect louis philippe did however sponsor the creation of the mus e assyrien to host the monumental assyrian sculpture works brought to paris by paul mile botta in the ground floor gallery north of the eastern entrance of the cour carr e the assyrian museum opened on may separately louis philippe had his spanish gallery displayed in the louvre from january in five rooms on the first floor of the cour carr e s east colonnade wing but the collection remained his personal property as a consequence the works were removed after louis philippe was deposed in and were eventually auctioned away in the short lived second republic had more ambitions for the louvre it initiated repair work the completion of the galerie d apollon and of the salle des sept chemin es and the overhaul of the salon carr former site of the iconic yearly salon and of the grande galerie in the naval museum in the cour carr e s attic was brought under the common louvre museum management a change which was again reversed in in under the leadership of curator adrien de longp rier the mus e mexicain opened within the louvre as the first european museum dedicated to pre columbian art citation needed the rule of napoleon iii was transformational for the louvre both the building and the museum in he created the mus e des souverains in the colonnade wing an ideological project aimed at buttressing his personal legitimacy in he bought artworks including paintings greek gold and other antiquities of the campana collection for its display he created another new section within the louvre named mus e napol on iii occupying a number of rooms in various parts of the building between and the museum added new artefacts to its collections the main change of that period was to the building itself in the s architects louis visconti and hector lefuel created massive new spaces around what is now called the cour napol on some of which in the south wing now aile denon went to the museum in the s lefuel also led the creation of the pavillon des sessions with a new salle des etats closer to napoleon iii s residence in the tuileries palace with the effect of shortening the grande galerie by about a third of its previous length a smaller but significant second empire project was the decoration of the salle des empereurs below the salon carr citation needed entrance to a section of the mus e napol on iii from the salle des s ances then a double height space galerie daru part of the new louvre

during the suppression of the paris commune on may as the french army advanced into paris a force of communards led by jules bergeret fr set fire to the adjoining tuileries palace the fire burned for forty eight hours entirely destroying the interior of the tuileries and spreading to the north west wing of the museum next to it the emperor s louvre library biblioth que du louvre and some of the adjoining halls in what is now the richelieu wing were separately destroyed but the museum was saved by the efforts of paris firemen and museum employees led by curator henry barbet de jouy following the end of the monarchy several spaces in the louvre s south wing went to the museum the salle du man ge was transferred to the museum in and in became its main entrance lobby the large salle des etats that had been created by lefuel between the grande galerie and pavillon denon was redecorated in by edmond guillaume fr lefuel s successor as architect of the louvre and opened as a spacious exhibition room edomond guillaume also decorated the first floor room at the northwest corner of the cour carr e on the ceiling of which he placed in a monumental painting by carolus duran the triumph of marie de medici originally created in for the luxembourg palace meanwhile during the third republic the louvre acquired new artefacts mainly via donations gifts and sharing arrangements on excavations abroad the item collection la caze donated in by louis la caze included works by chardin fragonard rembrandt and watteau in the winged victory of samothrace which had been found in the aegean sea in was prominently displayed as the focal point of the escalier daru major artifacts excavated at susa in iran including the massive apadana capital and glazed brick decoration from the palace of darius there accrued to the oriental near eastern antiquities department in the s the soci t des amis du louvre was established in and donated prominent works such as the piet of villeneuve l s avignon the expansion of the museum and its collections slowed after world war i however despite some prominent acquisitions such as georges de la tour s saint thomas and baron edmond de rothschild s donation of prints drawings and illustrated books from the late th century the louvre gradually veered away from its mid century ambition of universality to become a more focused museum of french western and near eastern art covering a space ranging from iran to the atlantic the collections of the louvre s mus e mexicain were transferred to the mus e d ethnographie du trocad ro in as the mus e de marine was increasingly constrained to display its core naval themed collections in the limited space it had in the second floor attic of the northern half of the cour carr e many of its significant holdings of non western artefacts were transferred in to the trocad ro ethnography museum the national antiquities museum in saint germain en laye and the chinese museum in the palace of

following decade in louvre architects camille lef vre and albert ferran redesigned the escalier daru to its current appearance the cour du sphinx in the south wing was covered by a glass roof in decorative arts exhibits were expanded in the first floor of the north wing of the cour carr e including some of france s first period room displays in the late s the la caze donation was moved to a

louvre conducted an elaborate plan of evacuation of its art collection when germany occupied the sudetenland many important artworks such as the mona lisa were temporarily moved to the ch teau de chambord when war was formally declared a year later most of the museum s paintings were sent there as well select sculptures such as winged victory of samothrace and the venus de milo were sent to the ch teau de valen ay on august after two days of packing truck convoys began to leave paris by december the museum was cleared of most works except those that were too heavy and unimportant paintings that were left in the basement in early after the liberation of france art began returning to the louvre new arrangements after the war revealed the further evolution of taste away from the lavish decorative practices of the late th century in edmond guillaume s ceiling ornaments were removed from the salle des etats where the mona lisa was first displayed in around louvre architect jean

pavillon des sessions and opened in six years ahead of the mus e du quai branly itself the main other initiative in the aftermath of the grand louvre project was chirac s decision to create a new department of islamic art by executive order of august and to move the corresponding collections from their prior underground location in the richelieu wing to a more prominent site in the denon wing that new section opened on september together with collections from the roman era eastern mediterranean with financial support from the al waleed bin talal foundation and on a design by mario bellini

seized under napoleon i as well as during world war ii by the nazis during nazi occupation thousands of artworks were stolen but after the war articles on more than seized artworks returned to france and were assigned to the office des biens priv s in it entrusted unclaimed pieces including paintings to the direction des mus es de france in order to keep them under appropriate conditions of conservation until their restitution and meanwhile classified them as mnrs mus es nationaux recuperation or in english the national museums of recovered artwork some to of the pieces are believed to come from jewish spoliations and until the identification of their rightful owners which declined at the end of the s they are registered indefinitely on separate inventories from the museum s collections they were exhibited in and shown all together to the public during four years in order to allow rightful claimants to identify their properties then stored or displayed according to their

minister alain jupp initiated the matt oli commission headed by jean matt oli to investigate the matter and according to the government the louvre is in charge of pieces of artwork still unclaimed by their rightful owners during the late s the comparison of the american war archives which had not been done before with the french and german ones as well as two court cases which finally settled some of the heirs rights gentili di giuseppe and rosenberg families allowed more accurate investigations since the restitutions according sometimes to less formal criteria concerned more pieces paintings with from the louvre including a then displayed tiepolo until the last claims of french owners and their heirs ended again in citation needed according to serge klarsfeld since the now complete and constant publicity which the artworks got in the majority of the french jewish community is nevertheless in favour of the return to the normal french civil rule of prescription acquisitive of any unclaimed good after another long period of time and consequently to their ultimate integration into the common french heritage instead of their transfer to foreign institutions like during world war ii citation needed napoleon s campaigns acquired italian pieces by treaties as war reparations and northern european pieces as spoils as well as some antiquities excavated in egypt though the vast majority of the latter were seized as war reparations by the british army and are now part of collections of the british museum on the other hand the dendera zodiac is like the rosetta stone claimed by egypt even though it was acquired in before the egyptian anti export legislation of the louvre administration has thus argued in favor of retaining this item despite requests by egypt for its return the museum participates too in arbitration sessions held via unesco s committee for promoting the return of cultural property to its countries of origin the museum consequently returned in five

es de france in over international artists urged a boycott of the new guggenheim museum as well as louvre abu dhabi citing reports since of abuses of foreign construction workers on saadiyat island including the arbitrary withholding of wages unsafe working conditions and failure of companies to pay or reimburse the steep recruitment fees being charged to laborers according to architectural record abu dhabi has comprehensive labor laws to protect the workers but they are not conscientiously implemented or enforced in the guggenheim foundation placed on its website a joint statement with abu dhabi s tourism development and investment company tdic recognizing the following workers rights issues among others health and safety of the workers their access to their passports and other documents that the employers have been retaining to guaranty that they stay on the job using a general contractor that agrees to obey the labor laws maintaining an independent site monitor and ending the system that has been generally used in the persian gulf region of requiring workers to reimburse recruitment fees in the observer reported that conditions for the workers at the louvre and new york university construction sites on saadiyat amounted to modern day slavery in the guggenheim s director richard armstrong said that he believed that living conditions for the workers at the louvre project were now good and that many fewer of them were having their passports confiscated he stated that the main issue then remaining was the recruitment fees charged to workers by agents who recruit them later in the guggenheim s architect gehry commented that working with the abu dhabi officials to implement the law to improve the labor conditions at the museum s site is a moral responsibility he encouraged the tdic to build additional worker housing and proposed that the contractor cover the cost of the recruitment fees in tdic engaged pricewaterhousecoopers as an independent monitor required to issue reports every quarter labor lawyer scott horton told architectural record that he hoped the guggenheim project will influence the treatment of workers on other saadiyat sites and will serve as a model for doing things right

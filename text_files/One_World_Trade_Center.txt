 one world trade center also known as one world trade one wtc and formerly freedom tower note is the main building of the rebuilt world trade center complex in lower manhattan new york city designed by david childs of skidmore owings merrill one world trade center is the tallest building in the united states the tallest building in the western hemisphere and the seventh tallest in the world the supertall structure has the same name as the north tower of the original world trade center which was destroyed in the terrorist attacks of september the new skyscraper stands on the northwest corner of the acre ha world trade center site on the site of the original world trade center it is bounded by west street to the west vesey street to the north fulton street to the south and washington street to the east the construction of below ground utility relocations footings and foundations for the new building began on april one world trade center became the tallest structure in new york city on april when it surpassed the height of the empire state building the tower s steel structure was topped out on august on may the final component of the skyscraper s spire was installed making the building including its spire reach a total height of feet m its height in feet is a deliberate reference to the year when the united states declaration of independence was signed the building opened on november the one world observatory opened on may on march the port authority of new york and new jersey panynj confirmed that the building would be officially known by its legal name of one world trade center rather than its colloquial name of freedom tower the building has stories with the top floor numbered the new world trade center complex will eventually include five high rise office buildings built along greenwich street as well as the national september memorial museum located just south of one world trade center where the original twin towers stood the construction of the new building is part of an effort to memorialize and rebuild following the destruction of the original world trade center complex the construction of the original world trade center was conceived as an urban renewal project and spearheaded by david rockefeller the project was intended to help revitalize lower manhattan the project was planned by the port authority of new york and new jersey which hired architect minoru yamasaki the twin towers at and world trade center were designed as framed tube structures giving tenants open floor plans unobstructed by columns or walls one world trade center was the north tower and two world trade center was the south tower each tower was over feet m high and occupied about acre ha of the total acres ha of the site s land of the stories in each tower were set aside as mechanical floors all the remaining floors were open for tenants each floor of the tower had square feet m of available space the north and south tower had square feet m of total office space construction of the north tower began in august extensive use of prefabricated components sped up the construction process the first tenants moved into the north tower in october at the time the original one world trade center became the tallest building in the world at feet m tall after a foot m tall antenna was installed in the highest point of the north tower reached ft m in the s four other low level buildings were built as part of the world trade center complex a seventh building was built in the mid s the entire complex of seven buildings had a combined total of square feet m of office space at a m edt on september five hijackers affiliated with al qaeda crashed american airlines flight into the northern facade of the north tower between the rd and th floors seventeen minutes later at a m edt a second group of terrorists crashed the hijacked united airlines flight into the southern facade of the south tower striking between the th and th floors by a m edt the south tower collapsed after burning for approximately minutes after burning for minutes the north tower collapsed due to structural failure at a m edt when the north tower collapsed debris fell on the nearby world trade center damaging it and starting fires the fires burned for hours compromising the building s structural integrity seven world trade center collapsed at p m edt together with a simultaneous attack on the pentagon in arlington virginia and a failed plane hijacking that resulted in a plane crash in shanksville pennsylvania the attacks resulted in the deaths of people civilians firefighters law enforcement officers military personnel and the hijackers more than of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact in the north tower people at or above the point of impact were trapped and died of smoke inhalation fell jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames or were killed when the building eventually collapsed one stairwell in the south tower stairwell a somehow avoided complete destruction unlike the rest of the building when flight hit all three staircases in the north tower above the impact zone were destroyed thus making it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape people below the point of impact also died following the destruction of the original world trade center there was debate regarding the future of the world trade center site there were proposals for its reconstruction almost immediately and by the lower manhattan development corporation had organized a competition to determine how to use the site the proposals were part of a larger plan to memorialize the september attacks and rebuild the complex already the site was becoming a tourist attraction in the year following the attacks the ground zero site became the most visited place in the united states on september the viewing wall a temporary display containing information about the attacks and listing the names of the dead opened to the public when the public rejected the first round of designs a second more open competition took place in december in which a design by daniel libeskind was selected as the winner in february other designs were submitted by richard meier peter eisenman charles gwathmey and steven holl william pedersen and foster and partners this design underwent many revisions mainly because of disagreements with developer larry silverstein who held the lease to the world trade center site at that time peter walker and michael arad s reflecting absence proposal was selected as the site s memorial in january there was criticism concerning the limited number of floors that were designated for office space and other amenities in an early plan only floors would have been habitable and the total office space of the rebuilt world trade center complex would have been reduced by more than square feet m in comparison with the original complex the floor limit was imposed by silverstein who expressed concern that higher floors would be a liability in the event of a future terrorist attack or other incident much of the building s height would have consisted of a large open air steel lattice structure on the roof of the tower containing wind turbines and sky gardens in a subsequent design the highest occupiable floor became comparable to the original world trade center and the open air lattice was removed from the plans in former new york governor george pataki faced accusations of cronyism for supposedly using his influence to get the winning architect s design picked as a personal favor for his friend and campaign contributor ronald lauder a final design for the freedom tower was formally unveiled on june to address security issues raised by the new york city police department a foot m concrete base was added to the design in april of that year the design originally included plans to clad the base in glass prisms in order to address criticism that the building might have looked uninviting and resembled a concrete bunker however the prisms were later found to be unworkable as preliminary testing revealed that the prismatic glass easily shattered into large and dangerous shards as a result it was replaced by a simpler facade consisting of stainless steel panels and blast resistant glass contrasting with libeskind s original plan the tower s final design tapers octagonally as it rises its designers stated that the tower would be a monolithic glass structure reflecting the sky and topped by a sculpted antenna in larry silverstein commented on a planned completion date by we should have a completely rebuilt world trade center more magnificent more spectacular than it ever was on april the port authority of new york and new jersey approved a conceptual framework that allowed foundation construction to begin a formal agreement was drafted the following day the th anniversary of the opening of the empire state building construction began in may a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place when the first construction team arrived the symbolic cornerstone of one world trade center was laid in a ceremony on july the stone had an inscription supposedly written by arthur j finkelstein construction was delayed until due to disputes over money security and design the last major issues were resolved on april when a deal was made between developer larry silverstein and the port authority of new york and new jersey so the cornerstone was temporarily removed from the site on june soon after explosives were detonated at the construction site for two months to clear bedrock for the building s foundation onto which cubic yards cubic meters of concrete was poured by november in a december ceremony held in nearby battery park city members of the public were invited to sign the first foot m steel beam installed onto the building s base it was welded onto the building s base on december foundation and steel installation began shortly afterward so the tower s footings and foundation were nearly complete within a year an estimate in february placed the initial construction cost of one world trade center at about billion or per square foot per square meter in january two cranes were moved onto the site construction of the tower s concrete core which began after the cranes arrived reached street level by may the base was not finished until two years later after which construction of the office floors began and the first glass windows were subsequently installed during floors were constructed at a rate of about one per week an advanced cocoon scaffolding system was installed to protect workers from falling and was the first such safety system installed on a steel structure in the city the tower reached floors and was over feet m tall by december the tower s steel frame was halfway complete by then but grew to floors by the tenth anniversary of the september attacks at which time its concrete flooring had reached floors and the glass cladding had reached floors in the port authority changed the official name of the building from freedom tower to one world trade center stating that this name was the easiest for people to identify with the freedom tower name had also been subject to ridicule on programs like saturday night live the name change also served a practical purpose real estate agents believed that it would be easier to lease space in a building with a traditional street address the change came after board members of the port authority voted to sign a year lease deal with vantone industrial co a chinese real estate company which would become the building s first commercial tenant to sign a lease vantone planned to create the china center a trade and cultural facility covering square feet on floors through mass media company cond nast became one wtc s anchor tenant in may leasing million square feet m and relocating from times square while under construction the tower was specially illuminated on several occasions for example it was lit in red white and blue for independence day and the anniversary of the september attacks and it was illuminated in pink for breast cancer awareness month the tower s loading dock could not be finished in time to move equipment into the completed building so five temporary loading bays were added at a cost of millions of dollars the temporary path station was not to be removed until its official replacement the world trade center transportation hub was completed blocking access to the planned loading area chadbourne parke a midtown manhattan based law firm was supposed to lease square feet m in january but the deal was abruptly canceled that march by march one wtc s steel structure had reached stories growing to the th story labeled as floor and feet m by the end of the month the tower s estimated cost had risen to billion by april making it the most expensive building in the world at the time the tower s construction was partly funded by approximately billion of insurance money that silverstein received for his losses in the september attacks the state of new york provided an additional million and the port authority agreed to give billion which would be obtained through the sale of bonds the port authority raised prices for bridge and tunnel tolls to raise funds with a percent toll increase scheduled between and however the proceeds of these increases were not used to pay for the tower s construction the still incomplete tower became new york city s tallest building by roof height in april passing the foot m roof height of the empire state building president barack obama visited the construction site two months later and wrote on a steel beam that would be hoisted to the top of the tower the sentence we remember we rebuild we come back stronger that same month with the tower s structure nearing completion the owners of the building began a public marketing campaign for the building seeking to attract visitors and tenants one world trade center s steel structure topped out at floor with a total height of feet m in august the tower s spire was then shipped from quebec to new york in november following a series of delays the first section of the spire was hoisted to the top of the tower on december and was installed on january by march two sections of the spire had been installed bad weather delayed the delivery of the final pieces on may the final piece of the spire was lifted to the top of one wtc bringing the tower to its full height of feet m and making it the fourth tallest building in the world at the time in subsequent months the exterior elevator shaft was removed the podium glass interior decorations and other finishes were being installed and installation of concrete flooring and steel fittings was completed on november the height committee of the chicago based council on tall buildings and urban habitat ctbuh made the controversial announcement that one world trade center was the tallest building in the united states declaring that the mast on top of the building is a spire since it is a permanent part of the building s architecture by the same reasoning the building was also the tallest in the western hemisphere a report in september revealed that at the time of the report the world trade center association wtca was negotiating with regard to the world trade center name as the wtca had purchased the rights to the name in the wtca sought worth of free office space in the tower in exchange for the use of world trade center in the tower s name and associated souvenirs the original twin towers c one world trade center under construction behind the world financial center in june one world trade center to the left and world trade center under construction as seen from a helicopter on april on november moving trucks started moving items for cond nast the new york times noted that the area around the world trade center had transitioned from a financial area to one with technology firms residences and luxury shops coincident with the building of the new tower the building opened on november and cond nast employees moved into floors cond nast occupied floors to having completed its move in early it was expected that the company would attract new tenants to occupy the remaining of unleased space in the tower as cond nast had revitalized times square after moving there in only about of total employees moved into one wtc on the first day at the time future tenants included kids creative legends hospitality the bmb group servcorp and gq on november shortly after the building opened supporting wire rope cables of a suspended working platform slacked trapping a two man window washing team during the late s the durst organization leased most of the remaining vacant space the tower reached percent occupancy just before the onset of the covid pandemic in new york city in by august cond nast indicated it wanted to leave one world trade center this led advance publications parent company of conde nast to start withholding rent payments in january by march cond nast had filed plans to reduce the amount of office space that it leased after a prolonged impasse cond nast agreed in late to pay almost million in back rent in december the new york liberty development corporation announced that it would refinance wtc with a million bond issue the money from this bond issue would be used to retire the debt from the building s last refinancing in by march the building was percent leased a higher percentage than before the covid pandemic the high occupancy rate of one wtc contrasted with that of the original twin towers which had never reached full occupancy until just before the september attacks many of daniel libeskind s original concepts from the competition were discarded from the tower s final design one world trade center s final design consisted of simple symmetries and a more traditional profile intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary new york skyline the tower s central spire draws from previous buildings such as the empire state building and the chrysler building it also visually resembles the original twin towers rather than being an off center spire similar to the statue of liberty one world trade center is considered the first major building whose construction is based upon a three dimensional building information model just south of the new one world trade center is the national september memorial museum which is located where the original twin towers stood immediately to the east is world trade center transportation hub and the new two world trade center site to the north is world trade center and to the west is brookfield place the building occupies a foot m square with an area of square feet m nearly identical to the footprints of the original twin towers the tower is built upon a foot m tall windowless concrete base designed to protect it from truck bombs and other ground level attacks from the th floor upwards the square edges of the tower s cubic base are chamfered back shaping the building into eight tall isosceles triangles or an elongated square antiprism near its middle the tower forms a perfect octagon and then culminates in a glass parapet whose shape is a square oriented degrees from the base a foot m sculpted mast containing the broadcasting antenna designed in a collaboration between skidmore owings and merrill som artist kenneth snelson who invented the tensegrity structure lighting designers and engineers is secured by a system of cables and rises from a circular support ring which contains additional broadcasting and maintenance equipment at night an intense beam of light is projected vertically from the spire and shines over feet m above the tower david childs of som the architect of one world trade center said the following regarding the tower s design we really wanted our design to be grounded in something that was very real not just in sculptural sketches we explored the infrastructural challenges because the proper solution would have to be compelling not just beautiful the design does have great sculptural implications and we fully understand the iconic importance of the tower but it also has to be a highly efficient building the discourse about freedom tower has often been limited to the symbolic formal and aesthetic aspects but we recognize that if this building doesn t function well if people don t want to work and visit there then we will have failed as architects originally the base was to be covered in decorative prismatic glass but a simpler glass and steel fa ade was adopted when the prisms proved unworkable the current base cladding consists of angled glass fins protruding from stainless steel panels similar to those on world trade center led lights behind the panels illuminate the base at night there are cable net glass facade panels on all elevations of the building designed by schlaich bergermann will be consistent with the other buildings in the complex the facade panels are feet m high and range in width from feet m on the east and west sides feet m on the north side and feet m on the south side the curtain wall was manufactured and assembled by benson industries in portland oregon using glass made in minnesota by viracon one world trade center s top floor is officially designated as floor despite the fact that the tower only contains actual stories the building has usable above ground floors of which are intended for office purposes approximately square feet m the base consists of floors including a foot high m public lobby featuring the foot mural one union of the senses by american artist jos parl the office floors begin at floor and go up to floor there is a sky lobby on floor office floors resume on floor and stop at floor floors and are mechanical floors the tenants have access to below ground parking storage and shopping access to path new york city subway trains and the world financial center is also provided at the world trade center transportation hub fulton street fulton center and chambers street world trade center park place cortlandt street stations the building allows direct access to west street vesey street and fulton street at ground level the building has an approximate underground footprint of square feet m the tower has a three story observation deck located on floors in addition to existing broadcast and antenna facilities its height is feet m making it the highest vantage point in new york city similar to the empire state building visitors to the observation deck and tenants have their own separate entrances one entrance is on the west street side of the building and the other is from within the shopping mall descending down to a below ground security screening area on the observation deck the actual viewing space is on the th floor but there is a food court on the st floor and a space for events for the nd floor to show visitors the city and give them information and stories about new york an interactive tool called city pulse is used by tour ambassadors the admission fee is per person but admission discounts are available for children and seniors and the deck is free for responders and families of victims when it opened the deck was expected to have about million visitors per year tickets went on sale starting on april the manhattan district attorney probed the port authority about the firm to which it awarded a contract to operate the deck it officially opened on may one day ahead of schedule a plan to build a restaurant near the top of the tower similar to the original one world trade center s windows on the world was abandoned as logistically impractical the tower s window washing tracks are located on a square foot area which is designated as floor as a symbolic reference to the floors of the original tower there are three eating venues at the top of the building a caf called one caf a bar and small plates grill one mix and a fine dining restaurant one dining some commentators including those for the new york post and curbed have criticized the food prices the need of a full observatory ticket purchase to enter and their reputations compared to windows on the world the top floor restaurant in the original one world trade center manhattan from the observatory brooklyn bridge manhattan bridge and spruce street world trade center station leonard street from the nd floor like other buildings in the new world trade center complex one world trade center includes sustainable architecture features much of the building s structure and interior is built from recycled materials including gypsum boards and ceiling tiles around percent of the tower s waste products are recycled although the roof area of any tower is limited the building implements a rainwater collection and recycling scheme for its cooling systems the building s purecell phosphoric acid fuel cells generate megawatts mw of power and its waste steam generates electricity the new york power authority selected utc power to provide the tower s fuel cell system which was one of the largest fuel cell installations in the world once completed the tower also makes use of off site hydroelectric and wind power the windows are made of an ultra clear glass which allows maximum sunlight to pass through the interior lighting is equipped with dimmers that automatically dim the lights on sunny days reducing energy costs like all of the new facilities at the world trade center site one world trade center is heated by steam with limited oil or natural gas utilities on site one world trade center received a leadership in energy and environmental design leed gold certification making it one of the most environmentally sustainable skyscrapers in the world along with the protection provided by the reinforced concrete base a number of other safety features were included in the building s design so that it would be prepared for a major accident or terrorist attack like world trade center the building has foot cm thick reinforced concrete walls in all stairwells elevator shafts risers and sprinkler systems there are also extra wide pressurized stairwells along with a dedicated set of stairwells exclusively for the use of firefighters and biological and chemical filters throughout the ventilation system in comparison the original twin towers used a purely steel central core to house utility functions protected only by lightweight drywall panels the building is no longer feet m away from west street as the twin towers were at its closest point west street is feet m away the port authority has stated its structure is designed around a strong redundant steel moment frame consisting of beams and columns connected by a combination of welding and bolting paired with a concrete core shear wall the moment frame lends substantial rigidity and redundancy to the overall building structure while providing column free interior spans for maximum flexibility in addition to safety design new security measures were implemented all vehicles will be screened for radioactive materials and other potentially dangerous objects before they enter the site through the underground road four hundred closed circuit surveillance cameras will be placed in and around the site with live camera feeds being continuously monitored by the nypd a computer system will use video analytic computer software designed to detect potential threats such as unattended bags and retrieve images based on descriptions of terrorists or other criminal suspects new york city and port authority police will patrol the site before the world trade center site was fully completed the plaza was not completely opened to the public as the original world trade center plaza was the initial stage of the opening process began on thursday may when the interim operating period of the national september memorial ended during this period all visitors were required to undergo airport style security screening as part of the interim operating period which was expected to end on december screening did not fully end until the official dedication and opening of the museum on may after which visitors were allowed to use the plaza without needing passes the original design went through significant changes after the durst organization joined the port authority of new york and new jersey as the project s co developer in the foot m tall base corners were originally designed to gently slope upward and have prismatic glass the corners were later squared in addition the base s walls are now covered in hundreds of pairs of foot vertical glass fins set against horizontal bands of eight inch wide stainless steel slats the spire was originally to be enclosed with a protective radome described as a sculptural sheath of interlocking fiberglass panels the radome enclosed spire was then changed to a plain antenna douglas durst the chairman of the durst organization stated that the design change would save million som strongly criticized the change and childs said eliminating this integral part of the building s design and leaving an exposed antenna and equipment is unfortunate we stand ready to work with the port on an alternate design after joining the project in the durst organization had suggested eliminating the radome to reduce costs but the proposal was rejected by the port authority s then executive director christopher o ward ward was replaced by patrick foye in september foye changed the port authority s position and the radome was removed from the plans in douglas durst gave a statement regarding the final decision the antenna is going to be mounted on the building over the summer there s no way to do anything at this point the large triangular plaza on the west side of one world trade center was originally planned to have stainless steel steps descending to west street but the steps were changed to a terrace in the final design the terrace can be accessed through a staircase on vesey street the terrace is paved in granite and has sweetgum trees in addition to a block long planter bench durst also removed a skylight from the plaza s plans the skylight was designed to allow natural light to enter the below ground observation deck lobby the plaza is ft in m higher than the adjacent sidewalk the port authority formally approved all these revisions and the revisions were first reported by the new york post patrick foye the executive director of the port authority said that he thought that the changes were few and minor in a telephone interview a contract negotiated between the port authority and the durst organization states that the durst organization will receive a million fee and a percentage of base building changes that result in net economic benefit to the project the specifics of the signed contract give durst of the savings up to million with further returns going down to and as the savings increase the top floor of one world trade center is feet m above ground level along with a ft in m parapet this is identical to the roof height of the original one world trade center the tower s spire brings it to a pinnacle height of feet m a figure intended to symbolize the year when the united states declaration of independence was signed when the spire is included in the building s height as stated by the council on tall buildings and urban habitat ctbuh one world trade center surpasses the height of taipei foot m is the world s tallest all office building and the seventh tallest skyscraper in the world behind the burj khalifa merdeka shanghai tower abraj al bait ping an finance centre and lotte world tower one world trade center is the second tallest freestanding structure in the western hemisphere as the cn tower in toronto exceeds one world trade center s pinnacle height by approximately ft m the chicago spire with a planned height of feet m was expected to exceed the height of one world trade center but its construction was canceled due to financial difficulties in after design changes for one world trade center s spire were revealed in may there were questions as to whether the foot m tall structure would still qualify as a spire and thus be included in the building s height since the tower s spire is not enclosed in a radome as originally planned it could be classified as a simple antenna which is not included in a building s height according to the ctbuh without the spire one world trade center would be feet m tall making it the seventh tallest building in the united states behind the trump international hotel tower in chicago upon completion the building became the tallest in new york city with the antenna but its roof was surpassed in by park avenue which topped out at feet m high one world trade center s developers had disputed the claim that the spire should be reclassified as an antenna following the redesign with port authority spokesman steve coleman reiterating that one world trade center will be the tallest building in the western hemisphere in the ctbuh announced that it would wait to make its final decision as to whether or not the redesigned spire would count towards the building s height on november the ctbuh announced that one world trade center s spire would count as part of the building s recognized height giving it a final height of feet and making it the tallest building in the western hemisphere in march the tower was scaled by year old weehawken new jersey resident justin casquejo who entered the site through a hole in a fence he was subsequently arrested on trespassing charges he allegedly dressed like a construction worker sneaked in and convinced an elevator operator to lift him to the tower s th floor according to news sources he then used stairways to get to the th floor walked past a sleeping security guard and climbed up a ladder to get to the antenna where he took pictures for two hours the elevator operator was reassigned and the guard was fired it was then revealed that officials had failed to install security cameras in the tower which facilitated casquejo s entry to the site casquejo was sentenced to days of community service as a result the social center of the previous one world trade center included a restaurant on the th floor called windows on the world and the greatest bar on earth these were tourist attractions in their own right and a gathering spot for people who worked in the towers this restaurant also housed one of the most prestigious wine schools in the united states called windows on the world wine school run by wine personality kevin zraly despite numerous assurances that these attractions would be rebuilt the port authority scrapped plans to rebuild them which has outraged some observers the fortified base of the tower has also been a source of controversy some critics including deroy murdock of the national review have said that it is alienating and dull and reflects a sense of fear rather than freedom leading them to dub the building the fear tower nicolai ouroussoff the architecture critic for the new york times calls the tower base a grotesque attempt to disguise its underlying paranoia one world trade center is principally owned by the port authority of new york and new jersey around percent equity of the building was sold to the durst organization a private real estate company in exchange for an investment of at least million the durst organization assisted in supervising the building s construction and manages the building for the port authority having responsibility for leasing property management and tenant installations by september around percent of the building s floor space had been leased but no new leases were signed for three years until may the amount of space leased had gone up to percent by november in the state of new york agreed to a year square feet m lease with an option to extend the lease s term and occupy up to square feet m the general services administration gsa initially agreed to a lease of around square feet m and new york state s office of general services ogs planned to occupy around square feet m however the gsa ceded most of its floor space to the port authority in july and the ogs withdrew from the lease contract in april the port authority announced that it was seeking a bidder to operate the sq ft m observation deck on the tower s nd floor in legends hospitality management agreed to operate the observatory in a year million contract the building s first lease a joint project between the port authority and beijing based vantone industrial was announced on march a sq ft m china center combining business and cultural facilities that would be planned between floors and it is intended to represent chinese business and cultural links to the united states and to serve american companies that wish to conduct business in china vantone industrial s lease is for years and months in april a new interior design for the china center was unveiled featuring a vertical folding garden based on a proposal by the chinese artist zhou wei in september china center agreed to reduce the leased space to a single floor on august cond nast publications signed a tentative agreement to move the headquarters and offices for its magazines into one world trade center occupying up to square feet m of floor space on may cond nast reached a final agreement with the port authority securing a year lease with an estimated value of billion on may cond nast finalized the lease contract obtaining square feet m of office space between floors and square feet m of usable space in the podium and below grade floors cond nast leased square feet m of space on floors to in january in the late s and early s cond nast subleased some of its space to other companies this included ambac financial group in march ennead architects in april and constellation agency and reddit in in august it was announced servcorp signed a year lease for square feet m taking the entire th floor servcorp subsequently subleased all of its space on the th floor as private offices boardrooms and co working space to numerous medium sized businesses such as thinkcode d radio and ch rie l atelier des fleurs larry silverstein of silverstein properties the leaseholder and developer of the complex retains control of the surrounding buildings while the port authority has full control of the tower itself silverstein signed a year lease for the world trade center site in july and remains actively involved in most aspects of the site s redevelopment process before construction of the new tower began silverstein was involved in an insurance dispute regarding the tower the terms of the lease agreement signed in for which silverstein paid million gave silverstein as leaseholder the right and obligation to rebuild the structures if they were destroyed after the september attacks there were a series of disputes between silverstein and insurance companies concerning the insurance policies that covered the original towers this resulted in the construction of one world trade center being delayed after a trial resulted a verdict was given on april the verdict was that ten of the insurers involved in the dispute were subject to the one occurrence interpretation so their liability was limited to the face value of those policies three insurers were added to the second trial group at that time the jury was unable to reach a verdict on one insurer swiss reinsurance but it did so several days later on may finding that this company was also subject to the one occurrence interpretation silverstein appealed the swiss reinsurance decision but the appeal failed on october the second trial resulted in a verdict on december the jury determined that nine insurers were subject to the two occurrences interpretation referring to the fact that two different planes had destroyed the towers during the september attacks they were therefore liable for a maximum of double the face value of those particular policies billion the highest potential payout was billion for buildings and in march silverstein appeared at a rally of construction workers and public officials outside an insurance industry conference he highlighted what he describes as the failures of insurers allianz and royal sun alliance to pay million in claims related to the attacks insurers state that an agreement to split payments between silverstein and the port authority is a cause for concern david childs one of silverstein s favorite architects joined the project after silverstein urged him to do so he developed a design proposal for one world trade center initially collaborating with daniel libeskind in may childs revised the design to address security concerns he is the architect of the tower and is responsible for overseeing its day to day design and development architect daniel libeskind won the invitational competition to develop a plan for the new tower in he gave an initial proposal which he called memory foundations for the design of one world trade center his design included aerial gardens windmills and off center spire libeskind later denied a request to place the tower in a more rentable location next to the path station he instead placed it another block west as it would then line up with and resemble the statue of liberty most of libeskind s original designs were later scrapped and other architects were chosen to design the other wtc buildings note however one element of libeskind s initial plan was included in the final design the tower s symbolic height of feet m daniel r tishman along with his father john tishman builder of the original world trade center led the construction team from tishman realty construction the selected builder for one world trade center douglas and jody durst the co presidents of the durst organization a real estate development company won the right to invest at least million in the project on july in august cond nast a long time durst tenant confirmed a tentative deal to move into one world trade center and finalized the deal on may the contract negotiated between the port authority and the durst organization specifies that the durst organization will receive a million fee and a percentage of base building changes that result in net economic benefit to the project the specifics of the signed contract give durst percent of savings up to million stepping down to and percent as savings increase since durst joined the project significant changes have been made to the building including the foot base of the tower the spire and the plaza to the west of the building facing the hudson river the port authority has approved all the revisions a woodsearch films short subject documentary entitled how does it feel to work on one world trade center was uploaded to youtube on august it depicted construction workers who were satisfied with the working conditions at the construction site however further analysis of the work site showed that dozens of construction related injuries had occurred at the site during the construction of one world trade center including not reported to the u s occupational safety and health administration workers also left post related graffiti at the site which are supposed to symbolize rebirth and resilience

 the palace of westminster serves as the meeting place for both the house of commons and the house of lords the two houses of the parliament of the united kingdom informally known as the houses of parliament the palace lies on the north bank of the river thames in the city of westminster in central london england its name which derives from the neighbouring westminster abbey may refer to several historic structures but most often the old palace a medieval building complex largely destroyed by fire in or its replacement the new palace that stands today the palace is owned by the crown committees appointed by both houses manage the building and report to the speaker of the house of commons and to the lord speaker the first royal palace constructed on the site dated from the th century and westminster became the primary residence of the kings of england until fire destroyed the royal apartments in after which the nearby palace of whitehall was established the remainder of westminster continued to serve as the home of the parliament of england which had met there since the th century and also as the seat of the royal courts of justice based in and around westminster hall in an even greater fire ravaged the heavily rebuilt houses of parliament and the only significant medieval structures to survive were westminster hall the cloisters of st stephen s the chapel of st mary undercroft and the jewel tower in the subsequent competition for the reconstruction of the palace the architect charles barry won with a design for new buildings in the gothic revival style specifically inspired by the english perpendicular gothic style of the th th centuries the remains of the old palace except the detached jewel tower were incorporated into its much larger replacement which contains over rooms organised symmetrically around two series of courtyards and which has a floor area of m sq ft part of the new palace s area of hectares acres was reclaimed from the river thames which is the setting of its nearly metre long ft fa ade called the river front augustus pugin a leading authority on gothic architecture and style assisted barry and designed the interior of the palace construction started in and lasted for years suffering great delays and cost overruns as well as the death of both leading architects works for the interior decoration continued intermittently well into the th century major conservation work has taken place since then to reverse the effects of london s air pollution and extensive repairs followed the second world war including the simplified reconstruction of the commons chamber following its bombing in the palace is one of the centres of political life in the united kingdom westminster has become a metonym for the uk parliament and the british government and the westminster system of government commemorates the name of the palace the elizabeth tower in particular often referred to by the name of its main bell big ben has become an iconic landmark of london and of the united kingdom in general one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city and an emblem of parliamentary democracy tsar nicholas i of russia called the new palace a dream in stone the palace of westminster has been a grade i listed building since and part of a unesco world heritage site since the site of the palace of westminster was strategically important during the middle ages as it was located on the banks of the river thames clarification needed known in medieval times as thorney island the site may have been first used for a royal residence by canute the great during his reign from to st edward the confessor the penultimate anglo saxon monarch of england built a royal palace on thorney island just west of the city of london at about the same time as he built westminster abbey thorney island and the surrounding area soon became known as westminster from the words west and minster neither the buildings used by the anglo saxons nor those used by william i r survive the oldest existing part of the palace westminster hall dates from the reign of william i s successor king william ii r the palace of westminster functioned as the english monarchs principal residence in the late medieval period the predecessors of parliament the witenagemot and the curia regis met in westminster hall although they followed the king when he moved to other palaces simon de montfort s parliament the first to include representatives of the major towns met at the palace in the model parliament the first official parliament of england met there in and almost all subsequent english parliaments and then after all british parliaments have met at the palace in during the early years of the reign of king henry viii fire destroyed the royal residential privy area of the palace in henry viii acquired york place from cardinal thomas wolsey a powerful minister who had lost the king s favour renaming it the palace of whitehall henry used it as his principal residence although westminster officially remained a royal palace it was used by the two houses of parliament and by the various royal law courts being originally a royal residence the palace included no purpose built chambers for the two houses important state ceremonies took place in the painted chamber originally built in the th century as the main bedchamber for king henry iii r in the upper house moved into the larger white chamber also known as the lesser hall which had housed the court of requests the expansion of the peerage by king george iii during the first ministry of william pitt the younger along with the imminent act of union with ireland necessitated the move as the original chamber could not accommodate the increased number of peers the house of commons which did not have a chamber of its own sometimes held its debates in the chapter house of westminster abbey the commons acquired a permanent home at the palace in st stephen s chapel the former chapel of the royal palace during the reign of edward vi r in the building became available for the commons use following the disbanding of st stephen s college alterations were made to st stephen s chapel over the following three centuries for the convenience of the lower house gradually destroying or covering up its original mediaeval appearance a major renovation project undertaken by christopher wren in the late th century completely redesigned the building s interior the palace of westminster as a whole underwent significant alterations from the th century onwards as parliament struggled to carry out its business in the limited available space of ageing buildings calls for an entirely new palace went unheeded instead more buildings of varying quality and style were added a new west fa ade known as the stone building facing onto st margaret s street was designed by john vardy and built in the palladian style between and providing more space for document storage and for committee rooms the house of commons and house of lords engrossing office of henry robert gunnell and edward barwell was on the lower floor beside the corner tower at the west side of vardy s western fa ade it was here where the tax laws for the american colonies were put together a new official residence for the speaker of the house of commons was built adjoining st stephen s chapel and completed in the neo gothic architect james wyatt carried out works both on the house of lords and on the house of commons between and including alterations to the exterior of st stephen s chapel and a much derided new neo gothic building referred to by wyatt s critics as the cotton mill adjoining the house of lords and facing onto old palace yard sir john soane substantially remodelled the palace complex between and the medieval house of lords chamber which had been the target of the failed gunpowder plot of was demolished as part of this work in order to build a new royal gallery and a ceremonial entrance at the southern end of the palace soane s work at the palace also included new library facilities for both houses of parliament and new law courts for the chancery and king s bench soane s alterations caused controversy owing to his use of neo classical architectural styles seen as conflicting with the gothic style of the original buildings on october a fire broke out in the palace after an overheated stove used to destroy the exchequer s stockpile of tally sticks set fire to the house of lords chamber in the resulting conflagration both houses of parliament were destroyed along with most of the other buildings in the palace complex westminster hall was saved thanks to fire fighting efforts and a change in the direction of the wind the jewel tower the undercroft chapel and the cloisters and chapter house of st stephen s were the only other parts of the palace to survive immediately after the fire king william iv offered the almost completed buckingham palace to parliament hoping to dispose of a residence he disliked the building was considered unsuitable for parliamentary use however and the gift was rejected proposals to move to charing cross or st james s park had a similar fate the allure of tradition and the historical and political associations of westminster proved too strong for relocation despite the deficiencies of that site in the meantime the immediate priority was to provide accommodation for the next parliament and so the painted chamber and white chamber were hastily repaired for temporary use in following that year s general election the king permitted parliament to make plans for its permanent accommodation each house created a committee and a public debate over the proposed styles ensued the lords chamber was completed in and the commons chamber in at which point architect charles barry received a knighthood although most of the work had been carried out by construction was not finished until a decade afterwards during the second world war see the blitz the palace of westminster was hit by bombs on fourteen separate occasions one bomb fell into old palace yard on september and severely damaged the south wall of st stephen s porch and the west front the statue of richard the lionheart was lifted from its pedestal by the force of the blast and its upheld sword bent an image that was used as a symbol of the strength of democracy which would bend but not break under attack the worst raid took place in the night of may when the palace took at least twelve hits and three people two policemen and resident superintendent of the house of lords edward elliott were killed an incendiary bomb hit the chamber of the house of commons and set it on fire another set the roof of westminster hall alight the firefighters could not save both and a decision was taken to try to rescue the hall in this they were successful the abandoned commons chamber on the other hand was destroyed as was the members lobby a bomb also struck the lords chamber but went through the floor without exploding the clock tower took a hit by a small bomb or anti aircraft shell at the eaves of the roof suffering much damage there all the glass on the south dial was blown out but the hands and bells were not affected and the great clock continued to keep time accurately following the destruction of the commons chamber the lords offered their own debating chamber for the use of the commons for their own sittings the queen s robing room was converted into a makeshift chamber the commons chamber was rebuilt after the war under the architect sir giles gilbert scott in a simplified version of the old chamber s style the work was undertaken by john mowlem co and construction lasted until the lords chamber was then renovated over the ensuing months the lords re occupied it in may as the need for office space in the palace increased parliament acquired office space in the nearby norman shaw building in and in the custom built portcullis house completed in this increase has enabled all members of parliament mp to have their own office facilities the palace of westminster which is a grade listed building is in urgent need of extensive restoration to its fabric a pre feasibility report set out several options including the possibility of parliament moving to other premises while work is carried out at the same time the option of moving parliament to a new location was discounted with staying at the westminster site preferred an independent options appraisal report released in june found that the cost to restore the palace of westminster could be as much as billion if mps were to remain at the palace whilst works take place mps decided in to vacate the building for six years starting in in january the house of commons voted for both houses to vacate the palace of westminster to allow for a complete refurbishment of the building which may take up to six years starting in it is expected that the house of commons will be temporarily housed in a replica chamber to be located in richmond house in whitehall and the house of lords will be housed at the queen elizabeth ii conference centre in parliament square in september the formation of a new joint committee of the house of lords and the house of commons was announced to oversee the necessary works called the restoration and renewal client board its parliamentarian members are they are joined by lay members sir charles barry s collaborative design for the palace of westminster uses the perpendicular gothic style which was popular during the th century and returned during the gothic revival of the th century barry was a classical architect but he was aided by the gothic architect augustus pugin westminster hall which was built in the th century and survived the fire of was incorporated in barry s design pugin was displeased with the result of the work especially with the symmetrical layout designed by barry he famously remarked all grecian sir tudor details on a classic body in charles barry toured britain looking at quarries and buildings with a committee which included two leading geologists and a stonecarver they selected anston a sand coloured magnesian limestone quarried in the villages of anston south yorkshire and mansfield woodhouse nottinghamshire two quarries were chosen from a list of with the majority of the stone coming from the former a crucial consideration was transportation achieved on water via the chesterfield canal the north sea and the rivers trent and thames furthermore anston was cheaper and could be supplied in blocks up to four feet thick and lent itself to elaborate carving barry s new palace of westminster was rebuilt using the sandy coloured anston limestone however the stone soon began to decay due to pollution and the poor quality of some of the stone used although such defects were clear as early as nothing was done for the remainder of the th century even after much studying during the s however it became clear that some of the stonework had to be replaced in it was deemed necessary to use clipsham stone a honey coloured limestone from rutland to replace the decayed anston the project began in the s but was halted by the outbreak of the second world war and completed only during the s by the s pollution had again begun to take its toll a stone conservation and restoration programme to the external elevations and towers began in and ended in the palace of westminster has three main towers of these the largest and tallest is the metre ft victoria tower which occupies the south western corner of the palace originally named the king s tower because the fire of which destroyed the old palace of westminster occurred during the reign of king william iv the tower was an integral part of barry s original design of which he intended it to be the most memorable element the architect conceived the great square tower as the keep of a legislative castle echoing his selection of the portcullis as his identifying mark in the planning competition and used it as the royal entrance to the palace and as a fireproof repository for the archives of parliament the victoria tower was re designed several times and its height increased progressively upon its completion in it was the tallest secular building in the world at the base of the tower is the sovereign s entrance used by the monarch whenever entering the palace to open parliament or for other state occasions the m ft high archway is richly decorated with sculptures including statues of saints george andrew and patrick as well as of queen victoria herself the main body of the victoria tower houses the three million documents of the parliamentary archives in kilometres mi of steel shelves spread over floors these include the master copies of all acts of parliament since and important manuscripts such as the original bill of rights and the death warrant of king charles i at the top of the cast iron pyramidal roof is a m ft flagstaff from which flies the royal standard the monarch s personal flag when the sovereign is present in the palace on all other days the union flag flies from the mast at the north end of the palace rises the most famous of the towers the elizabeth tower commonly known as big ben at metres ft it is only slightly shorter than the victoria tower but much slimmer originally known simply as the clock tower the name elizabeth tower was conferred on it in to celebrate the diamond jubilee of elizabeth ii it houses the great clock of westminster built by edward john dent on designs by amateur horologist edmund beckett denison striking the hour to within a second of the time the great clock achieved standards of accuracy considered impossible by th century clockmakers and it has remained consistently reliable since it entered service in the time is shown on four dials metres ft in diameter which are made of milk glass and are lit from behind at night the hour hand is metres ft in long and the minute hand metres ft the clock tower was designed by augustus pugin and built after his death charles barry asked pugin to design the clock tower because pugin had previously helped barry design the palace in a bbc four documentary richard taylor gives a description of pugin s clock tower it rises up from the ground in this stately rhythm higher and higher before you reach the clock face picked out as a giant rose its petals fringed with gold there s some medieval windows above that and then you hits the grey cast iron roof note its greyness relieved by these delicate little windows again picked out in gold leaf and then it rises up again in this great jet of gold to the higher roof that curves gracefully upwards to a spire with a crown and flowers and a cross it s elegant it s grand it s pretty and has this fairy tale quality and it makes you proud to be british five bells hang in the belfry above the clock the four quarter bells strike the westminster chimes every quarter hour the largest bell strikes the hours officially called the great bell of westminster it is generally referred to as big ben a nickname of uncertain origins which over time has been colloquially applied to the whole tower the first bell to bear this name cracked during testing and was recast the present bell later developed a crack of its own which gives it a distinctive sound it is the third heaviest bell in britain weighing tonnes in the lantern at the top of elizabeth tower is the ayrton light which is lit when either house of parliament is sitting after dark it was installed in at the request of queen victoria so that she could see from buckingham palace whether the members were at work and named after acton smee ayrton who was first commissioner of works in the s the shortest of the palace s three principal towers at metres ft the octagonal central tower stands over the middle of the building immediately above the central lobby it was added to the plans on the insistence of dr david boswell reid who was in charge of the ventilation of the new houses of parliament his plan called for a great central chimney through which what he called vitiated air would be drawn out of the building with the heat and smoke of about four hundred fires around the palace to accommodate the tower barry was forced to lower the lofty ceiling he had planned for the central lobby and reduce the height of its windows however the tower itself proved to be an opportunity to improve the palace s exterior design and barry chose for it the form of a spire in order to balance the effect of the more massive lateral towers in the end the central tower failed completely to fulfill its stated purpose but it is notable as the first occasion when mechanical services had a real influence on architectural design apart from the pinnacles which rise from between the window bays along the fronts of the palace numerous turrets enliven the building s skyline like the central tower these have been added for practical reasons and mask ventilation shafts there are some other features of the palace of westminster which are also known as towers st stephen s tower is positioned in the middle of the west front of the palace between westminster hall and old palace yard and houses the public entrance to the houses of parliament known as st stephen s entrance the pavilions at the northern and southern ends of the river front are called speaker s tower and chancellor s tower respectively after the presiding officers of the two houses at the time of the palace s reconstruction the speaker of the house of commons and the lord chancellor speaker s tower contains speaker s house the official residence of the speaker of the commons there are a number of small gardens surrounding the palace of westminster victoria tower gardens is open as a public park along the side of the river south of the palace black rod s garden named after the office of gentleman usher of the black rod is closed to the public and is used as a private entrance old palace yard in front of the palace is paved over and covered in concrete security blocks see security below cromwell green also on the frontage and in enclosed by hoardings for the construction of a new visitor centre new palace yard on the north side and speaker s green directly north of the palace are all private and closed to the public college green opposite the house of lords is a small triangular green commonly used for television interviews with politicians the palace of westminster contains over rooms staircases and kilometres mi of passageways which are spread over four floors the ground floor is occupied by offices dining rooms and bars the first floor known as the principal floor houses the main rooms of the palace including the debating chambers the lobbies and the libraries the top two floors are used as committee rooms and offices some of the interiors were designed and painted by j g crace working in collaboration with pugin and others for example crace decorated and gilded the ceiling of the chapel of st mary undercroft instead of one main entrance the palace features separate entrances for the different user groups of the building the sovereign s entrance at the base of the victoria tower is located in the south west corner of the palace and is the starting point of the royal procession route the suite of ceremonial rooms used by the monarch at state openings of parliament this consists of the royal staircase the norman porch the robing room the royal gallery and the prince s chamber and culminates in the lords chamber where the ceremony takes place members of the house of lords use the peers entrance in the middle of the old palace yard front which is covered by a stone carriage porch and opens to an entrance hall a staircase from there leads through a corridor to the prince s chamber members of parliament enter their part of the building from the members entrance in the south side of new palace yard their route passes through a cloakroom in the lower level of the cloisters and eventually reaches the members lobby directly south of the commons chamber from new palace yard access can also be gained to the speaker s court and the main entrance of the speaker s house located in the pavilion at the north east corner of the palace st stephen s entrance roughly in the middle of the building s western front is the entrance for members of the public from there visitors walk through a flight of stairs to st stephen s hall location of a collection of marbles which includes somers mansfield hampden walpole pitt and fox traversal of this hallway brings them to the octagonal central lobby the hub of the palace this hall is flanked by symmetrical corridors decorated with fresco paintings which lead to the ante rooms and debating chambers of the two houses the members lobby and commons chamber to the north and the peers lobby and lords chamber to the south another mural lined corridor leads east to the lower waiting hall and the staircase to the first floor where the river front is occupied by a row of committee rooms directly below them the libraries of the two houses overlook the thames from the principal floor the grandest entrance to the palace of westminster is the sovereign s entrance beneath the victoria tower it was designed for the use of the monarch who travels from buckingham palace by carriage every year for the state opening of parliament the imperial state crown which is worn by the sovereign for the ceremony as well as the cap of maintenance and the sword of state which are symbols of royal authority and are borne before the monarch during the procession also travel to the palace by coach accompanied by members of the royal household the regalia as they are collectively known arrive some time before the monarch and are exhibited in the royal gallery until they are needed the sovereign s entrance is also the formal entrance used by visiting dignitaries as well as the starting point of public tours of the palace from there the royal staircase leads up to the principal floor with a broad unbroken flight of steps made of grey granite the staircase is followed by the norman porch a square landing distinguished by its central clustered column and the intricate ceiling it supports which is made up of four groin vaults with lierne ribs and carved bosses the porch was named for its proposed decorative scheme based on norman history in the event neither the planned statues of norman kings nor the frescoes were executed and only the stained glass window portraying edward the confessor hints at this theme queen victoria is depicted twice in the room as a young woman in the other stained glass window and near the end of her life sitting on the throne of the house of lords in a copy of a painting by jean joseph benjamin constant which hangs on the eastern wall the sixteen plinths intended for the statues now house busts of prime ministers who have sat in the house of lords such as the earl grey and the marquess of salisbury a double door opposite the stairs leads to the royal gallery and another to the right opens to the robing room the king s robing room usually referred to simply as the robing room lies at the southern end of the ceremonial axis of the palace and occupies the centre of the building s south front overlooking the victoria tower gardens as its name indicates it is where the sovereign prepares for the state opening of parliament by donning official robes and wearing the imperial state crown the focus of this richly decorated room is the chair of state it sits on a dais of three steps under a canopy adorned with the arms and floral emblems of england scotland and ireland a panel of purple velvet forms the backdrop to the chair embroidered by the royal school of needlework with the royal arms surrounded by stars and vr monograms edward barry designed both the chair the cushion and back of which are also embroidered and the ornate marble fireplace across the room which features gilded statuettes of saint george and saint michael the decorative theme of the room is the legend of king arthur considered by many victorians the source of their nationhood five frescos painted by william dyce between and cover the walls depicting allegorical scenes from the legend each scene represents a chivalric virtue the largest between the two doors is titled admission of sir tristram to the round table and illustrates the virtue of hospitality seven were originally commissioned but the remaining two paintings were not carried out due to the artist s death and on the wallpapered panels flanking the chair of state hang oil portraits of queen victoria and prince albert by franz xaver winterhalter note other decorations in the room are also inspired by the arthurian legend namely a series of bas reliefs beneath the paintings carved in oak by henry hugh armstead and the frieze running below the ceiling which displays the attributed coats of arms of the knights of the round table the ceiling itself is decorated with heraldic badges as is the border of the wooden floor which as can be seen in the adjacent image is left exposed by the carpeting the robing room was also briefly used as the house of lords meeting chamber while the house of lords chamber was occupied by the house of commons whose chamber had been destroyed by the blitz in immediately north of the robing room is the royal gallery at by metres by ft it is one of the largest rooms in the palace its main purpose is to serve as the stage of the royal procession at state openings of parliament which the audience watch from temporary tiered seating on both sides of the route it has also been used on occasion by visiting statesmen from abroad when addressing both houses of parliament as well as for receptions in honour of foreign dignitaries and more regularly for the lord chancellor s breakfast in the past it was the theatre of several trials of peers by the house of lords documents from the parliamentary archives are on display in the royal gallery including a facsimile of charles i s death warrant and the tables and seating offer a workspace for members of the lords that is conveniently close to their debating chamber the decorative scheme of the royal gallery was meant to display important moments in british military history and the walls are decorated by two large paintings by daniel maclise each measuring by metres by ft the death of nelson depicting lord nelson s demise at the battle of trafalgar in and the meeting of wellington and bl cher after the battle of waterloo showing the duke of wellington meeting gebhard leberecht von bl cher at the battle of waterloo in the murals deteriorated rapidly after their completion due to a range of factors most importantly atmospheric pollution and today they are almost monochrome although a finished study of the death of nelson in better condition hangs in the walker art gallery liverpool the rest of the planned frescos were cancelled and the walls are filled with portraits of kings and queens from george i onwards another decorative element with military undertones are the eight statues of gilded caen stone that flank the three doorways and the bay window of the gallery sculpted by john birnie philip each depicts a monarch during whose reign a key battle or war took place they are alfred the great and william the conqueror richard i and edward iii henry v and elizabeth i william iii and anne the panelled ceiling metres ft above the floor features tudor roses and lions and the stained glass windows show the coats of arms of the kings of england and scotland the prince s chamber is a small anteroom between the royal gallery and the lords chamber named after the room adjoining the parliament chamber in the old palace of westminster thanks to its location it is a place where members of the lords meet to discuss business of the house several doors lead out of the room to the division lobbies of the house of lords and to a number of important offices the theme of the prince s chamber is tudor history and oil portraits painted on panels around the room depict members of the tudor dynasty they are the work of richard burchett and his pupils and their creation entailed extensive research which contributed to the founding of the national portrait gallery in bronze bas reliefs are set into the wall below the portraits executed by william theed in scenes included are the field of the cloth of gold the escape of mary queen of scots and raleigh spreading his cloak as a carpet for the queen above the portraits at window level there are compartments intended for copies of six of the ten armada tapestries which hung in the chamber of the house of lords until their destruction in the fire and depicted the defeat of the spanish armada in the project was put on hold in by which time only one painting had been completed and was not revived until as of august update all six paintings have been finished and are on display in the royal gallery they are scheduled to be fixed in the prince s chamber in the following months needs update the room also contains a statue of queen victoria seated on a throne itself placed on a pedestal and holding a sceptre and a laurel crown which show that she both governs and rules this figure is flanked by allegorical statues of justice and clemency the former with a bare sword and an inflexible expression and the latter showing sympathy and offering an olive branch the sculptural ensemble made of white marble and carved by john gibson in reaches metres ft in height its size has long been considered out of proportion with the fittings of the prince s chamber and the flanking statues ended up in storage between and however the size and location of the group in the archway opposite the doors to the royal gallery which are removed before state openings of parliament to facilitate the royal procession indicate that it was meant to be seen from a distance and to symbolically remind the monarch of their royal duties as they would walk down the royal gallery on their way to deliver their speech the chamber of the house of lords is located in the southern part of the palace of westminster the lavishly decorated room measures by metres by ft the benches in the chamber as well as other furnishings in the lords side of the palace are coloured red the upper part of the chamber is decorated by stained glass windows and by six allegorical frescoes representing religion chivalry and law at the south end of the chamber are the ornate gold canopy and throne although the sovereign may theoretically occupy the throne during any sitting he or she attends only the state opening of parliament other members of the royal family who attend the state opening use chairs of state next to the throne and peers sons are always entitled to sit on the steps of the throne in front of the throne is the woolsack an armless red cushion stuffed with wool representing the historical importance of the wool trade and used by the officer presiding over the house the lord speaker since but historically the lord chancellor or a deputy the house s mace which represents royal authority is placed on the back of the woolsack in front of the woolsack is the judges woolsack a larger red cushion that used to be occupied during the state opening by the law lords who were members of the house of lords and prospectively by the supreme court justices and other judges whether or not members to represent the judicial branch of government the table of the house at which the clerks sit is in front members of the house occupy red benches on three sides of the chamber the benches on the lord speaker s right form the spiritual side and those to his left form the temporal side the lords spiritual archbishops and bishops of the established church of england all occupy the spiritual side the lords temporal nobles sit according to party affiliation members of the government party sit on the spiritual side while those of the opposition sit on the temporal side some peers who have no party affiliation sit on the benches in the middle of the house opposite the woolsack they are accordingly known as crossbenchers the lords chamber is the site of nationally televised ceremonies the most important of which is the state opening of parliament which is held formally to open each annual parliamentary session either after a general election or in the autumn at this occasion every constitutional element of the government is represented the crown both literally and figuratively in the person of the sovereign the lords spiritual and temporal and the commons who together form the legislature the judiciary although no judges are members of either house of parliament and the executive both government ministers and ceremonial military units in attendance on the sovereign and a large number of guests are invited to attend in the large royal gallery immediately outside the chamber the sovereign seated on the throne delivers the speech from the throne outlining the government s programme for the year and legislative agenda for the forthcoming parliamentary session the commons may not enter the lords debating floor instead they watch the proceedings from beyond the bar of the house just inside the door a small purely formal ceremony is held to end each parliamentary session when the sovereign is merely represented by a group of lords commissioners following the blitz which destroyed the chamber of the house of commons the lords chamber was occupied by the commons the lords temporarily used the robing room during the reconstruction the state opening of parliament was carried out as normal with the new rooms being used evidence can still be seen of this today with damage clearly visible on one of the doors where they were struck by black rod directly north of the lords chamber lies the peers lobby an antechamber where lords can informally discuss or negotiate matters during sittings of the house as well as collect messages from the doorkeepers who control access to the chamber the lobby is a square room measuring metres ft on each side and metres ft in height and one of its main features is the floor centrepiece a radiant tudor rose made of derbyshire marbles and set within an octagon of engraved brass plates the rest of the floor is paved with encaustic tiles featuring heraldic designs and latin mottoes the walls are faced with white stone and each is pierced by a doorway above the arches are displayed arms representing the six royal dynasties which ruled england until queen victoria s reign saxon norman plantagenet tudor stuart and hanoverian and between them there are windows stained with the arms of the early aristocratic families of england of the doorways the one to the south which leads into the lords chamber is the most magnificent and sports much gilding and decoration including the full royal arms it is enclosed by the brass gates a pair of elaborately pierced and studded doors together weighing tonnes the side doors which feature clocks open into corridors to the east extends the law lords corridor which leads to the libraries and nearby to the west lies the moses room used for grand committees to the north is the vaulted peers corridor which is decorated with eight murals by charles west cope depicting historical scenes from the period around the english civil war the frescoes were executed between and and each scene was specifically chosen to depict the struggles through which national liberties were won examples include speaker lenthall asserting the privileges of the commons against charles i when the attempt was made to seize the five members representing resistance against absolute rule and the embarkation of the pilgrim fathers for new england which illustrates the principle of freedom of worship originally named octagon hall because of its shape the central lobby is the heart of the palace of westminster it lies directly below the central tower and forms a busy crossroads between the house of lords to the south the house of commons to the north st stephen s hall and the public entrance to the west and the lower waiting hall and the libraries to the east its location halfway between the two debating chambers has led constitutional theorist erskine may to describe the lobby as the political centre of the british empire and allows a person standing under the great chandelier to see both the royal throne and the speaker s chair provided that all the intervening doors are open constituents may meet their members of parliament here even without an appointment and this practice is the origin of the term lobbying the hall is also the theatre of the speaker s procession which passes from here on its way to the commons chamber before every sitting of the house the central lobby measures metres ft across and metres ft from the floor to the centre of the vaulted ceiling the panels between the vault s ribs are covered with venetian glass mosaic displaying floral emblems and heraldic badges and the bosses in the intersections of the ribs are also carved into heraldic symbols each wall of the lobby is contained in an arch ornamented with statues of english and scottish monarchs on four sides there are doorways and the tympana above them are adorned with mosaics representing the patron saints of the united kingdom s constituent nations saint george for england saint andrew for scotland saint david for wales and saint patrick for ireland note the other four arches are occupied by high windows under which there are stone screens the hall s post office one of two in the palace is located behind one of these screens in front of them stand four bigger than life statues of th century statesmen including one of four time prime minister william gladstone the floor on which they stand is tiled with minton encaustic tiles in intricate patterns and includes a passage from psalm written in latin which translates as follows except the lord build the house their labour is but lost that build it the east corridor leads from the central lobby to the lower waiting hall and its six panels remained blank until when they were filled with scenes from tudor history they were all paid for by liberal peers and each was the work of a different artist but uniformity was achieved between the frescoes thanks to a common colour palette of red black and gold and a uniform height for the depicted characters one of the scenes is probably not historical plucking the red and white roses in the old temple gardens depicting the origin of these flowers as emblems of the houses of lancaster and york respectively was taken from shakespeare s play henry vi part continuing north from the central lobby is the commons corridor it is of almost identical design to its southern counterpart and is decorated with scenes of th century political history between the civil war and the revolution of they were painted by edward matthew ward and include subjects like monk declaring for a free parliament and the lords and commons presenting the crown to william iii and mary ii in the banqueting hall then mirroring the arrangement at the lords part of the palace is another antechamber the members lobby in this room members of parliament hold discussions or negotiations and are often interviewed by accredited journalists collectively known as the lobby the room is similar to the peers lobby but plainer in design and slightly larger forming a cube metres ft on all sides after the heavy damage it sustained in the bombing it was rebuilt in a simplified style something most evident in the floor which is almost completely unadorned the archway of the door leading into the commons chamber has been left unrepaired as a reminder of the evils of war and is now known as the rubble arch or churchill arch it is flanked by bronze statues of winston churchill and david lloyd george the prime ministers who led britain through the second and first world war respectively a foot of each is conspicuously shiny a result of a long tradition of mps rubbing them for good luck on their way in before their maiden speech the lobby contains the busts and statues of most th century prime ministers as well as two large boards where mps can receive letters and telephone messages designed for the use of the house and installed in the early s the chamber of the house of commons is at the northern end of the palace of westminster it was opened in after the victorian chamber had been destroyed in and re built under the architect giles gilbert scott the chamber measures by metres by ft and is plainer in style than the lords chamber the benches as well as other furnishings in the commons side of the palace are coloured green members of the public are forbidden to sit on the benches other parliaments in commonwealth nations including those of india canada australia and new zealand have copied the colour scheme under which the lower house is associated with green and the upper house with red at the north end of the chamber is the speaker s chair a present to parliament from the commonwealth of australia the current british speaker s chair is an exact copy of the speaker s chair given to australia by the house of commons to celebrate the opening of old parliament house canberra in front of the speaker s chair is the table of the house at which the clerks sit and on which is placed the commons ceremonial mace the table was a gift from canada the dispatch boxes which front bench members of parliament mps often lean on or rest notes on during questions and speeches are a gift from new zealand there are green benches on either side of the house members of the government party occupy benches on the speaker s right while those of the opposition occupy benches on the speaker s left there are no cross benches as in the house of lords the chamber is relatively small and can accommodate only of the members of parliament during prime minister s questions and in major debates mps stand at either end of the house by tradition the british sovereign does not enter the chamber of the house of commons the last monarch to do so was king charles i in the king sought to arrest five members of parliament on charges of high treason but when he asked the speaker william lenthall if he had any knowledge of the whereabouts of these individuals lenthall famously replied may it please your majesty i have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the house is pleased to direct me whose servant i am here since then in the state opening of parliament when black rod representing the monarch approaches the doors to the chamber of the house of commons to make the summons the doors are pointedly slammed in his or her face black rod has to strike the door three times with a staff to be admitted and issue the summons from the monarch to the mps to attend when repairs after the world war ii bombing were completed the rebuilt chamber was opened by king george vi on october who was invited to an unofficial tour of the new structure by commons leaders the two red lines on the floor of the house of commons are metres ft in apart which by apocryphal tradition is intended to be just over two sword lengths it is said that the original purpose of this was to prevent disputes in the house from degenerating into duels however there is no record of a time when members of parliament were allowed to bring swords into the chamber historically only the serjeant at arms has been allowed to carry a sword as a symbol of their role in parliament plus black rod when summoning the commons to the lords and there are loops of pink ribbon in the members cloakroom for mps to hang up their swords before entering the chamber in the days when gentlemen carried swords there were no lines in the chamber protocol dictates that mps may not cross these lines when speaking a member of parliament who violates this convention will be lambasted by opposition members westminster hall the oldest existing part of the palace of westminster was erected in by king william ii william rufus at which point it was the largest hall in europe the roof was probably originally supported by pillars giving three aisles but during the reign of king richard ii this was replaced by a hammerbeam roof by the royal carpenter hugh herland the greatest creation of medieval timber architecture which allowed the original three aisles to be replaced with a single huge open space with a dais at the end the new roof was commissioned in richard s master builder henry yevele retained the original dimensions refacing the walls with fifteen life size statues of kings placed in niches the rebuilding had been begun by king henry iii in but by richard s time had been dormant for over a century in westminster hall the favourite heraldic badge of richard ii a white hart chained and in an attitude of rest is repeated eighty three times without any of them being an exact copy of another the largest clearspan medieval roof in england westminster hall s roof measures by metres by ft oak timbers for the roof came from royal woods in hampshire and from parks in hertfordshire and from that of william crozier of stoke d abernon who supplied over oaks in surrey among other sources they were assembled near farnham surrey kilometres mi away accounts record the large number of wagons and barges which delivered the jointed timbers to westminster for assembly westminster hall has served numerous functions until the th century it was regularly used for judicial purposes housing three of the most important courts in the land the court of king s bench the court of common pleas and the court of chancery in the reign of henry ii a royal decree established a fixed sitting of judges in the hall in magna carta stipulated that these courts would sit regularly in the hall for the convenience of litigants in the courts were amalgamated into the high court of justice which continued to have chambers adjacent to westminster hall until moved to the then new royal courts of justice building in in addition to regular courts westminster hall also housed important state trials including impeachment trials and the state trials of king charles i at the end of the english civil war william wallace thomas more cardinal john fisher guy fawkes the earl of strafford the rebel scottish lords of the and uprisings and warren hastings the st stephen s porch end of the hall displays under the stained glass window the parliamentary war memorial listing on eight panels the names of members and staff of both houses of parliament and their sons killed serving in the first world war the window itself installed in commemorates members and staff of both houses who died in the second world war in a new stained glass window commemorating queen elizabeth ii s diamond jubilee was installed opposite this window at the other end of the hall westminster hall has also served ceremonial functions from the twelfth century to the nineteenth coronation banquets honouring new monarchs were held here the last coronation banquet was that of king george iv held in his successor william iv abandoned the idea because he deemed it too expensive the hall has been used as a place for lying in state during state and ceremonial funerals such an honour is usually reserved for the sovereign and for their consorts the only non royals to receive it in the twentieth century were frederick sleigh roberts st earl roberts the victims of the crash of the airship r and winston churchill in the hall was used for the lying in state of queen elizabeth the queen mother and in the hall was used for the lying in state of queen elizabeth ii around mourners filed past the coffin which resulted in the delamination of the yorkstone floor the two houses have presented ceremonial addresses to the crown in westminster hall on important public occasions for example addresses were presented at elizabeth ii s silver jubilee golden jubilee and diamond jubilee the accession of charles iii the th anniversary of the glorious revolution and the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the second world war it is considered a rare privilege for a foreign leader to be invited to address both houses of parliament in westminster hall since the second world war the only leaders to have done so have been french president charles de gaulle in south african president nelson mandela in pope benedict xvi in u s president barack obama in and burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi in president obama was the first us president to be invited to use the hall for an address to parliament and aung san suu kyi was the first non head of state to be given the accolade of addressing mps and peers in westminster hall following reforms in the house of commons now uses the grand committee room next to westminster hall as an additional debating chamber although it is not part of the main hall these are usually spoken of as westminster hall debates in contrast with the two main chambers in which the government and opposition benches directly face each other the seating in the grand committee room is laid out in a u shape a pattern meant to reflect the non partisan nature of the debates there there are two suites of libraries on the principal floor overlooking the river for the house of lords library and house of commons library the palace of westminster also includes state apartments for the presiding officers of the two houses the official residence of the speaker stands at the northern end of the palace the lord chancellor s apartments are at the southern end each day the speaker and lord speaker take part in formal processions from their apartments to their respective chambers the strangers bar is one of the numerous bars cafeterias and restaurants in the palace of westminster with differing rules regarding who is allowed to use their facilities many of them never close while the house is sitting there is also a gymnasium a hair salon and a rifle range parliament also has two souvenir shops where items on sale range from house of commons key rings and china to house of commons champagne the lady usher of the black rod oversees security for the house of lords and the serjeant at arms does the same for the house of commons these officers however have primarily ceremonial roles outside the actual chambers of their respective houses security is the responsibility of the parliamentary security director parliament has its own professional security force tradition still dictates that only the serjeant at arms may enter the commons chamber armed with rising concern about the possibility that a vehicle full of explosives could be driven into the building a series of concrete blocks were placed in the roadway in on the river an exclusion zone extending metres yd from the bank exists which no unauthorised vessels are allowed to enter the serious organised crime and police act formerly made it illegal to hold a protest near the palace or anywhere else within a designated area extending up to kilometre mi from parliament square without authorisation from the metropolitan police the act also restricted the operation of loudspeakers in the designated area these provisions were repealed by the police reform and social responsibility act which replaced them with a total ban on tents and sleeping bags in parliament square as well as a prohibition on the use of loudspeakers in the square without permission from the relevant local authority members of the public continue to have access to the strangers gallery in the house of commons visitors pass through metal detectors and their possessions are scanned police from the palace of westminster division of the metropolitan police supported by some armed police from the diplomatic protection group are always on duty in and around the palace the failed gunpowder plot of was a conspiracy among a group of roman catholic gentry to re establish catholicism in england by assassinating the protestant king james i and replacing him with a catholic monarch to this end they placed large quantities of gunpowder beneath the house of lords which one of the conspirators guy fawkes would detonate during the state opening of parliament on november if successful the explosion would have destroyed the palace killing the king his family and most of the aristocracy however the plot was discovered and most of the conspirators were either arrested or killed while trying to evade capture the survivors were tortured in the tower of london tried for high treason in westminster hall convicted and gruesomely executed by hanging drawing and quartering since then the cellars of the palace have been searched by the yeomen of the guard before every state opening of parliament a traditional precaution against any similar attempts against the sovereign sir walter raleigh was executed at the palace of westminster on october the previous palace of westminster was also the site of a prime ministerial assassination on may while in the lobby of the house of commons on his way to a parliamentary inquiry spencer perceval was shot and killed by a liverpool merchant adventurer john bellingham perceval remains the only british prime minister to have been assassinated the new palace became the target of fenian bombs on january along with the tower of london the first bomb a black bag containing dynamite was discovered by a visitor on the steps towards the chapel of st mary undercroft police constable pc william cole attempted to carry it to new palace yard but the bag became so hot that cole dropped it and it exploded the blast opened a crater in the floor metre ft in diameter damaged the roof of the chapel and shattered all the windows in the hall including the stained glass south window at st stephen s porch both cole and pc cox a colleague who had joined him to offer assistance were seriously injured a second explosion followed almost immediately in the commons chamber causing great damage especially to its south end but no injuries as it was empty at the time the incident resulted in the closure of westminster hall to visitors for several years when visitors were re admitted in it was under certain restrictions and never while the two houses were sitting on june a kilogram lb bomb planted by the provisional ira exploded in westminster hall the explosion and the resulting fire which was fed by a ruptured gas main injured people and caused extensive damage five years later a car bomb claimed the life of airey neave a prominent conservative politician while he was driving out of the commons car park in new palace yard the attack occurred on march one day after the announcement of that year s general election both the irish national liberation army and the provisional ira claimed responsibility for neave s assassination but it is now accepted that the former were responsible the palace has also been the scene of numerous acts of politically motivated direct action which often took place in the chamber of the house of commons in july a man in the strangers gallery threw two canisters of tear gas into the chamber to protest against the use of such gas in northern ireland an mp and two members of the house s staff were taken to hospital and the sitting was suspended for almost two hours in activist yana mintoff and another dissident threw bags of horse manure and in june demonstrators dropped leaflets note concern about such attacks and a possible chemical or biological attack led to the installation of a glass screen across the strangers gallery in early the new barrier does not cover the gallery in front of the strangers gallery which is reserved for ambassadors members of the house of lords guests of mps and other dignitaries and in may protesters from fathers justice attacked prime minister tony blair with flour bombs from this part after obtaining admission by bidding for a place in the visitors gallery in a charity auction subsequently rules on admission to the visitors galleries were changed and now individuals wishing to sit in the galleries must first obtain a written pass from a member certifying that that individual is personally known to them in september of the same year five protesters opposed to the proposed ban on fox hunting disrupted the proceedings of the house of commons by running into the chamber the first such occurrence since king charles i s unauthorised entry in which triggered the english civil war the house of lords has also been targeted by protesters on february the house debated the local government bill s controversial clause a measure to prohibit the promotion of homosexuality in schools following the division in which the clause passed a number of lesbian demonstrators in the public gallery started chanting slogans and three of them tied ropes to the railing and climbed down onto the floor of the chamber lord monkswell who had provided the women with passes to attend the debate later apologised to the house for the incident but did not criticise the protest similar actions have been carried out outside the palace of westminster early in the morning of march two greenpeace members scaled the clock tower to demonstrate against the iraq war raising questions about the security around such a likely target of terrorist attacks in march another four members of greenpeace made their way to the palace s roof by means of a nearby crane which was being used for repairs to westminster bridge once up they unfurled a metre ft banner protesting against the british government s plans to update the trident nuclear programme in february five campaigners from the plane stupid group gained admittance to the building as visitors and then moved up to the roof to demonstrate against the proposed expansion of heathrow airport from there they hung two banners they had smuggled past security mps and security experts found it worrying that the protesters made it to the roof in spite of the heightened security measures and the prosecution at the activists trial argued that they may have received help from a house of lords employee in october at least forty greenpeace activists climbed to the roof of westminster hall to call for the adoption of policies combating climate change some of them climbed down after nearly five hours while the rest spent the night on the roof note on march an islamist related terror attack happened in which a man stabbed a police officer after ploughing into pedestrians on westminster bridge five people were killed including the attacker and the police officer in august there was another attack treated by prosecutors as terrorism on april a group of environmental protestors from the group extinction rebellion stripped semi naked in the public gallery during a brexit debate and glued themselves to the handrail and glass screen with their buttocks facing the commons chamber mps attempted

police and officials the palace has accumulated many rules and traditions over the centuries smoking has not been allowed in the chamber of the house of commons since the th century as a result members may take snuff instead and the doorkeepers still keep a snuff box for this purpose despite persistent media rumours it has not been permitted to smoke anywhere inside the palace since members may not eat or drink in the chamber the exception to this rule is the chancellor of the exchequer who may have a beverage of the chancellors choice while delivering the budget statement traditionally this is an alcoholic beverage often whisky or a similar spirit but in recent times some chancellors have opted for mineral water men are expected to wear formal attire women are expected to dress in

similarly the reading of newspapers is not allowed visual aids are discouraged in the chamber applause is also not normally allowed in the commons but it has since been tolerated in certain cases some notable exceptions to this were when robin cook gave his resignation speech in when prime minister tony blair appeared for the last time at prime minister s questions when speaker michael martin gave his leaving speech on june and after the resignation statement of sir robert rogers clerk of the house at the start of the new parliament in may the large influx of new scottish national party mps

 the mausoleum at halicarnassus or tomb of mausolus a ancient greek turkish halikarnas mozolesi was a tomb built between and bc in halicarnassus present bodrum turkey for mausolus an anatolian from caria and a satrap in the achaemenid empire and his sister wife artemisia ii of caria the structure was designed by the greek architects satyros and pythius of priene its elevated tomb structure is derived from the tombs of neighbouring lycia a territory mausolus had invaded and annexed c bc such as the nereid monument the mausoleum was approximately m ft in height and the four sides were adorned with sculptural reliefs each created by one of four greek sculptors leochares bryaxis scopas of paros and timotheus the mausoleum was considered to be such an aesthetic triumph that antipater of sidon identified it as one of his seven wonders of the ancient world it was destroyed by successive earthquakes from the th to the th century it was the last surviving of the six destroyed wonders the word mausoleum has now come to be used generically for an above ground tomb in the th century bc halicarnassus was the capital of a small regional kingdom of caria within the achaemenid empire on the western coast of asia minor in bc the nominal ruler of the region hecatomnus of milas died and left control of the kingdom to his son mausolus hecatomnus a local dynast under the persians took control of several of the neighboring cities and districts after artemisia and mausolus he had several other daughters and sons ada adoptive mother of alexander the great idrieus and pixodarus mausolus extended his territory as far as the southwest coast of anatolia invading in particular the territory of lycia remarkable for its numerous monumental tombs such as the tombs at xanthos from which he took his inspiration for his mausoleum artemisia and mausolus ruled from halicarnassus over the surrounding territory for years mausolus although descended from local people spoke greek and admired the greek way of life and government he founded many cities of greek design along the coast and encouraged greek democratic traditions citation needed mausolus decided to build a new capital one as safe from capture as it was magnificent to be seen he chose the city of halicarnassus artemisia and mausolus spent huge amounts of tax money to embellish the city they commissioned statues temples and buildings of gleaming marble in bc mausolus died leaving artemisia to rule alone as the persian satrap and as the hecatomnid dynast mausolus had planned for himself an elaborate tomb when he died the project was continued by his siblings the tomb became so famous that mausolus s name is now the eponym for all stately tombs in the word mausoleum citation needed artemisia lived for only two years after the death of her husband the urns with their ashes were placed in the yet unfinished tomb as a form of sacrifice the bodies of a large number of dead animals were placed on the stairs leading to the tomb and then the stairs were filled with stones and rubble sealing the access according to the historian pliny the elder the craftsmen decided to stay and finish the work after the death of their patron considering that it was at once a memorial of his own fame and of the sculptor s art citation needed it is likely that mausolus started to plan the tomb before his death as part of the building works in halicarnassus so that when he died artemisia continued the building project artemisia spared no expense in building the tomb she sent messengers to greece to find the most talented artists of the time these included scopas the man who had supervised the rebuilding of the temple of artemis at ephesus the famous sculptors were in the vitruvius order leochares bryaxis scopas and timotheus as well as hundreds of other craftsmen the tomb was erected on a hill overlooking the city the whole structure sat in an enclosed courtyard at the center of the courtyard was a stone platform on which the tomb sat a stairway flanked by stone lions led to the top of the platform which bore along its outer walls many statues of gods and goddesses at each corner stone warriors mounted on horseback guarded the tomb at the center of the platform the marble tomb rose as a square tapering block to one third of the mausoleum s m ft height this section was covered with bas reliefs showing action scenes including the battle of the centaurs with the lapiths and greeks in combat with the amazons a race of warrior women citation needed on the top of this section of the tomb thirty six slim columns ten per side with each corner sharing one column between two sides rose for another third of the height standing between each pair of columns was a statue behind the columns was a solid cella like block that carried the weight of the tomb s massive roof the roof which comprised most of the final third of the height was pyramidal perched on the top was a quadriga four massive horses pulling a chariot in which rode images of mausolus and artemisia citation needed modern historians have pointed out that two years would not be enough time to decorate and build such a complex and extravagant building therefore it is believed that construction was begun by mausolus before his death or continued by the next leaders the mausoleum of halicarnassus resembled a temple and the only way to tell the difference was its slightly higher outer walls the mausoleum was in the greek dominated area of halicarnassus which in was controlled by the achaemenid empire according to the roman architect vitruvius it was built by satyros and pytheus who wrote a treatise about it this treatise is now lost pausanias adds that the romans considered the mausoleum one of the greatest wonders of the world and it was for that reason that they called all their magnificent tombs mausolea after it it is unknown exactly when and how the mausoleum came to ruin eustathius writing in the th century on his commentary of the iliad says it was and is a wonder because of this fergusson concluded that the building was ruined probably by an earthquake between this period and when the knights of st john of jerusalem arrived and recorded that it was in ruins however luttrell notes that at that time the local greeks and turks had no name for or legends to account for the colossal ruins suggesting a destruction at a much earlier period many of the stones from the ruins were used by the knights to fortify their castle at bodrum they also recovered bas reliefs with which they decorated the new building much of the marble was burned into lime in lord stratford de redcliffe obtained permission to remove these reliefs from the bodrum at the original site all that remained by the th century were the foundations and some broken sculptures this site was originally indicated by professor donaldson and was discovered definitively by charles newton after which an expedition was sent by the british government the expedition lasted three years and ended in the sending of the remaining marbles at some point before or after this grave robbers broke into and destroyed the underground burial chamber but in there was still enough of it remaining to determine a layout of the chambers when they were excavated this monument was ranked the seventh wonder of the world by the ancients not because of its size or strength but because of the beauty of its design and how it was decorated with sculpture or ornaments the mausoleum was halicarnassus principal architectural monument standing in a dominant position on rising ground above the harbor a jar in calcite or alabaster an alabastron with the quadrilingual signature of achaemenid ruler xerxes i ruled bc was discovered in the ruins of the mausoleum at the foot of the western staircase the vase contains an inscription in old persian egyptian babylonian and elamite x ay r x vazraka xerxes the great king such jars of egyptian origin were very precious to the achaemenids and may therefore have been offered by xerxes to carian rulers and then kept as a precious object in particular the precious jar may have been offered by xerxes to the carian dynast artemisia i who had acted with merit as his only female admiral during the second persian invasion of greece and particularly at the battle of salamis the jar testifies to the close contacts between carian rulers and the achaemenid empire much of the information that has been gathered about the mausoleum and its structure has come from the roman polymath pliny the elder he wrote some basic facts about the architecture and some dimensions the building was rectangular not square surrounded by a colonnade of thirty six columns there was a pyramidal superstructure receding in twenty four steps to the summit on top there were horse chariots of marble the building was accented with both sculptural friezes and free standing figures the free standing figures were arranged on or different levels we are now able to justify that pliny s knowledge came from a work written by the architect it is clear that pliny did not grasp the design of the mausoleum fully which creates problems in recreating the structure he does state many facts which help the reader recreate pieces of the puzzle other writings by pausanias strabo and vitruvius also help us to gather more information about the mausoleum according to pliny the mausoleum was metres ft north and south shorter on other fronts metres ft perimeter and cubits metres or feet in height it was surrounded by columns they called this part the pteron above the pteron there was a pyramid on top with steps and equal in height to the lower part the height of the building was metres ft the only other author that gives the dimensions of the mausoleum is hyginus a grammarian in the time of augustus he describes the monument as built with shining stones metres ft high and metres ft in circumference he likely meant cubits which would match pliny s dimensions exactly but this text is largely considered corrupt and is of little importance we learn from vitruvius that satyros and phytheus wrote a description of their work which pliny likely read pliny likely wrote down these dimensions without thinking about the form of the building a number of statues were found slightly larger than life size either metres ft or metres ft in length these were lion statues another important find was the depth on the rock on which the building stood this rock was excavated to or metres or ft deep over an area by metres by ft the sculptures on the north were created by scopas the ones on the east bryaxis on the south timotheus and on the west leochares the mausoleum was adorned with many great and beautiful sculptures some of these sculptures have been lost or only fragments have been found several of the statues original placements are only known through historical accounts the great figures of mausolus and artemisia stood in the chariot at the top of the pyramid the detached equestrian groups are placed at the corners of the sub podium the semi colossal female heads they may have belonged to the acroteria of the two gables which may have represented the six carian towns incorporated in halicarnassus work still continues today as groups continue to excavate and research the mausoleum s art the mausoleum overlooked the city of halicarnassus for many years it was untouched when the city fell to alexander the great in bc and still undamaged after attacks by pirates in and bc it stood above the city s ruins for sixteen centuries then a series of earthquakes shattered the columns and sent the bronze chariot crashing to the ground by ad only the base of the mausoleum was still recognizable the knights of st john of rhodes invaded the region and built bodrum castle castle of saint peter when they decided to fortify it in they used the stones of the mausoleum this is also about when imaginative reconstructions of the mausoleum began to appear in rumours of a turkish invasion caused the crusaders to strengthen the castle at halicarnassus which was by then known as bodrum and much of the remaining portions of the tomb were broken up and used in the castle walls sections of polished marble from the tomb can still be seen there today suleiman the magnificent conquered the base of the knights on the island of rhodes who then relocated first briefly to sicily and later permanently to malta leaving the castle and bodrum to the ottoman empire citation needed during the fortification work a party of knights entered the base of the monument and discovered the room containing a great coffin in many histories of the mausoleum one can find the following story of what happened the party deciding it was too late to open it that day returned the next morning to find the tomb and any treasure it may have contained plundered the bodies of mausolus and artemisia were missing too the small museum building next to the site of the mausoleum tells the story research done by archeologists in the s shows that long before the knights came grave robbers had dug a tunnel under the grave chamber stealing its contents also the museum states that it is most likely that mausolus and artemisia were cremated so only an urn with their ashes was placed in the grave chamber this explains why no bodies were found citation needed before grinding and burning much of the remaining sculpture of the mausoleum into lime for plaster the knights removed several of the best works and mounted them in the bodrum castle there they stayed for three centuries citation needed in the th century a british consul obtained several of the statues from bodrum castle these now reside in the british museum in the british museum sent the archaeologist charles thomas newton to search for more remains of the mausoleum he had a difficult job he did not know the exact location of the tomb and the cost of buying up all the small parcels of land in the area to look for it would have been astronomical instead newton studied the accounts of ancient writers like pliny to obtain the approximate size and location of the memorial then bought a plot of land in the most likely location digging down newton explored the surrounding area through tunnels he dug under the surrounding plots he was able to locate some walls a staircase and finally three of the corners of the foundation with this knowledge newton was able to determine which plots of land he needed to buy newton then excavated the site and found sections of the reliefs that decorated the wall of the building and portions of the stepped roof also discovered was a broken stone chariot wheel some m ft in in diameter which came from the sculpture on the mausoleum s roof finally he found the statues of mausolus and artemisia that had stood at the pinnacle of the building in october newton carried blocks of marble from this site by hms supply and landed them in malta these blocks were used for the construction of a new dock in malta for the royal navy today this dock is known at dock no in cospicua but the building blocks are hidden from view submerged in dockyard creek in the grand harbour from to the mausoleum was thoroughly researched by prof kristian jeppesen of aarhus university denmark he has produced a six volume monograph the maussolleion at halikarnassos the beauty of the mausoleum was not only in the structure itself but in the decorations and statues that adorned the outside at different levels on the podium and the roof statues of people lions horses and other animals in varying scales the four greek sculptors who carved the statues bryaxis leochares scopas and timotheus were each responsible for one side because the statues were of people and animals the mausoleum holds a special place in history as it was not dedicated to the gods of ancient greece today the massive castle of the knights hospitaller knights of st john still stands in bodrum and the polished stone and marble blocks of the mausoleum can be spotted built into the walls of the structure at the site of the mausoleum only the foundation remains and a small museum some of the surviving sculptures at the british museum include fragments of statues and many slabs of the frieze showing the battle between the greeks and the amazons there the images of mausolus and his queen watch over the few broken remains of the beautiful tomb she built for him reconstruction of the amazonomachy can be seen in the left background british museum room statue usually identified as artemisia reconstruction of the amazonomachy can be seen in the left background british museum room this lion is among the few free standing sculptures from the mausoleum at the british museum slab from the amazonomachy believed to show herculeas grabbing the hair of the amazon queen hippolyta

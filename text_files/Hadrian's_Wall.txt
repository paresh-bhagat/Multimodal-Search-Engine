 hadrian s wall latin vallum aelium also known as the roman wall picts wall or vallum hadriani in latin is a former defensive fortification of the roman province of britannia begun in ad in the reign of the emperor hadrian running from wallsend on the river tyne in the east to bowness on solway in the west of what is now northern england it was a stone wall with large ditches in front of it and behind it that crossed the whole width of the island soldiers were garrisoned along the line of the wall in large forts smaller milecastles and intervening turrets in addition to the wall s defensive military role its gates may have been customs posts a significant portion of the wall still stands and can be followed on foot along the adjoining hadrian s wall path the largest roman archaeological feature in britain it runs a total of miles kilometres in northern england regarded as a british cultural icon hadrian s wall is one of britain s major ancient tourist attractions it was designated as a unesco world heritage site in the turf built antonine wall in what is now central scotland which briefly superseded hadrian s wall before being abandoned was declared a world heritage site in hadrian s wall marked the boundary between roman britannia and unconquered caledonia to the north a the wall lies entirely within england and has never officially formed the anglo scottish border since roman times though it is often loosely or colloquially described as being such the length of the wall was roman miles a unit of length equivalent to about yards or metres or modern miles kilometres this covered the entire width of the island from wallsend on the river tyne in the east to bowness on solway in the west not long after construction began on the wall its width was reduced from the originally planned feet m to about feet m or even less depending on the terrain as some areas were constructed of turf and timber it would take decades for certain areas to be modified and replaced by stone bede a medieval historian wrote that the wall stood feet metres high with evidence suggesting it could have been a few feet higher at its formation r s o tomlin argues that along the miles long wall there would have been a tower every third of a mile adding more to the dimensions of the structure as evident by the plentiful remains of the turrets hadrian s wall extended west from segedunum at wallsend on the river tyne via carlisle and kirkandrews on eden to the shore of the solway firth ending a short but unknown distance west of the village of bowness on solway the a and b roads follow the course of the wall from newcastle upon tyne to carlisle then along the northern coast of cumbria south shore of the solway firth the route was slightly north of stanegate an important roman road built several decades earlier to link two forts that guarded important river crossings corstopitum corbridge on the river tyne and luguvalium carlisle on the river eden although the curtain wall ends near bowness on solway this does not mark the end of the line of defensive structures the system of milecastles and turrets is known to have continued along the cumbria coast as far as risehow south of maryport for classification purposes the milecastles west of bowness on solway are referred to as milefortlets hadrian s wall was probably planned before hadrian s visit to britain in according to restored sandstone fragments found in jarrow which date from or it was hadrian s wish to keep intact the empire which had been imposed on him via divine instruction one comment on the military purpose of the wall was that if there are troublesome tribes to the north and you want to keep them out you build a strong defensive wall the historia augusta also states that hadrian was the first to build a wall miles km from sea to sea to separate the barbarians from the romans however this reasoning may not entirely explain all the various motivations hadrian could have had in mind when commissioning the wall s construction on hadrian s accession to the imperial throne in there was unrest and rebellion in roman britain and from the peoples of various conquered lands across the empire including egypt judea libya and mauretania these troubles may have influenced his plan to construct the wall as well as his construction of frontier boundaries now known as limes in other areas of the empire such as the limes germanicus in modern day germany scholars disagree over how much of a threat the inhabitants of northern britain really presented to the romans and whether there was any economic advantage in defending and garrisoning a fixed line of defences like the wall rather than conquering and annexing what has become northumberland and the scottish lowlands and then defending the territory with a looser arrangement of forts besides a defensive structure made to keep people out the wall also kept people within the roman province since the romans had control over who was allowed in and out of the empire the wall was invaluable in controlling trading and the economy the wall also had a psychological impact for nearly three centuries until the end of roman rule in britain in ad hadrian s wall was the clearest statement of the might resourcefulness and determination of an individual emperor and of his empire the wall also provided years of work for thousands of soldiers who were responsible for building and maintaining the structure which gave the further benefit of preventing any boredom for the soldiers it would appear that the wall s primary purpose was as a physical barrier to slow the crossing of raiders and people intent on getting into the empire for destructive or plundering purposes and so having reformed the army quite in the manner of a monarch he set out for britain and there he corrected many abuses and was the first to construct a wall eighty miles in length which was to separate the barbarians from the romans historia augusta life of hadrian hadrian s wall was not only a defensive structure but also a symbolic statement of rome s imperial power marking the border between the so called civilized world and the unconquered barbarian wilderness as the british archaeologist neil faulkner explains the wall like other great roman frontier monuments was as much a propaganda statement as a functional facility it may be that it was not a last stand type of defensive line but instead an observation point that could alert romans of an incoming attack and act as a deterrent to slow down enemy forces so that additional troops could arrive for support this view is supported by another defensive measure frequently found on the berm or flat area in front of the wall pits or holes known as cippi pits which held branches or small tree trunks entangled with sharpened branches these were the cippi the use of such thorns and sharpened stakes was clearly an anti personnel measure and might be thought of as the roman equivalent of barbed wire once its construction was finished there is some evidence that hadrian s wall was covered in plaster and then whitewashed its shining surface would have reflected the sunlight and been visible for miles around hadrian ended his predecessor trajan s policy of expanding the empire and instead focused on defending the current borders namely at the time britain like augustus hadrian believed in exploiting natural boundaries such as rivers for the borders of the empire for example the euphrates rhine and danube britain however did not have any natural boundaries that could serve this purpose to divide the province controlled by the romans from the celtic tribes in the north with construction starting in the entire length of the wall was built with an alternating series of forts each housing men and manned milecastles operated by between and men it took six years to build most of hadrian s wall with the work coming from three roman legions the legio ii augusta legio vi victrix and legio xx valeria victrix totalling soldiers plus some members of the roman fleet the building of the wall was not out of the area of expertise for the soldiers some would have trained to be surveyors engineers masons and carpenters r g collingwood cited evidence for the existence of a broad section of the wall and conversely a narrow section he argued that plans changed during construction of the wall and its overall width was reduced broad sections of the wall are around nine and a half feet metres wide with the narrow sections two feet centimetres thinner around seven and a half feet metres wide the narrow sections were found to be built upon broad foundations based on this evidence collingwood concluded that the wall was originally due to be built between present day newcastle and bowness with a uniform width of ten roman feet all in stone in the end only three fifths of it was built from stone and the remaining part in the west was a turf wall later rebuilt in stone plans possibly changed due to a lack of resources in an effort to preserve resources further the eastern half s width was therefore reduced from the original ten roman feet to eight with the remaining stones from the eastern half used for around miles kilometres of the turf wall in the west this reduction from the original ten roman feet to eight created the so called narrow wall just south of the wall there is a ten foot metre deep ditch like construction with two parallel mounds running north and south of it known as the vallum the vallum and the wall run more or less in parallel for almost the entire length of the wall except between the forts of newcastle and wallsend at the east end where the vallum may have been considered superfluous as a barrier on account of the close proximity of the river tyne the twin track of the wall and vallum led many th century thinkers to note and ponder their relation to one another some evidence appears to shows that the route of the wall was shifted to avoid the vallum possibly pointing to the vallum being an older construction r g collingwood therefore asserted in that the vallum was built before the wall in its final form collingwood also questioned whether the vallum was an original border built before the wall based on this the wall could be viewed as a new replacement border built to strengthen the romans definition of their territory in further research suggested that the vallum could not have been built before the wall because the vallum avoided one of the wall s milecastles this new discovery was continually supported by more evidence strengthening the idea that there was a simultaneous construction of the vallum and the wall other evidence still pointed in other slightly different directions evidence shows that the vallum preceded sections of the narrow wall specifically to account for this discrepancy couse suggests that either construction of the vallum began with the broad wall or it began when the narrow wall succeeded the broad wall but proceeded more quickly than that of the narrow wall from milecastle to the western terminus of the wall at bowness on solway the curtain wall was originally constructed from turf possibly due to the absence of limestone for the manufacture of mortar subsequently the turf wall was demolished and replaced with a stone wall this took place in two phases the first from the river irthing to a point west of milecastle during the reign of hadrian and the second following the reoccupation of hadrian s wall after the abandonment of the antonine wall though it has also been suggested that this second phase took place during the reign of septimius severus the line of the new stone wall follows the line of the turf wall apart from the stretch between milecastle and milecastle where the line of the stone wall is slightly further to the north in the stretch around milecastle tw it was built on a flat base with three to four courses of turf blocks a basal layer of cobbles was used westwards from milecastle at burgh by sands and possibly at milecastle where the underlying ground was boggy wooden piles were used at its base the now demolished turf wall was metres feet wide and built in courses of turf blocks measuring cm inches long by cm inches deep by cm inches high to a height estimated at around metres feet the north face is thought to have had a slope of whereas the south face is thought to have started vertical above the foundation quickly becoming much shallower above the stone curtain wall s foundations one or more footing courses were laid offsets were introduced above these footing courses on both the north and south faces which reduced the wall s width where the width of the curtain wall is stated it is in reference to the width above the offset two standards of offset have been identified standard a where the offset occurs above the first footing course and standard b where the offset occurs after the third or sometimes fourth footing course it is thought that following construction and when fully manned almost soldiers were stationed on hadrian s wall made up not of the legions who built it but by regiments of auxiliary infantry and cavalry drawn from the provinces following from this david breeze laid out the two basic functions for soldiers on or around hadrian s wall breeze says that soldiers who were stationed in the forts around the wall had the primary duty of defence at the same time the troops in the milecastles and turrets had the responsibility of frontier control evidence as breeze says for soldiers stationed in forts is far more pronounced than the ones in the milecastles and turrets breeze discusses three theories about the soldiers on hadrian s wall one these soldiers who manned the milecastles and turrets on the wall came from the forts near it two regiments from auxiliaries were specifically chosen for this role or three a special force was formed to man these stations breeze comes to the conclusion that through all the inscriptions gathered there were soldiers from three or even four auxiliary units at milecastles on the wall these units were cohors i batavorum cohors i vardullorum an un numbered pannonian cohort and a duplicarius from upper germany breeze adds that there appears to have been some legionaries as well at these milecastles breeze also continues saying that evidence is still open on whether soldiers who manned the milecastles were from nearby forts or were specifically chosen for this task and further adds that the balance of evidence perhaps lies towards the latter a surprise for breeze is that soldiers from the three british legions outnumbered the auxiliaries which goes against the assertion that legionaries would not be used on such detached duties further information on the garrisoning of the wall has been provided by the discovery of the vindolanda tablets just to the south of hadrian s wall such as the record of an inspection on may or when only of the full quota of belgae troops were present the rest being sick or otherwise absent after hadrian s death in the new emperor antoninus pius left the wall occupied in a support role essentially abandoning it he began building the antonine wall about kilometres mi north across the isthmus running west south west to east north east this turf wall ran roman miles or about km mi and had more forts than hadrian s wall this area later became known as the scottish lowlands sometimes referred to as the central belt or central lowlands antoninus was unable to conquer the northern tribes so when marcus aurelius became emperor he abandoned the antonine wall and reoccupied hadrian s wall as the main defensive barrier in in the emperor septimius severus again tried to conquer caledonia and temporarily reoccupied the antonine wall the campaign ended inconclusively and the romans eventually withdrew to hadrian s wall the early historian bede ad following gildas wrote circa ad the departing romans thinking that it might be some help to the allies britons whom they were forced to abandon constructed a strong stone wall from sea to sea in a straight line between the towns that had been there built for fear of the enemy where severus also had formerly built a rampart bede obviously identified gildas s stone wall as hadrian s wall built in the s and he would appear to have believed that the ditch and mound barrier known as the vallum just to the south of and contemporary with hadrian s wall was the rampart constructed by severus many centuries would pass before just who built what became apparent self published source in the same passage bede describes hadrian s wall as follows it is eight feet in breadth and twelve in height and as can be clearly seen to this day ran straight from east to west bede by his own account lived his whole life at jarrow just across the river tyne from the eastern end of the wall at wallsend so as he indicates he would have been very familiar with the wall what he does not say is whether there was a walkway along the top of the wall it might be thought likely that there was but if so it no longer exists in the late th century barbarian invasions economic decline and military coups loosened the empire s hold on britain by the estimated end of roman rule in britain the roman administration and its legions were gone and britain was left to look to its own defences and government archaeologists have revealed that some parts of the wall remained occupied well into the th century it has been suggested that some forts continued to be garrisoned by local britons under the control of a coel hen figure and former dux hadrian s wall fell into ruin and over the centuries the stone was reused in other local buildings enough survived in the th century for spolia from hadrian s wall illustrated at right to find its way into the construction of st paul s church in monkwearmouth jarrow abbey where bede was a monk it was presumably incorporated before the setting of the church s dedication stone still to be seen in the church dated april the wall fascinated john speed who published a set of maps of england and wales by county at the start of the th century he described it as the picts wall or pictes he uses both spellings a map of newecastle sic drawn in by william matthew described it as severus wall mistakenly giving it the name ascribed by bede to the vallum the maps for cumberland and northumberland not only show the wall as a major feature but are ornamented with drawings of roman finds together with in the case of the cumberland map a cartouche in which he sets out a description of the wall itself much of the wall has now disappeared long sections of it were used for roadbuilding in the th century especially by general wade to build a military road most of which lies beneath the present day b military road to move troops to crush the jacobite rising of the preservation of much of what remains can be credited to the antiquarian john clayton he trained as a lawyer and became town clerk of newcastle in the s he became enthusiastic about preserving the wall after a visit to chesters to prevent farmers taking stones from the wall he began buying some of the land on which the wall stood in he started purchasing property around steel rigg near crag lough eventually he controlled land from brunton to cawfields this stretch included the sites of chesters carrawburgh housesteads and vindolanda clayton carried out excavation at the fort at cilurnum and at housesteads and he excavated some milecastles clayton managed the farms he had acquired and succeeded in improving both the land and the livestock he used the profits from his farms for restoration work workmen were employed to restore sections of the wall generally up to a height of seven courses the best example of the clayton wall is at housesteads after clayton s death the estate passed to relatives and was soon lost to gambling eventually the national trust began acquiring the land on which the wall stands at wallington hall near morpeth there is a painting by william bell scott which shows a centurion supervising the building of the wall the centurion has been given the face of john clayton above right in workers for northumbrian water found a previously undiscovered metres ft section of the wall while repairing a water main in central newcastle upon tyne the company announced that the pipe would be angled to leave a buffer around the excavated trench hadrian s wall was declared a world heritage site in and in it became part of the transnational frontiers of the roman empire world heritage site which also includes sites in germany although hadrian s wall was declared a world heritage site in it remains unguarded enabling visitors to climb and stand on the wall although this is not encouraged as it could damage the historic structure on march a public event illuminating hadrian s wall took place which saw the route of the wall lit with beacons on august and september there was a second illumination of the wall as a digital art installation called connecting light which was part of the london festival in the organisations which manage the great wall of china and hadrian s wall signed an agreement to collaborate for the growth of tourism and for historical and cultural understanding of the monuments in a national trail footpath was opened that follows the line of the wall from wallsend to bowness on solway because of the fragile landscape walkers are asked to follow the path only in summer hadrian s wall was known in the roman period as the vallum wall and the discovery of the staffordshire moorlands pan pictured below right in staffordshire in has thrown further light on its name this copper alloy pan trulla from the nd century is inscribed with a series of names of roman forts along the western sector of the wall mais bowness on solway coggabata drumburgh vxelodvnvm stanwix camboglanna castlesteads this is followed by the words rigore vali aeli draconis hadrian s family name was aelius and the most likely reading of the inscription is valli aelii genitive hadrian s wall suggesting that the wall was called by the same name by contemporaries however another possibility is that it refers to the personal name aelius draco two bronze vessels that are very similar to the staffordshire moorlands pan are the rudge cup found in wiltshire in and the amiens skillet found in amiens in northern france in they also bear the latin names of hadrian s wall forts round their rims beneath which are representations of a turreted or battlemented wall thought to depict hadrian s wall sources the latin and romano celtic names of all of the hadrian s wall forts are known from the notitia dignitatum and other evidence such as inscriptions they are listed here from east to west in their latin and

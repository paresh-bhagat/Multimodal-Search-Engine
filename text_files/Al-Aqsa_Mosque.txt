the temple mount known from its arabic language name as the al aqsa mosque compound or simply as al aqsa mosque which serves as a namesake for the structure during the rule of either rashidun caliph umar or umayyad caliph mu awiya i a small prayer house on the compound was erected near the mosque s site the present day mosque located on the south wall of the compound was originally built by the fifth umayyad caliph abd al malik ibn marwan or the sixth umayyad caliph al walid i or both as a congregational mosque on the same axis as the dome of the rock a commemorative islamic monument after being destroyed in an earthquake in the mosque was rebuilt in by al mansur of the abbasid caliphate it was further expanded upon in by abbasid caliph al mahdi after which it consisted of fifteen aisles and a central dome however it was again destroyed during the jordan rift valley earthquake the mosque was rebuilt by al zahir of the fatimid caliphate who reduced it to seven aisles but adorned its interior with an elaborate central archway covered in vegetal mosaics the current structure preserves the th century outline during the periodic renovations undertaken the ruling islamic dynasties constructed additions to the mosque and its precincts such as its dome fa ade minarets and minbar and interior structure upon its capture by the crusaders in the mosque was used as a palace it was also the headquarters of the religious order of the knights templar after the area was recaptured by saladin in the structure s function as a mosque was restored more renovations repairs and expansion projects were undertaken in later centuries by the ayyubid sultanate the mamluk sultanate the ottoman empire the supreme muslim council of british palestine and during the jordanian occupation of the west bank since the beginning of the ongoing israeli occupation of the west bank the mosque has remained under the independent administration of the jerusalem islamic waqf al aqsa mosque is located in close proximity to various historical and holy sites in judaism and christianity most notably that of the temple in jerusalem the entire area has consequently held high geopolitical significance and has been a primary flashpoint in the israeli palestinian conflict the english term al aqsa mosque is the translation of both al masjid al aq and j mi al aq which have distinct meanings in arabic the former al masjid al aq refers to the quran s surah the furthest mosque and thus is used for whole compound of the temple mount also known as the haram al sharif while the latter name j mi al aq is used for the subject of this article the silver domed congregational mosque building arabic and persian writers such as th century geographer al muqaddasi th century scholar nasir khusraw th century geographer al idrisi and th century islamic scholar mujir al din as well as th century american and british orientalists edward robinson guy le strange and edward henry palmer explained that the term masjid al aqsa refers to the entire esplanade plaza also known as the temple mount or haram al sharif noble sanctuary i e the entire area including the dome of the rock the fountains the gates and the four minarets because none of these buildings existed at the time the quran was written al muqaddasi referred to the southern building the subject of this article as al mughatt the covered part and nasir khusraw referred to it with the persian word pushish also the covered part exactly as al mughatta or the maqsurah a part for the whole synecdoche the building is also referred to as al qibli mosque or al qibli chapel jami al qibli in reference to its location on the southern end of the compound as a result of the islamic qibla being moved from jerusalem to mecca qibli is the name used in official publications by the governmental organization which administers the site the jerusalem islamic waqf part of the jordanian government and the jordanian government more widely it is also the official name used by the palestinian liberation organization it has been used by numerous international organizations such as the united states state department the organisation of islamic cooperation whose role is to act as the collective voice of the muslim world and unesco as well as various scholars and media organizations the mosque is located on the southern part of the temple mount or haram al sharif an enclosure expanded by king herod the great beginning in bce during his reconstruction of the second jewish temple the mosque resides on an artificial platform that is supported by arches constructed by herod s engineers to overcome the difficult topographic conditions resulting from the southward expansion of the enclosure into the tyropoeon and kidron valleys during the late second temple period the present site of the mosque was occupied by the royal stoa a basilica running the southern wall of the enclosure the royal stoa was destroyed along with the temple during the siege of jerusalem by the romans in ce it was once thought that emperor justinian s nea ekklesia of the theotokos lit the new church of the god bearer and commonly known as the nea church dedicated to the god bearing virgin mary consecrated in was situated where al aqsa mosque was later constructed however remains identified as those of the nea church were uncovered in the south part of the jewish quarter in analysis of the wooden beams and panels removed from the mosque during renovations in the s shows they are made from lebanese cedar and cypress radiocarbon dating gave a large range of ages some as old as th century bce showing that some of the wood had previously been used in older buildings however reexamination of the same beams in the s gave dates in the byzantine period during his excavations in the s robert hamilton uncovered portions of a multicolor mosaic floor with geometric patterns but did not publish them the date of the mosaic is disputed zachi dvira considers that they are from the pre islamic byzantine period while baruch reich and sandhaus favor a much later umayyad origin on account of their similarity to a mosaic from an umayyad palace excavated adjacent to the temple mount s southern wall a mostly wooden rectangular mosque on the temple mount site with a capacity for worshippers is attested by the gallic monk arculf during his pilgrimage to jerusalem in c its precise location is not known the art historian oleg grabar deems it likely that it was close to the present mosque while the historian yildirim yavuz asserts it stood at the present site of the dome of rock the architectural historian k a c creswell notes that arculf s attestation lends credibility to claims by some islamic traditions and medieval christian chronicles which he otherwise deems legendary or unreliable that the second rashidun caliph umar r ordered the construction of a primitive mosque on the temple mount however arculf visited palestine during the reign of caliph mu awiya i r founder of the syria based umayyad caliphate mu awiya had been governor of syria including palestine for about twenty years before becoming caliph and his accession ceremony was held in jerusalem the th century jerusalemite scholar al mutahhar ibn tahir al maqdisi claims mu awiya built a mosque on the haram there is disagreement as to whether the present al aqsa mosque was originally built by the umayyad caliph abd al malik r or his successor his son al walid i r several architectural historians hold that abd al malik commissioned the project and that al walid finished or expanded it a abd al malik inaugurated great architectural works on the temple mount including construction of the dome of the rock in c a common islamic tradition holds that abd al malik simultaneously commissioned the dome of the rock and the al aqsa mosque as both were intentionally built on the same axis grabar comments that the two structures form part of an architecturally thought out ensemble comprising a congregational and a commemorative building the al aqsa mosque and the dome of the rock respectively b guy le strange claims that abd al malik used materials from the destroyed church of our lady to build the mosque and points to possible evidence that substructures on the southeast corners of the mosque are remains of the church the earliest source indicating al walid s work on the mosque is the aphrodito papryi these contain the letters between al walid s governor of egypt in december june and a government official in upper egypt which discuss the dispatch of egyptian laborers and craftsmen to help build the al aqsa mosque referred to as the mosque of jerusalem the referenced workers spent between six months and a year on the construction several th and th century historians credit al walid for founding the mosque though the historian amikam elad doubts their reliability on the matter c in a series of earthquakes ravaged jerusalem destroying the eastern section of the mosque which was subsequently rebuilt by al walid s order he had gold from the dome of the rock melted to use as money to finance the repairs and renovations he is credited by the early th century historian al qalqashandi for covering the mosque s walls with mosaics grabar notes that the umayyad era mosque was adorned with mosaics marble and remarkable crafted and painted woodwork the latter are preserved partly in the palestine archaeological museum and partly in the islamic museum proposed estimates of the size of the umayyad built mosque by architectural historians range from by meters ft ft and by meters ft ft the building was rectangular in the assessment of grabar the layout was a modified version of the traditional hypostyle mosque of the period its unusual characteristic was that its aisles laid perpendicular to the qibla wall the number of aisles is not definitively known though fifteen is cited by a number of historians the central aisle double the width of the others was probably topped by a dome the last years of umayyad rule were turbulent for jerusalem the last umayyad caliph marwan ii r punished jerusalem s inhabitants for supporting a rebellion against him by rival princes and tore down the city s walls in the al aqsa mosque was ruined in an earthquake four years later the umayyads were toppled and replaced by the iraq based abbasid caliphate the abbasids generally exhibited little interest in jerusalem though the historian shelomo dov goitein notes they paid special tribute to the city during the early part of their rule and grabar asserts that the early abbasids work on the mosque suggests a major attempt to assert abbasid sponsorship of holy places nevertheless in contrast to the umayyad period maintenance of the al aqsa mosque during abbasid rule often came at the initiative of the local muslim community rather than from the caliph the second abbasid caliph al mansur r visited jerusalem in on his return from the hajj pilgrimage to mecca he found the structures on the haram in ruins from the earthquake including the al aqsa mosque according to the tradition cited by mujir al din the caliph was beseeched by the city s muslim residents to fund the buildings restoration in response he had the gold and silver plaques covering the mosque s doors converted into dinars and dirhams to finance the reconstruction a second earthquake damaged most of al mansur s repairs except for the southern portion near the mihrab prayer niche indicating the qibla in his successor al mahdi ordered its reconstruction mandating that his provincial governors and other commanders each contribute the cost of a colonnade al mahdi s renovation is the first known to have written records describing it the jerusalemite geographer al muqaddasi writing in provided the following description this mosque is even more beautiful than that of damascus the edifice after al mahdi s reconstruction rose firmer and more substantial than ever it had been in former times the more ancient portion remained even like a beauty spot in the midst of the new the aqsa mosque has twenty six doors the centre of the main building is covered by a mighty roof high pitched and gable wise over which rises a magnificent dome al muqaddasi further noted that the mosque consisted of fifteen aisles aligned perpendicularly to the qibla and possessed an elaborately decorated porch with the names of the abbasid caliphs inscribed on its gates according to hamilton al muqaddasi s description of the abbasid era mosque is corroborated by his archaeological findings in which showed the abbasid construction retained some parts of the older structure and had a broad central aisle topped by a dome the mosque described by al muqaddasi opened to the north toward the dome of the rock and unusually according to grabar to the east other than al mansur and al mahdi no other abbasid caliphs visited jerusalem or commissioned work on the al aqsa mosque though caliph al ma mun r ordered significant work elsewhere on the haram he also contributed a bronze portal to the mosque s interior and the geographer nasir khusraw noted during his visit that al ma mun s name was inscribed on it abd allah ibn tahir the abbasid governor of the eastern province of khurasan r is credited by al muqaddasi for building a colonnade on marble pillars in front of the fifteen doors on the mosque s front north side in the egypt based fatimid caliphate conquered palestine from the ikhshidids nominal allegiants of the abbasids unlike the abbasids and the muslim inhabitants of jerusalem who were sunnis the fatimids followed shia islam in its isma ili form in another earthquake severely damaged the mosque the fatimid caliph al zahir r had the mosque reconstructed between and though work was not completed until during the reign of caliph al mustansir r the new mosque was considerably smaller reduced from fifteen aisles to seven probably a reflection of the local population s significant decline by this time d excluding the two aisles on each side of the central nave each aisle was made up of eleven arches running perpendicular to the qibla the central nave was twice the breadth of the other aisles and had a gabled roof with a dome e the mosque likely lacked the side doors of its predecessor a prominent and distinctive feature of the new construction was the rich mosaic program endowed to the drum of the dome the pendentives leading to the dome and the arch in front of the mihrab these three adjoining areas covered by the mosaics are collectively referred to as the triumphal arch by grabar or the maqsura by pruitt mosaic designs were rare in islamic architecture in the post umayyad era and al zahir s mosaics were a revival of this umayyad architectural practice including abd al malik s mosaics in the dome of the rock but on a larger scale the drum mosaic depicts a luxurious garden inspired by the umayyad or classical style the four pendentives are gold and characterized by indented roundels with alternating gold and silver planes and patterns of peacock s eyes eight pointed stars and palm fronds on the arch are large depictions of vegetation emanating from small vases atop the mihrab arch is a lengthy inscription in gold directly linking the al aqsa mosque with muhammad s night journey the isra and mi raj from the masjid al haram to the masjid al aqsa it marked the first instance of this quranic verse being inscribed in jerusalem leading grabar to hypothesize that it was an official move by the fatimids to magnify the site s sacred character the inscription credits al zahir for renovating the mosque and two otherwise unknown figures abu al wasim and a sharif al hasan al husayni for supervising the work f nasir khusraw described the mosque during his visit he deemed it very large measuring by cubits on its western side the distance between each sculptured marble column in number was six cubits the columns were supported by stone arches and lead joints he noted the following features the mosque is everywhere flagged with coloured marble the maksurah or space railed off for the officials is facing the centre of the south wall of the mosque and haram area and is of such size as to contain sixteen columns above rises a mighty dome that is ornamented with enamel work al zahir s substantial investment in the haram including the al aqsa mosque amid the political instability in the capital cairo rebellions by bedouin tribes especially the jarrahids of palestine and plagues indicate the caliph s commitment to jerusalem in pruitt s words although the city had experienced decreases in its population in the preceding decades the fatimids attempted to build up the magnificence and symbolism of the mosque and the haram in general for their own religious and political reasons g the present day mosque largely retains al zahir s plan fatimid investment in jerusalem ground to a halt toward the end of the th century as their rule became further destabilized in a turkish mercenary atsiz was invited by the city s fatimid governor to rein in the bedouin but he turned on the fatimids besieging and capturing jerusalem that year a few years later the inhabitants revolted against him and were slaughtered by atsiz including those who had taken shelter in the al aqsa mosque he was killed by the turkish seljuks in establishing seljuk rule over the city which lasted until the fatimids regained control in jerusalem was captured by the crusaders in during the first crusade they named the mosque templum solomonis solomon s temple distinguishing it from the dome of the rock which they named templum domini temple of god while the dome of the rock was turned into a christian church under the care of the augustinians the al aqsa mosque was used as a royal palace and also as a stable for horses in the crusader king accommodated the headquarters of the knights templar next to his palace within the building during this period the mosque underwent some structural changes including the expansion of its northern porch and the addition of an apse and a dividing wall a new cloister and church were also built at the site along with various other structures the templars constructed vaulted western and eastern annexes to the building the western currently serves as the women s mosque and the eastern as the islamic museum after the ayyubids under the leadership of saladin reconquered jerusalem following the siege of several repairs and renovations were undertaken at al aqsa mosque in order to prepare the mosque for friday prayers within a week of his capture of jerusalem saladin had the toilets and grain stores installed by the crusaders at al aqsa removed the floors covered with precious carpets and its interior scented with rosewater and incense saladin s predecessor the zengid sultan nur al din had commissioned the construction of a new minbar or pulpit made of ivory and wood in but it was completed after his death nur ad din s minbar was added to the mosque in november by saladin the ayyubid sultan of damascus al mu azzam built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates in in the mamluks under al kamil shaban added two naves and two gates to the mosque s eastern side after the ottomans assumed power in they did not undertake any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself but they did to the noble sanctuary as a whole this included the building of the fountain of qasim pasha the restoration of the pool of raranj and the building of three free standing domes the most notable being the dome of the prophet built in all construction was ordered by the ottoman governors of jerusalem and not the sultans themselves the sultans did make additions to existing minarets however in the mosque was restored by governor sulayman pasha al adil after having been in a dilapidated state the first renovation in the th century occurred in when the supreme muslim council under amin al husayni the grand mufti of jerusalem commissioned turkish architect ahmet kemalettin bey to restore al aqsa mosque and the monuments in its precincts the council also commissioned british architects egyptian engineering experts and local officials to contribute to and oversee the repairs and additions which were carried out in by kemalettin the renovations included reinforcing the mosque s ancient umayyad foundations rectifying the interior columns replacing the beams erecting a scaffolding conserving the arches and drum of the main dome s interior rebuilding the southern wall and replacing timber in the central nave with a slab of concrete the renovations also revealed fatimid era mosaics and inscriptions on the interior arches that had been covered with plasterwork the arches were decorated with gold and green tinted gypsum and their timber tie beams were replaced with brass a quarter of the stained glass windows also were carefully renewed so as to preserve their original abbasid and fatimid designs severe damage was caused by the and earthquakes but the mosque was repaired in and an earthquake in and a small tremor in the summer of eventually brought down the roof of the aqsa mosque prompting the reconstruction of the upper part of the north wall of the mosque and the internal refacing of the whole the partial reconstruction of the jambs and lintels of the central doors the refacing of the front of five bays of the porch and the demolition of the vaulted buildings that formerly adjoined the east side of the mosque on july king abdullah i was shot three times by a palestinian gunman as he entered the mosque killing him his grandson prince hussein was at his side and was also hit though a medal he was wearing on his chest deflected the bullet on august a fire was started by a visitor from australia named denis michael rohan an evangelical christian who hoped that by burning down al aqsa mosque he would hasten the second coming of jesus in response to the incident a summit of islamic countries was held in rabat that same year hosted by faisal of saudi arabia the then king of saudi arabia the al aqsa fire is regarded as one of the catalysts for the formation of the organisation of the islamic conference oic now the organisation of islamic cooperation in following the fire the dome was reconstructed in concrete and covered with anodized aluminium instead of the original ribbed lead enamel work sheeting in the aluminium outer covering was replaced with lead to match the original design by az zahir in the s ben shoshan and yehuda etzion both members of the gush emunim underground plotted to blow up the al aqsa mosque and the dome of the rock etzion believed that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in israel and would solve all the problems of the jewish people they also hoped the third temple of jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque on november israeli police entered al aqsa for the first time since capturing jerusalem in said sheikh azzam al khatib director of the islamic waqf previous media reports of storming al aqsa referred to the haram al sharif compound rather than the al aqsa mosque itself the rectangular al aqsa mosque and its precincts cover hectares acres although the mosque itself is about acres ha in area and can hold up to worshippers it is m ft long m ft wide unlike the dome of the rock which reflects classical byzantine architecture the al aqsa mosque is characteristic of early islamic architecture nothing remains of the original dome built by abd al malik the present day dome mimicks that of az zahir which consisted of wood plated with lead enamelwork but which was destroyed by fire in today it is made of concrete with lead sheeting al aqsa s dome is one of the few domes to be built in front of the mihrab during the umayyad and abbasid periods the others being the umayyad mosque in damascus and the great mosque of sousse the interior of the dome is painted with th century era decorations during the burning the paintings were assumed to be irreparably lost but were completely reconstructed using the trateggio technique a method that uses fine vertical lines to distinguish reconstructed areas from original ones the facade of the mosque was built in ce on the instructions of the fatimid caliph al mustansir billah it was crowned with a balustrade consisting of arcades and small columns the crusaders damaged the facade but it was restored and renovated by the ayyubids one addition was the covering of the facade with tiles the second hand material of the facade s arches includes sculpted ornamental material taken from crusader structures in jerusalem the facade consists of fourteen stone arches dubious discuss most of which are of a romanesque style the outer arches added by the mamluks follow the same general design the entrance to the mosque is through the facade s central arch the porch is located at the top of dubious discuss the facade the central bays of the porch were built by the knights templar during the first crusade dubious discuss but saladin s nephew al mu azzam isa ordered the construction of the porch itself in dubious discuss the al aqsa mosque has seven aisles of hypostyle naves with several additional small halls to the west and east of the southern section of the building there are stained glass windows in the mosque from the abbasid and fatimid eras about a fourth of them were restored in the spandrels of the arch opposite the main entrance include a mosaic decoration and inscription dating back to fatimid period interior view of the mosque facing the mihrab view of the hypostyle prayer hall decorated wall above mihrab near central dome facing main entrance interior view of the mosque showing the mihrab indicating the qiblah inscription showing quran s aayat contributors name to restore dome of aqsa after burning interior decoration of aqsa main dome the original minbar installed under saladin the mihrab is visible to the left a man prays in the mosque in the mosque s interior is supported by columns of which are white marble and of stone the column rows of the central aisles are heavy and stunted the remaining four rows are better proportioned the capitals of the columns are of four different kinds those in the central aisle are heavy and primitively designed while those under the dome are of the corinthian order and made from italian white marble the capitals in the eastern aisle are of a heavy basket shaped design and those east and west of the dome are also basket shaped but smaller and better proportioned the columns and piers are connected by an architectural rave which consists of beams of roughly squared timber enclosed in a wooden casing a great portion of the mosque is covered with whitewash but the drum of the dome and the walls immediately beneath it are decorated with mosaics and marble some paintings by an italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in the ceiling of the mosque was painted with funding by king farouk of egypt the minbar of the mosque was built by a craftsman named akhtarini from aleppo on the orders of the zengid sultan nur ad din it was intended to be a gift for the mosque when nur ad din would capture jerusalem from the crusaders and took six years to build nur ad din died and the crusaders still controlled jerusalem but in saladin captured the city and the minbar was installed the structure was made of ivory and carefully crafted wood arabic calligraphy geometrical and floral designs were inscribed in the woodwork after its destruction by rohan in it was replaced by a much simpler minbar in january adnan al husayni head of the islamic waqf in charge of al aqsa stated that a new minbar would be installed it was installed in february the design of the new minbar was drawn by jamil badran based on an exact replica of the saladin minbar and was finished by badran within a period of five years the minbar itself was built in jordan over a period of four years and the craftsmen used ancient woodworking methods joining the pieces with pegs instead of nails but employed computer images to design the pulpit minbar the waqf ministry of jordan held control of the al aqsa mosque until the six day war after israel s victory in that war israel transferred the control of the mosque and the northern noble sanctuary to the islamic waqf trust who are independent of the israeli government however israeli security forces are permitted to patrol and conduct searches within the perimeter of the mosque after the arson attack the waqf employed architects technicians and craftsmen in a committee that carry out regular maintenance operations the islamic movement in israel and the waqf have attempted to increase muslim control of the temple mount as a way of countering israeli policies and the escalating presence of israeli security forces around the site since the second intifada some activities included refurbishing abandoned structures and renovating muhammad ahmad hussein is the head imam and manager of the al aqsa mosque and was assigned the role of grand mufti of jerusalem in by palestinian president mahmoud abbas ownership of the al aqsa mosque is a contentious issue in the israel palestinian conflict israel claims sovereignty over the mosque along with all of the temple mount noble sanctuary but palestinians hold the custodianship of the site through the islamic waqf during the negotiations at the camp david summit palestinians demanded complete ownership of the mosque and other islamic holy sites in east jerusalem muslim residents of israel and palestinians living in east jerusalem are normally allowed to enter the temple mount and pray at the al aqsa mosque without restrictions due to security measures the israeli government occasionally prevents certain groups of muslims from reaching al aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex the restrictions vary from time to time at times restrictions have prevented all men under and women under from entering but married men over are allowed sometimes the restrictions are enforced on the occasion of friday prayers other times they are over an extended period of time restrictions are most severe for gazans followed by restrictions on those from west bank the israeli government states that the restrictions are in place for security reasons until non muslim visitors could enter the al aqsa mosque by getting a ticket from the waqf that procedure ended when the second intifada began fifteen years later negotiation between israel and jordan might result in allowing visitors to enter once again several excavations outside the temple mount took place following the war in israeli authorities commenced intensive excavations outside the walls next to the mosque on the southern and western sides palestinians believed that tunnels were being dug under the al aqsa mosque in order to undermine its foundations which was denied by israelis who claimed that the closest excavation to the mosque was some meters ft to its south the archaeological department of the israeli ministry of religious affairs dug a tunnel near the western portion of the mosque in according to unesco s special envoy to jerusalem oleg grabar buildings and structures on the temple mount are deteriorating due mostly to disputes between the israeli palestinian and jordanian governments over who is actually responsible for the site in february the department started to excavate a site for archaeological remains in a location where the government wanted to rebuild a collapsed pedestrian bridge leading to the mughrabi gate the only entrance for non muslims into the temple mount complex this site was meters ft away from the mosque the excavations provoked anger throughout the islamic world and israel was accused of trying to destroy the foundation of the mosque ismail haniya then prime minister of the palestinian national authority and hamas leader called on palestinians to unite to protest the excavations while fatah said they would end their ceasefire with israel israel denied all charges against them calling them ludicrous in april during both passover and ramadan the site was a focus of tension between israeli settlers and palestinians jewish settlers broke an agreement between israel and jordan and performed prayers and read from the torah inside the compound an area normally off limits to non muslims on april israeli police entered the area and forcibly cut wires to speakers in minarets around the mosque silencing the call to prayer claiming the sound was interfering with an event by the israeli president at the western wall on april seventy thousand muslims prayed in the compound around the mosque the largest gathering since the beginning of the covid pandemic police barred most from entering the structure itself in may hundreds of palestinians were injured following clashes in the compound after reports of israel s intention to proceed to evict palestinians from land claimed by israeli settlers on april israeli forces entered the temple mount and used tear gas shells and sound bombs to disperse palestinians who they said were throwing stones at policemen some palestinians barricaded themselves inside the al aqsa mosque where they were detained by israeli police over people ended up injured and arrested in the name of god the compassionate the merciful glory to the one who took his servant for a journey by night from the masjid al

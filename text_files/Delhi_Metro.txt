metro map the delhi metro is a mass rapid transit mrt system serving delhi and its satellite cities of ghaziabad faridabad gurgaon noida bahadurgarh and ballabhgarh in the national capital region of india the network consists of colour coded lines serving stations a with a total length of kilometres mi b it is by far the largest and busiest metro rail system in india and the second oldest after the kolkata metro the system has a mix of underground at grade and elevated stations using both broad gauge and standard gauge delhi metro operates over trips daily starting at around and ending at construction started in and the first elevated section shahdara to tis hazari on the red line opened on december the first underground section vishwa vidyalaya kashmere gate on the yellow line opened on december the development of the network was divided into phases phase i with lines was completed by and phase ii in phase iii is in the finishing stage and is scheduled to be complete by end of construction under phase iv was formally started on december delhi metro rail corporation limited dmrc a company with equal equity participation from the government of india and the government of delhi built and operates the delhi metro dmrc was certified by the united nations in as the first metro rail and rail based system in the world to get carbon credits for reducing greenhouse gas emissions reducing carbon emission levels in the city by tonnes every year the delhi metro also has interchanges with the rapid metro gurgaon with a shared ticketing system and noida metro on october dmrc took over the operations of the financially troubled rapid metro gurgaon annual ridership of delhi metro was billion in the concept of mass rapid transit for new delhi first emerged from a traffic and travel characteristics study that was carried out in the city in over the next several years many official committees by a variety of government departments were commissioned to examine issues related to technology route alignment and governmental jurisdiction in the urban arts commission came up with a proposal for developing a multi modal transport system which would consist of constructing three underground mass rapid transit corridors as well as augmenting the city s existing suburban railway and road transport networks while extensive technical studies and the raising of finance for the project were in progress the city expanded significantly resulting in a two fold rise in population and a five fold rise in the number of vehicles between and consequently traffic congestion and pollution soared as an increasing number of commuters took to private vehicles with the existing bus system unable to bear the load an attempt at privatizing the bus transport system in merely compounded the problem with inexperienced operators plying poorly maintained noisy and polluting buses on lengthy routes resulting in long waiting times unreliable service extreme overcrowding unqualified drivers speeding and reckless driving which even led to road accidents to rectify the situation the government of india under prime minister h d deve gowda and the government of delhi jointly set up a company called the delhi metro rail corporation dmrc on may with elattuvalapil sreedharan as the managing director sreedharan handed over the charge as managing director of dmrc to mangu singh on december physical construction work on the delhi metro started on october after the previous problems experienced by the kolkata metro which was badly delayed and times over budget due to political meddling technical problems and bureaucratic delays dmrc is a special purpose organisation vested with great autonomy and powers to execute this gigantic project involving many technical complexities under a difficult urban environment and within a very limited time frame dmrc was given full powers to hire people decide on tenders and control funds the dmrc then hired the hong kong mtrc as a technical consultant on rapid transit operation and construction techniques as a result construction proceeded smoothly except for one major disagreement in where the ministry of railways forced the system to use ft in mm broad gauge despite the dmrc s preference for standard gauge the first line of the delhi metro the red line was inaugurated by atal bihari vajpayee the then prime minister of india on december the delhi metro became the second underground rapid transit system in india after the kolkata metro when the vishwa vidyalaya kashmere gate section of the yellow line opened on december this underground line was inaugurated by the then prime minister manmohan singh the first phase of the project was eventually completed in on budget and almost three years ahead of schedule an achievement described by business week as nothing short of a miracle a total of kilometres mi long network with stations and the following routes initial parts of red yellow and blue lines were built within the limits of delhi state stations progressively started to open from december to november a total of kilometres mi long network with stations and the following new routes and extensions was built out of which seven routes are extension spurs of the phase i network three were new colour coded lines and three routes connect to other cities yellow line to gurgaon blue line to noida and blue line to ghaziabad of the national capital region outside the physical limits of delhi state in the states of haryana and uttar pradesh at the end of phases i and ii the cumulative total length of the network became km mi with stations progressively becoming operational from june to august phase i red yellow and blue lines and phase ii green violet and orange lines focused on adding new radial lines to expand the network to further reduce congestion and improve connectivity phase iii included extensions to the existing lines as well as building two ring lines pink and magenta lines along with the grey line it has underground stations new lines and route extensions totaling kilometres mi with a cost of billion us billion the new lines of phase iii are the pink line running on inner ring road line the magenta line running on outer ring road line the grey line connecting dwarka and najafgarh line work on phase iii started in with being the planned deadline more than tunnel boring machines were used simultaneously to expedite the work however the actual work for the original was completed in march except for a small stretch due to non availability of land later certain small extensions to the delhi metro were added as part of the phase iii project only one of which is still under construction dwarka sector to ecc centre phase iii was expected to be completed by the end of but construction was delayed due to the covid pandemic it was finally completed on september with the opening of the grey line extension from najafgarh to dhansa bus stand driverless operations on the km long magenta line began on december making it the first driverless metro line of delhi metro and india s first driverless metro on november the km long pink line also began driverless train operations with this the total stretch of dmrc s network under driverless operations now stands at close to km putting delhi metro in fourth position globally among such networks marginally behind kuala lumpur the expected daily ridership of the whole network of all phases after the completion of phase iii was estimated at lakh passengers against this however the actual ridership of dmrc was lakh only i e percent of the projected ridership the actual ridership of the phase iii corridors was lakh only as against the projected ridership of lakh in which is a deficit of percent the communication based train control cbtc being used in phase iii trains enables trains to run at a short headway of seconds although the actual headway between trains is kept much higher because of the relatively low demand on the new corridors keeping the short headway and other constraints in mind dmrc changed its decision to build car long stations for new lines and instead opted for shorter stations which can accommodate car trains on october a launching gantry and a part of the overhead blue line extension under construction in laxmi nagar east delhi collapsed and fell on passing vehicles underneath workers were using a crane to lift a tonne concrete span of the bridge when the gantry collapsed along with a metre long ft span of the bridge on top of a blueline bus killing the driver and a labourer on july a section of a bridge collapsed while it was being erected at zamrudpur near east of kailash on the central secretariat badarpur corridor six people died and

spread over approximately years with each phase having a target of five years to be completed and the end of one phase marking the beginning of another phase i km or mi and phase ii km or mi were completed in and respectively phase iii totaling km mi was mostly completed on april except for a small section of the pink line between the mayur vihar pocket and trilokpuri sanjay lake stations as well as the grey line extension from najafgarh to dhansa bus stand which opened on august and september respectively phase iv of the network with a length of km mi and lines was finalized by the government of delhi in december approval from government of india was received for priority corridors in march construction work on these priority corridors having a length of km mi commenced on december with an expected completion date of therefore at the end of phase iv the total length of the delhi metro will exceed kilometres mi which does not include other independently operated systems in the national capital region such as the kilometres mi long aqua line of the noida greater noida metro and the kilometres mi of the rapid metro gurgaon that connect to the delhi metro this may make delhi metro the th longest metro system by route length after chengdu metro beijing subway shanghai metro and guangzhou metro former managing director of dmrc e sreedharan stated that by the time phase iv is completed the city will need phase v to cope with the rising population and transport needs planning work for phase v has not started however the following corridors while not specifically tied or approved to any expansion phase have been suggested to be constructed in the near future the trains operate at a frequency of one to two minutes to five to ten minutes between and depending upon the peak and off peak hours trains operating within the network typically travel at speed up to km h mph and stop for about seconds at each station automated station announcements are recorded in hindi and english many stations have services such as atms food outlets caf s convenience stores and mobile recharge eating drinking smoking and chewing gum are prohibited in the entire system the metro also has a sophisticated fire alarm system for advance warning in emergencies and fire retardant material is used in trains as well as on the premises of stations navigation information is available on google maps since october the first coach of every train is reserved for women however last coaches are also reserved when the train changes tracks at the terminal stations in the red green and violet lines to make travelling by metro a smoother experience delhi metro has launched its own official mobile app delhi metro rail for smartphone users iphone and android that will provide information on various facilities like the location of the nearest metro station fare parking availability tourist spots near metro stations security and emergency helpline numbers security on the delhi metro is handled by cisf unit dmrc of central industrial security force cisf who have been guarding the system ever since they took over from the delhi police in closed circuit cameras are used to monitor trains and stations and feed from these is monitored by both the cisf and delhi metro authorities at their respective control rooms over cisf personnel have been deployed for security of metro and its installations in addition to metal detectors x ray baggage inspection systems and dog squads which are used to secure the system to deal with law and order issues in the system delhi metro rail police a dedicated wing of delhi police stations have been established about cctv cameras have been installed which cover every nook and corner of each metro station each of the underground stations has about to cameras installed while the elevated stations have about to cameras each the monitoring of these cameras is done by the cisf which is in charge of the security of the metro as well as the delhi metro rail corporation intercoms are provided in each train car for emergency communication between the passengers and the train operator periodic security drills are carried out at stations and on trains to ensure the preparedness of security agencies in emergency situations dmrc is also looking at raising the station walls and railings for the safety of passengers delhi metro s fares were last revised and went into effect on october based on the recommendation of the th fare fixation committee in may for convenience delhi metro commuters have five choices for ticket purchase these are as the network has expanded high ridership in new trains has led to increasing instances of overcrowding and delays on the delhi metro to alleviate the problem coach trains have been introduced in yellow line and blue line and an increase in the frequency of trains has been proposed infrequent overcrowded and erratic feeder bus services connecting stations to nearby localities have also been reported as an area of concern while the quality and the cleanliness of the delhi metro was lauded the rising cost of fares have been routinely criticized with fares being much more expensive compared to the bus services the metro replaced one recent study has named the fares of the delhi metro as one of the world s most unaffordable among the metros that charge more than us per ride another study finds that delhi metro may also have a low ridership problem compared to its size and may not be generating the amount of traffic a metro system generates dmrc operates around electric feeder buses on routes connecting metro stations in delhi around two hundred thousand people use the feeder bus service on a daily basis timings of feeder bus operation are hours to hours at a frequency of to minutes depending upon road traffic density however if an operator wishes he can operate before beyond these hours at present metro feeder bus depots are located at shastri park kohat enclave janakpuri west dwarka sector chhatarpur yamuna bank azadpur delhi metro had a continuous increase in ridership since its inception up to fy when metro services were introduced in the average ridership was passengers per day in fy average daily ridership rose to lakh million ridership declined in and marginally increased in following fare increases in ridership averaged lakh million per day between may and june the highest number of passengers in a single day was reached on july with lakh million trips on the network in fy the average daily ridership was lakhs million delhi metro was suspended on march due to covid pandemic and operations were restarted on september resulting in a decline in average daily ridership to lakhs million in fy including rapid metro gurgaon source delhi metro has been operating with a loss on an ebt basis since although the loss has reduced after ebitda margin declined from in fiscal to in fiscal before improving to in in delhi metro started a semi naming policy of metro stations awarded through an open e tendering process to generate non fare revenues dmrc is owned equally by the government of national capital territory of delhi and the government of india as of march total debt stood at billion us billion while equity capital was billion us billion the cost of the debt is for union government and delhi government loans and between and for japan international cooperation agency jica loans of the equity capital as of march billion us billion is paid up capital and the rest is reserves and surplus delhi metro currently has operational depots the delhi metro uses the rolling stock of two different gauges phase i lines use ft in mm broad gauge rolling stock while three phase ii lines use mm ft in rolling stock trains are maintained at seven depots at khyber pass and sultanpur for the yellow line mundka for the green line najafgarh and yamuna bank for the blue line shastri park for the red line and sarita vihar for the violet line maglev trains were initially considered for some lines of phase but dmrc decided to continue with conventional rail in august as on march the company has a total of coaches trains apart from extensions on various existing lines two new lines viz lines are proposed in phase iii coaches six car trains being procured for these two new lines will have an advanced feature in unattended train operation uto additional broad gauge bg coaches for lines to and standard gauge sg coaches for lines are proposed to be procured for augmentation extensions to cater to the increased traffic resultantly at the end of phase iii there would be coaches trains barring a few car trains on line of the trains would operate either in car or car configuration at the end of phase iii the rolling stock is manufactured by two major suppliers for phase i the rolling stock was supplied by a consortium of companies comprising hyundai rotem mitsubishi corporation and melco the coaches have a very similar look to mtr rotem emu but there are only doors and sliding doors are used instead of plug doors the coaches were initially built in south korea by rotem then in bangalore by beml

data information for the blue line siemens supplied the electronic interlocking sicas the operation control system vicos oc and the automation control system lzb m an integrated system comprising optical fibre cable on train radio cctv and a centralised clock and public address system is used for telecommunication during train operations as well as emergencies for red and yellow lines alstom has supplied signalling system and for the green and violet lines bombardier transportation supplied its cityflo signalling system the airport express line introduced wifi services at all stations along the route on january connectivity inside metro trains travelling on the route is expected in the future the wifi service is provided by you broadband and cable india limited in august wifi service was launched at all the stations under blue line a fully automated operator less train system has been offered to delhi metro by the french defense and civilian technologies major thales the delhi metro has won awards for environmentally friendly practices from organisations including the united nations rina and the international organization for standardization becoming the second metro in the world after the new york city subway to be iso certified for environmentally friendly construction most of the metro stations on the blue line conduct rainwater harvesting as an environmental protection measure it is also the first railway project in the world to earn carbon credits after being registered with the united nations under the clean development mechanism and has so far earned carbon credits by saving energy through the use of regenerative braking systems on its trains to reduce its dependence on non renewable sources of energy dmrc is looking forward to harnessing solar energy and install solar panels at the karkarduma noida sector anand vihar and pragati maidan metro stations and dmrc s residential complex at pushp vihar as of march the dmrc has commissioned mwp megawatt peak of solar power plants across locations on the metro network this is planned to increase to mwp by march and mwp by the metro has been promoted as an integral part of community infrastructure and community artwork depicting the local way of life has been put on display at stations students of local art colleges have also designed decorative murals at metro stations while pillars of the viaduct on some elevated sections have been decorated with mosaic murals created by local schoolchildren the metro station at ina colony has a gallery showcasing artwork and handicrafts

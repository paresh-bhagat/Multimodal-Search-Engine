more passenger airlines than any other airport in the united states although lax is the busiest airport in the greater los angeles area several other airports including hollywood burbank airport john wayne airport orange county long beach airport ontario international airport and san bernardino international airport serve the region in the los angeles city council and the chamber of commerce recognized the need for the city to have its own airport to tap into the fledgling but quickly growing aviation industry several locations were considered but the final choice was a acre sq mi ha field in the southern part of westchester the location had been promoted by real estate agent william w mines and mines field as it was known had already been selected to host the national air races on august the city leased the land and the newly formed department of airports began converting the fields once used to grow wheat barley and lima beans into dirt landing strips the airport opened on october and the first structure hangar no was erected in the building still stands at the airport remaining in active use and listed on the national register of historic places over the next year the airport started to come together the dirt runway was replaced with an all weather surface and more hangars a restaurant and a control tower were built on june the facility was dedicated and renamed los angeles municipal airport the airport was used by private pilots and flying schools but the city s vision was that los angeles would become the main passenger hub for the area however the airport failed to entice any carriers away from the established burbank airport or the grand central airport in glendale world war ii put a pause on any further development of the airport for passenger use before the united states entered the war the aviation manufacturers located around the airport were busy providing aircraft for the allied powers while the flying schools found themselves in high demand in january the military assumed control of the airport stationing fighter planes at the airfield and building naval gun batteries in the ocean dunes to the west meanwhile airport managers published a master plan for the land and in early and convinced voters to back a million bond for airport improvements with a plan and funding in place the airlines were finally convinced to make the move after the end of the war four temporary terminals were quickly erected on the north side of the airport and on december american airlines trans world airlines twa united airlines southwest airways and western airlines began passenger operations at the airport with pan american airways pan am joining the next month the airport was renamed los angeles international airport in the temporary terminals would remain in place for years but quickly became inadequate especially as air travel entered the jet age and other cities invested in modern facilities airport leaders once again convinced voters to back a million bond on june the current layout of the passenger facilities was established in with a plan to build a series of terminals and parking facilities arranged in the shape of the letter u in the central portion of the property the original plan called for the terminal buildings connected at the center of the property by a huge steel and glass dome the dome was never built but a smaller theme building built in the central area became a focal point for people coming to the airport the first of the new passenger buildings terminals and were opened for united airlines on june following opening festivities that lasted several days terminals and opened later that same year a major expansion of the airport came in the early s ahead of the summer olympic games in november a second level roadway was added terminal opened in january and the tom bradley international terminal opened in june the original terminals also received expansions and updates in the s since the airport has been undergoing another major expansion all of the terminals are being refurbished and the tom bradley international terminal was completely rebuilt with a west gates concourse added outside of the terminal area a stall parking structure a los angeles metro rail station and a consolidated rental car facility are being built all will be connected to the terminal area by the lax automated people mover in the near future airport managers plan to build two more terminals and all together these projects are expected to cost of billion and bring lax s total gates from to before the s us airports used a two letter abbreviation and at that time la served as the designation for los angeles airport with the rapid growth in the aviation industry in the identifiers expanded to three letters and la received an extra letter to become lax the letter x does not otherwise have any specific meaning in this identifier lax is also used for the port of los angeles in san pedro and by amtrak for union station in downtown los angeles r l and l r designated the north airfield complex are north of the airport terminals and r l and l r designated the south airfield complex are south of the airport terminals lax is located with the pacific ocean to the west and residential communities on all other sides since los angeles world airports has adopted a preferential runway use policy to minimize noise levels in the communities closest to lax typically the loudest operations at an airport are from departing aircraft as engines operate at full power so during daytime hours am to midnight lax prefers to operate under the westerly operations air traffic pattern named for the prevailing west winds under westerly operations departing aircraft take off to the west over the ocean and arriving aircraft approach from the east to reduce noise to areas north and south of the airport lax prefers to use the inboard runways r l and l r closest to the central terminal area and further from residential areas for departures and the outboard runways are preferred for arrivals historically over of flights have used the inboard departures and outboard arrivals scheme during nighttime hours when there are fewer aircraft operations and residential areas tend to be more noise sensitive additional changes are made to reduce noise between pm and am air traffic controls try to use the outboard runways as little as possible and between midnight and am the air traffic pattern shifts to over ocean operations where departing aircraft continue to take off to the west but arriving aircraft also approach from the west over the ocean there are times when the over ocean and westerly operations are not possible particularly when the winds originate from the east typically during inclement weather and santa ana winds events when that happens the airport shifts to the non preferred easterly operations air traffic pattern where departing aircraft take off to the east and arriving aircraft approach from the west the south airfield complex tends to see more operations than the north due to a larger number of passenger gates and air cargo operations runways in the north airfield complex are separated by feet m plans have been advanced and approved to increase the separation by feet m which would allow a central taxiway between runways despite opposition from residents living north of lax the separation between the two runways in the south airfield complex has already increased by feet m to accommodate a central taxiway lax has nine passenger terminals with a total of gates arranged in the shape of the letter u or a horseshoe that are identified by numbers except for the tom bradley international terminal the midfield satellite concourse now renamed the west gates an expansion for international flights reached through the tom bradley terminal opened on may there are million square feet m of cargo facilities at lax as well as a heliport operated

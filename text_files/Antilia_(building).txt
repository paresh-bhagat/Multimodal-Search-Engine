high ceilings other buildings of equivalent height may have as many as floors the home was also designed to survive an earthquake of magnitude it is considered by some to be the tallest single family house in the world but others disqualify the antilia because it includes space for a staff of the interior design uses the shapes of the lotus and the sun these two features are repeated throughout the building using crystals marble and mother of pearl however no two floors use the same materials or plan the idea of the design is of consistency but no repetition the building has one helipad however it is not operational the helipads have to be certified air worthy by the director general of civil aviation dgca and have yet to get approval from the central defence and environment ministries the house warming was done in november but ambani did not immediately move in for fear of bad luck in june almost renowned pandits were invited to conduct pujas and address vastu issues in the building after which the ambanis took up residence in september prior to construction the worth of the plot and unbuilt house were estimated to be more than us billion during planning the house was expected to be the world s largest and most expensive home with a cost of about us billion as of update it is considered the world s most expensive private residence on july a fire broke out on the ninth floor and it was extinguished within a few minutes six fire tenders reached the building within minutes of getting the call however the fire was extinguished by antilia staff before the fire brigade team arrived using a small line of fixed firefighting systems and fire extinguishers the fire was confined to the g antenna and plastic framing of the vertical garden on february a car containing explosive gelatin sticks and a threatening letter targeting the ambanis was found near antilia the car was parked about metres from the building on carmichael road bordering altamount road a security officer at antilia placed a call to the police control room regarding the suspicious vehicle and the police rushed to the spot joined by the bomb detection and disposal squad after the sniffer dogs detected explosives the bomb squad removed the gelatin sticks which were found to be not assembled and had no battery or detonator the probe was led by the mumbai s crime intelligence unit head sachin vaze the case was handed to the national investigative agency which found out that vaze was himself involved in this incident and he was arrested tata group former chairman ratan tata said antilia is an example of rich indians lack of empathy for the poor tata said the person who lives in there should be concerned about what he sees around him and asking how he can make a difference if he cannot then it s sad because this country needs people to allocate some of their enormous wealth to finding ways of mitigating the hardship that people have it makes me wonder why someone would do that that s what revolutions are made of

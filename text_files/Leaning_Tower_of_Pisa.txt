 the leaning tower of pisa italian torre pendente di pisa or simply the tower of pisa torre di pisa torre di pi za pi sa is the campanile or freestanding bell tower of pisa cathedral it is known for its nearly four degree lean the result of an unstable foundation the tower is one of three structures in the pisa s cathedral square piazza del duomo which includes the cathedral and pisa baptistry the height of the tower is metres feet inches from the ground on the low side and m ft in on the high side the width of the walls at the base is m ft in its weight is estimated at tonnes short tons the tower has or steps the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north facing staircase the tower began to lean during construction in the th century due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure s weight it worsened through the completion of construction in the th century by the tilt had reached degrees the structure was stabilized by remedial work between and which reduced the tilt to degrees there has been controversy surrounding the identity of the architect of the leaning tower of pisa for many years the design was attributed to guglielmo and bonanno pisano a well known th century resident artist of pisa known for his bronze casting particularly in the pisa duomo citation needed pisano left pisa in for monreale sicily only to come back and die in his home town a piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in but this may be related to the bronze door in the fa ade of the cathedral that was destroyed in a study seems to indicate diotisalvi was the original architect due to the time of construction and affinity with other diotisalvi works notably the bell tower of san nicola and the baptistery both in pisa page needed

construction of the tower occurred in three stages over years on january donna berta di bernardo a widow and resident of the house of dell opera di santa maria bequeathed sixty soldi to the opera campanilis petrarum sancte marie the sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower on august the foundations of the tower were laid work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on august of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity this ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical corinthian capitals citation needed nearly four centuries later giorgio vasari wrote guglielmo according to what is being said in the year together with sculptor bonanno laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in pisa the tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in this was due to a mere three metre foundation set in weak unstable subsoil a design that was flawed from the beginning construction was subsequently halted for almost a century as the republic of pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with genoa lucca and florence this allowed time for the underlying soil to settle otherwise the tower would almost certainly have toppled on december the worker benenato son of gerardo bottici oversaw the continuation of the tower s construction on february guido speziale son of giovanni pisano was elected to oversee the building of the tower on april the master builder giovanni di simone architect of the camposanto and workers went to the mountains close to pisa to cut marble the cut stones were given to rainaldo speziale worker of st francesco in construction resumed under di simone in an effort to compensate for the tilt the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other because of this the tower is curved construction was halted again in when the pisans were defeated by the genoese in the battle of meloria the seventh floor was completed in the bell chamber was finally added in it was built by tommaso di andrea pisano who succeeded in harmonizing the gothic elements of the belfry with the romanesque style of the tower there are seven bells one for each note of the musical major scale the largest one was installed in between and galileo galilei who lived in pisa at the time is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass in keeping with the law of free fall the primary source for this is the biography racconto istorico della vita di galileo galilei historical account of the life of galileo galilei written by galileo s pupil and secretary vincenzo viviani in but only published in long after his death during world war ii the allies suspected that the germans were using the tower as an observation post leon weckstein a u s army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of german troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike sparing it from destruction page needed numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over most of these efforts failed some worsened the tilt on february the government of italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling it was however considered important to retain the current tilt due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of pisa starting in tonnes of lead counterweights were added which straightened the tower slightly the tower and the neighbouring cathedral baptistery and cemetery are included in the piazza del duomo unesco world heritage site which was declared in the tower was closed to the public on january after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the civic tower of pavia in the bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety the selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by removing cubic metres cubic feet of soil from underneath the raised end the tower s tilt was reduced by centimetres inches returning to its position after a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts the tower was reopened to the public on december and was declared stable for at least another years in total metric tons short tons of soil were removed after a phase of structural strengthening the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage mostly corrosion and blackening these are particularly pronounced due to the tower s age and its exposure to wind and rain in may engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history they stated that it would be stable for at least years leaning tower of pisa in the s plaque in memory of galileo galilei s experiments temporary lead counterweights the baptistery in the foreground the cathedral in the middleground and the leaning tower of pisa in the background at least four strong earthquakes have hit the region since but the apparently vulnerable tower survived the reason was not understood until a research group of engineers investigated the researchers concluded that the tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil structure interaction dssi the height and stiffness of the tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion the same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive about the th bell the name pasquareccia comes from easter because it used to ring on easter day however this bell is older than the bell chamber itself and comes from the tower vergata in palazzo pretorio in pisa where it was called la giustizia the justice the bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors including count ugolino in a new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the th century to replace the broken pasquareccia citation needed the circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction this belfry incorporates a cm in correction for the inclined axis below the siting of the campanile within the piazza del duomo diverges from the axial alignment of the cathedral and baptistery of the piazza del duomo citation needed two german churches have challenged the tower s status as the world s most lopsided building the th century square leaning tower of suurhusen and the th century bell tower in the town of bad frankenhausen guinness world records measured the pisa and suurhusen towers finding the former s tilt to be degrees in june guinness world records certified the capital gate building in abu dhabi uae as the world s furthest leaning man made tower it has an degree slope almost five times more than the tower of pisa but was deliberately engineered to slant the leaning tower of wanaka in new zealand also deliberately built leans at degrees to the ground view looking up entrance door to

 neuschwanstein castle german schloss neuschwanstein pronounced l s n va n ta n southern bavarian schloss neischwanstoa is a th century historicist palace on a rugged hill above the village of hohenschwangau near f ssen in southwest bavaria germany the palace was commissioned by king ludwig ii of bavaria as a retreat and in honour of richard wagner ludwig chose to pay for the palace out of his personal fortune and by means of extensive borrowing rather than bavarian public funds construction began in but was never fully completed the castle was intended as a private residence for the king until he died in it was open to the public shortly after his death since then more than million people have visited neuschwanstein castle more than million people visit annually with as many as per day in the summer the municipality of schwangau lies at an elevation of m ft at the southwest border of the german state of bavaria its surroundings are characterised by the transition between the alpine foothills in the south toward the nearby austrian border and a hilly landscape in the north that appears flat by comparison in the middle ages three castles overlooked the villages one was called schwanstein castle nb in ludwig s father king maximilian ii of bavaria bought its ruins to replace them with the comfortable neo gothic palace known as hohenschwangau castle finished in the palace became his family s summer residence and his elder son ludwig born spent a large part of his childhood here vorderhohenschwangau castle and hinterhohenschwangau castle nb sat on a rugged hill overlooking schwanstein castle two nearby lakes alpsee and schwansee and the village separated by only a moat they jointly consisted of a hall a keep and a fortified tower house in the nineteenth century only ruins remained of the twin medieval castles but those of hinterhohenschwangau served as a lookout place known as sylphenturm the ruins above the family palace were known to the crown prince from his excursions he first sketched one of them in his diary in when the young king came to power in the construction of a new palace in place of the two ruined castles became the first in his series of palace building projects ludwig called the new palace new hohenschwangau castle only after his death was it renamed neuschwanstein the confusing result is that hohenschwangau and schwanstein have effectively swapped names hohenschwangau castle replaced the ruins of schwanstein castle and neuschwanstein castle replaced the ruins of the two hohenschwangau castles neuschwanstein embodies both the contemporaneous architectural fashion known as castle romanticism german burgenromantik and king ludwig ii s enthusiasm for the operas of richard wagner in the th century many castles were constructed or reconstructed often with significant changes to make them more picturesque palace building projects similar to neuschwanstein had been undertaken earlier in several of the german states and included hohenschwangau castle lichtenstein castle hohenzollern castle and numerous buildings on the river rhine such as stolzenfels castle the inspiration for the construction of neuschwanstein came from two journeys that ludwig took in one in may to the reconstructed wartburg near eisenach another in july to the ch teau de pierrefonds which eug ne viollet le duc was transforming from a ruined castle into a historistic palace nb the king saw both buildings as representatives of a romantic interpretation of the middle ages as well as the musical mythology of his friend wagner whose operas tannh user and lohengrin had made a lasting impression on him in february ludwig s grandfather king ludwig i died freeing the considerable sums that were previously spent on the abdicated king s appanage nb this allowed ludwig ii to start the architectural project of building a private refuge in the familiar landscape far from the capital munich so that he could live out his idea of the middle ages it is my intention to rebuild the old castle ruin of hohenschwangau near the p llat gorge in the authentic style of the old german knights castles and i must confess to you that i am looking forward very much to living there one day you know the revered guest i would like to accommodate there the location is one of the most beautiful to be found holy and unapproachable a worthy temple for the divine friend who has brought salvation and true blessing to the world it will also remind you of tannh user singers hall with a view of the castle in the background lohengrin castle courtyard open corridor path to the chapel the building design was drafted by the stage designer christian jank and realised by the architect eduard riedel for technical reasons the ruined castles could not be integrated into the plan initial ideas for the palace drew stylistically on nuremberg castle and envisaged a simple building in place of the old vorderhohenschwangau castle but they were rejected and replaced by increasingly extensive drafts culminating in a bigger palace modelled on the wartburg the king insisted on a detailed plan and on personal approval of each and every draft ludwig s control went so far that the palace has been regarded as his own creation rather than that of the architects involved whereas contemporary architecture critics derided neuschwanstein one of the last big palace building projects of the nineteenth century as kitsch neuschwanstein and ludwig ii s other buildings are now counted among the major works of european historicism for financial reasons a project similar to neuschwanstein falkenstein castle never left the planning stages the palace can be regarded as typical for nineteenth century architecture the shapes of romanesque simple geometric figures such as cuboids and semicircular arches gothic upward pointing lines slim towers delicate embellishments and byzantine architecture and art the throne hall d cor were mingled in an eclectic fashion and supplemented with th century technical achievements the patrona bavariae and saint george on the court face of the palas main building are depicted in the local l ftlmalerei style a fresco technique typical for allg u farmers houses while the unimplemented drafts for the knights house gallery foreshadow elements of art nouveau characteristic of neuschwanstein s design are theatre themes christian jank drew on coulisse drafts from his time as a scenic painter the basic style was originally planned to be neo gothic but the palace was primarily built in romanesque style in the end the operatic themes moved gradually from tannh user and lohengrin to parsifal in the ruins of the medieval twin castles were completely demolished the remains of the old keep were blown up the foundation stone for the palace was laid on september in its cellar was completed and in everything up to the first floor the gatehouse being finished first at the end of it was completed and fully furnished allowing ludwig to take provisional lodgings there and observe the ongoing construction work in management of the civil works passed from eduard riedel to georg von dollmann the topping out ceremony for the palas was in and in the king was able to move in to the new building in the same year the direction of the project passed to julius hofmann after dollmann had fallen from the king s favour the palace was erected as a conventional brick construction and later encased in various types of rock the white limestone used for the fronts came from a nearby quarry the sandstone bricks for the portals and bay windows came from schlaitdorf in w rttemberg marble from untersberg near salzburg was used for the windows the arch ribs the columns and the capitals the throne hall was a later addition to the plans and required a steel framework the transport of building materials was facilitated by scaffolding and a steam crane that lifted the material to the construction site another crane was used at the construction site the recently founded dampfkessel revisionsverein steam boiler inspection association regularly inspected both boilers for about two decades the construction site was the principal employer in the region in about craftsmen were occupied at the site not counting suppliers and other persons indirectly involved in the construction at times when the king insisted on particularly close deadlines and urgent changes reportedly up to workers per day were active sometimes working at night by the light of oil lamps statistics from the years support an immense amount of building materials tonnes short tons of salzburg marble t short tons of sandstone bricks and cubic metres cu yd of wood for the scaffolding in a society was founded for insuring the workers for a low monthly fee augmented by the king the heirs of construction casualties cases are mentioned in the statistics received a small pension in the king was able to move into the still unfinished palas and in he invited his mother marie to neuschwanstein on the occasion of her th birthday nb by the external structure of the palas hall was mostly finished in the same year ludwig had the first wooden marienbr cke over the p llat gorge replaced by a steel construction despite its size neuschwanstein did not have space for the royal court but contained only the king s private lodging and servants rooms the court buildings served decorative rather than residential purposes the palace was intended to serve king ludwig ii as a kind of inhabitable theatrical setting as a temple of friendship it was also dedicated to the life and work of richard wagner who died in before he had set foot in the building in the end ludwig ii lived in the palace for a total of only days the king s wishes and demands expanded during the construction of neuschwanstein and so did the expenses drafts and estimated costs were revised repeatedly initially a modest study was planned instead of the great throne hall and projected guest rooms were struck from the drafts to make place for a moorish hall which could not be realised due to lack of resources completion was originally projected for but repeatedly deferred neuschwanstein the symbolic medieval knight s castle was not king ludwig ii s only huge construction project it was followed by the rococo style lustschloss of linderhof palace and the baroque palace of herrenchiemsee a monument to the era of absolutism linderhof the smallest of the projects was finished in and the other two remain incomplete all three projects together drained his resources the king paid for his construction projects by private means and from his civil list income contrary to frequent claims the bavarian treasury was not directly burdened by his buildings from ludwig had an additional secret income in return for a political favour given to otto von bismarck nb the construction costs of neuschwanstein in the king s lifetime amounted to million marks equivalent to million almost twice the initial cost estimate of million marks as his private means were insufficient for his increasingly escalating construction projects the king continuously opened new lines of credit in a court counselor was replaced after pointing out the danger of insolvency by he already owed million marks and in spring and august debt conversions of million marks and million marks respectively became necessary even after his debts had reached million marks king ludwig ii insisted on continuation of his architectural projects he threatened suicide if his creditors seized his palaces in early ludwig asked his cabinet for a credit of million marks which was denied in april he followed bismarck s advice to apply for the money to his parliament in june the bavarian government decided to depose the king who was living at neuschwanstein at the time on june he was incapacitated and on june he had the deposition commission arrested in the gatehouse in expectation of the commission he alerted the gendarmerie and fire brigades of surrounding places for his protection a second commission headed by bernhard von gudden arrived on the next day and the king was forced to leave the palace that night ludwig was put under the supervision of von gudden on june both died under mysterious circumstances in the shallow shore water of lake starnberg near berg castle at the time of king ludwig s death the palace was far from complete the external structures of the gatehouse and the palas were mostly finished but the rectangular tower was still scaffolded work on the bower had not started but was completed in a simplified form by without the planned figures of the female saints the knights house was also simplified in king ludwig s plans the columns in the knights house gallery were held as tree trunks and the capitals as the corresponding crowns only the foundations existed for the core piece of the palace complex a keep of metres ft height planned in the upper courtyard resting on a three nave chapel this was not realised and a connection wing between the gatehouse and the bower saw the same fate plans for a castle garden with terraces and a fountain west of the palas were also abandoned after the king s death the interior of the royal living space in the palace was mostly completed in the lobbies and corridors were painted in a simpler style by the moorish hall desired by the king and planned below the throne hall was not realised any more than the so called knights bath which modelled after the knights bath in the wartburg was intended to render homage to the knights cult as a medieval baptism bath a bride chamber in the bower after a location in lohengrin guest rooms in the first and second floor of the palas and a great banquet hall were further abandoned projects in fact a complete development of neuschwanstein had never even been planned and at the time of the king s death there was not a utilisation concept for numerous rooms neuschwanstein was still incomplete when ludwig ii died in the king never intended to make the palace accessible to the public no more than six weeks after the king s death however the prince regent luitpold ordered the palace opened to paying visitors the administrators of king ludwig s estate managed to balance the construction debts by from then until world war i neuschwanstein was a stable and lucrative source of revenue for the house of wittelsbach indeed king ludwig s castles were probably the single largest income source earned by the bavarian royal family in the last years prior to to guarantee a smooth course of visits some rooms and the court buildings were finished first initially the visitors were allowed to move freely in the palace causing the furniture to wear quickly when bavaria became a republic in the government socialised the civil list the resulting dispute with the house of wittelsbach led to a split in king ludwig s palaces including neuschwanstein fell to the state and are now managed by the bavarian palace department a division of the bavarian finance ministry nearby hohenschwangau castle fell to the wittelsbacher ausgleichsfonds whose revenues go to the house of wittelsbach the visitor numbers continued to rise reaching in due to its secluded and strategically unimportant location the palace survived the destruction of two world wars until it served as a depot for nazi plunder that was taken from france by the reichsleiter rosenberg institute for the occupied territories einsatzstab reichsleiter rosenberg f r die besetzten gebiete a suborganisation of the nazi party the castle was used to catalogue the works of arts after world war ii photo albums were found in the palace documenting the scale of the art seizures the albums are now stored in the united states national archives in april the ss considered blowing up the palace to prevent the building itself and the artwork it contained from falling to the enemy the plan was not realised by the ss gruppenf hrer who had been assigned the task however and at the end of the war the palace was surrendered undamaged to representatives of the allied forces the allied occupation authorities eventually returned the palace to the reconstituted bavarian state government thereafter the bavarian archives used some of the rooms as a provisional store for salvaged archival material as the premises in munich had been bombed the effect of the neuschwanstein ensemble is highly stylistic both externally and internally the king s influence is apparent throughout and he took a keen personal interest in the design and decoration an example can be seen in his comments or commands regarding a mural depicting lohengrin in the palas his majesty wishes that the ship be placed further from the shore that lohengrin s neck be less tilted that the chain from the ship to the swan be of gold and not of roses and finally that the style of the castle shall be kept medieval the suite of rooms within the palas contains the throne room king ludwig s suite the singers hall and the grotto the interior and especially the throne room byzantine arab construction resumes to the chapels and churches of the royal sicilian norman swabian period in palermo related to the kings of germany house of hohenstaufen throughout the design pays homage to the german legends of lohengrin the swan knight hohenschwangau where king ludwig spent much of his youth had decorations of these sagas these themes were taken up in the operas of richard wagner many rooms bear a border depicting the various operas written by wagner including a theatre permanently featuring the set of one such play many of the interior rooms remain undecorated with only rooms finished before ludwig s death with the palace under construction at the king s death one of the major features of the palace remained unbuilt a massive keep which would have formed the highest point and central focus of the ensemble was planned for the middle of the upper courtyard but was never built at the decision of the king s family the foundation for the keep is visible in the upper courtyard neuschwanstein castle consists of several individual structures which were erected over a length of metres on the top of a cliff ridge the elongate building is furnished with numerous towers ornamental turrets gables balconies pinnacles and sculptures following romanesque style most window openings are fashioned as bi and triforia before the backdrop of the tegelberg and the p llat gorge in the south and the alpine foothills with their lakes in the north the ensemble of individual buildings provides varying picturesque views of the palace from all directions it was designed as the romantic ideal of a knight s castle unlike real castles whose building stock is in most cases the result of centuries of building activity neuschwanstein was planned from the inception as an intentionally asymmetric building and erected in consecutive stages typical attributes of a castle were included but real fortifications the most important feature of a medieval aristocratic estate were dispensed with the palace complex is entered through the symmetrical gatehouse flanked by two stair towers the eastward pointing gate building is the only structure of the palace whose wall area is fashioned in high contrast colours the exterior walls are cased with red bricks the court fronts with yellow limestone the roof cornice is surrounded by pinnacles the upper floor of the gatehouse is surmounted by a crow stepped gable and held king ludwig ii s first lodging at neuschwanstein from which he occasionally observed the building work before the hall was completed the ground floors of the gatehouse were intended to accommodate the stables the passage through the gatehouse crowned with the royal bavarian coat of arms leads directly into the courtyard the courtyard has two levels the lower one being defined to the east by the gatehouse and to the north by the foundations of the so called rectangular tower and by the gallery building the southern end of the courtyard is open imparting a view of the surrounding mountain scenery at its western end the courtyard is delimited by a bricked embankment whose polygonally protracting bulge marks the choir of the originally projected chapel this three nave church never built was intended to form the base of a metre ft keep the planned centrepiece of the architectural ensemble a flight of steps at the side gives access to the upper level today the foundation plan of the chapel keep is marked out in the upper courtyard pavement the most striking structure of the upper court level is the so called rectangular tower metres or feet like most of the court buildings it mostly serves a decorative purpose as part of the ensemble its viewing platform provides a vast view over the alpine foothills to the north the northern end of the upper courtyard is defined by the so called knights house the three storey building is connected to the rectangular tower and the gatehouse by means of a continuous gallery fashioned with a blind arcade from the point of view of castle romanticism the knights house was the abode of a stronghold s menfolk at neuschwanstein estate and service rooms were envisioned here the bower which complements the knights house as the ladies house but was never used as such defines the south side of the courtyard both structures together form the motif of the antwerp castle featuring in the first act of lohengrin embedded in the pavement is the floor plan of the planned palace chapel the western end of the courtyard is delimited by the palas hall it constitutes the real main and residential building of the castle and contains the king s stateroom and the servants rooms the palas is a colossal five story structure in the shape of two huge cuboids that are connected in a flat angle and covered by two adjacent high gable roofs the building s shape follows the course of the ridge in its angles there are two stair towers the northern one surmounting the palace roof by several storeys with its height of metres ft with their polymorphic roofs both towers are reminiscent of the ch teau de pierrefonds the western palas front supports a two storey balcony with view on the alpsee while northwards a low chair tower and the conservatory protract from the main structure the entire palas is spangled with numerous decorative chimneys and ornamental turrets the court front with colourful frescos the court side gable is crowned with a copper lion the western outward gable with the likeness of a knight had it been completed the palace would have had more than interior rooms including premises for guests and servants as well as for service and logistics ultimately no more than about rooms and halls were finished in its lower stories the palas accommodates administrative and servants rooms and the rooms of today s palace administration the king s staterooms are situated in the upper stories the anterior structure accommodates the lodgings in the third floor above them the hall of the singers the upper floors of the west facing posterior structure are filled almost completely by the throne hall the total floor space of all floors amounts to nearly square metres sq ft neuschwanstein houses numerous significant interior rooms of german historicism the palace was fitted with several of the latest technical innovations of the late th century among other things it had a battery powered bell system for the servants and telephone lines the kitchen equipment included a rumford oven that turned the skewer with its heat and so automatically adjusted the turning speed the hot air was used for a calorif re central heating system further novelties for the era were running warm water and toilets with automatic flushing the largest room of the palace by area is the hall of the singers followed by the throne hall the by metre by ft hall of the singers is located in the eastern court side wing of the palas in the fourth floor above the king s lodgings it is designed as an amalgamation of two rooms of the wartburg the hall of the singers and the ballroom it was one of the king s favourite projects for his palace the rectangular room was decorated with themes from lohengrin and parzival its longer side is terminated by a gallery that is crowned by a tribune modelled after the wartburg the eastern narrow side is terminated by a stage that is structured by arcades and known as the s ngerlaube the hall of the singers was never designed for court festivities of the reclusive king citation needed rather like the throne hall it served as a walkable monument in which the culture of knights and courtly love of the middle ages was represented the first performance in this hall took place in a concert commemorating the th anniversary of richard wagner s death the throne hall by metres by ft is situated in the west wing of the palas with its height of metres ft it occupies the third and fourth floors julius hofmann modelled it after the allerheiligen hofkirche in the munich residenz on three sides it is surrounded by colorful arcades ending in an apse that was intended to hold king ludwig s throne which was never completed the throne dais is surrounded by paintings of jesus the twelve apostles and six canonised kings the mural paintings were created by wilhelm hauschild the floor mosaic was completed after the king s death the chandelier is fashioned after a byzantine crown the throne hall makes a sacral impression following the king s wish it amalgamated the grail hall from parzival with a symbol of the divine right of kings an incorporation of unrestricted sovereign power which king ludwig as the head of a constitutional monarchy no longer held the union of the sacral and regal is emphasised by the portraits in the apse of six canonised kings saint louis of france saint stephen of hungary saint edward the confessor of england saint wenceslaus of bohemia saint olaf of norway and saint henry holy roman emperor hall of the singers throne hall drawing room study dining room bedroom apart from the large ceremonial rooms several smaller rooms were created for use by king ludwig ii the royal lodging is on the third floor of the palace in the east wing of the palas it consists of eight rooms with living space and several smaller rooms in spite of the gaudy d cor the living space with its moderate room size and its sofas and suites makes a relatively modern impression on today s visitors king ludwig ii did not attach importance to representative requirements of former times in which the life of a monarch was mostly public the interior decoration with mural paintings tapestry furniture and other handicraft generally refers to the king s favourite themes the grail legend the works of wolfram von eschenbach and their interpretation by richard wagner the eastward drawing room is adorned with themes from the lohengrin legend the furniture sofa table armchairs and seats in a northward alcove is comfortable and homelike next to the drawing room is a little artificial grotto that forms the passage to the study the unusual room originally equipped with an artificial waterfall and a so called rainbow machine is connected to a little conservatory depicting the h rselberg grotto it relates to wagner s tannh user as does the d cor of the adjacent study in the park of linderhof palace the king had installed a similar grotto of greater dimensions opposite the study follows the dining room adorned with themes of courtly love since the kitchen in neuschwanstein is situated three stories below the dining room it was impossible to install a wishing table dining table disappearing by means of a mechanism as at linderhof palace and herrenchiemsee instead the dining room was connected with the kitchen by means of a service lift the bedroom adjacent to the dining room and the subsequent house chapel are the only rooms of the palace that remain in neo gothic style the king s bedroom is dominated by a huge bed adorned with carvings fourteen carvers worked more than four years on the bed canopy with its numerous pinnacles and on the oaken panellings it was in this room that ludwig was arrested on the night of the june the adjacent little house chapel is consecrated to saint louis after whom the owner was named the servants rooms in the basement of the palas are quite scantily equipped with massive oak furniture besides one table and one cabinet there are two beds of metres ft in length each opaque glass windows separated the rooms from the corridor that connects the exterior stairs with the main stairs so that the king could enter and leave unseen the servants were not allowed to use the main stairs but were restricted to the much narrower and steeper servants stairs neuschwanstein welcomes almost million visitors per year making it one of the most popular tourist destinations in europe for security reasons the palace can only be visited via a minute guided tour and no photography is allowed inside the castle there are also special guided tours that focus on specific topics in the peak season from june until august neuschwanstein has as many as visitors per day and guests without advance reservation may have to wait several hours those without tickets may still walk the long driveway from the base to the top of the mountain and visit the grounds and courtyard without a ticket but they will not be admitted to the interior of the castle ticket sales are processed exclusively via the ticket centre in hohenschwangau as of update the total number of visitors exceeded million in the revenues were booked as million neuschwanstein is a global symbol of the era of romanticism the palace has appeared prominently in several movies such as helmut k utner s ludwig ii and luchino visconti s ludwig both biopics about the king the musical chitty chitty bang bang the spoof comedy spaceballs and the war drama the great escape it served as the inspiration for disneyland s sleeping beauty castle cameran palace in the animated pok mon film lucario and the mystery of mew and later similar structures it is also visited by the character grace nakimura alongside herrenchiemsee in the game the beast within a gabriel knight mystery in neuschwanstein castle became the motif of a west german definitive stamp and it appeared on a commemorative coin for the german bundesl nder series in in it was a finalist in the widely publicised online selection of the new seven wonders of the world a meteorite that reached earth spectacularly on april at the austrian border near hohenschwangau was named neuschwanstein after the palace three fragments were found neuschwanstein i kg lb found july and neuschwanstein ii kg lb found may on the german side and neuschwanstein iii kg lb found june on the austrian side near reutte the meteorite is classified as an enstatite chondrite with unusually large proportions of pure iron enstatite and the extremely rare mineral sinoite si n o as of update neuschwanstein and ludwig s linderhof and herrenchiemsee palaces are on the german tentative list for a future designation as unesco world heritage sites a joint candidature with other representative palaces of the romantic historicism is discussed including schwerin palace for example

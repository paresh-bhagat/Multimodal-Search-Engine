 the petronas towers also known as the petronas twin towers or klcc twin towers malay menara berkembar petronas are storey supertall skyscrapers in kuala lumpur malaysia standing at metres feet from to they were officially designated as the tallest buildings in the world until they were surpassed by the completion of the taipei the petronas towers are the world s tallest twin skyscrapers and remained as the tallest buildings in malaysia until when they were surpassed by the merdeka the petronas towers are a major landmark of kuala lumpur along with the nearby kuala lumpur tower and merdeka and are visible in many places across the city the petronas towers structural system is a tube in tube design invented by architect fazlur rahman khan applying a tube structure for extreme tall buildings is a common phenomenon the floor towers are constructed largely of reinforced concrete with a steel and glass facade designed to resemble motifs found in islamic art a reflection of malaysia s muslim religion another islamic influence on the design is that the cross section of the towers is based on a rub el hizb albeit with circular sectors added to meet office space requirements the circular sectors are similar to the bottom part of the qutub minar the towers were designed by argentine american architect c sar pelli a distinctive postmodern style was chosen to create a st century icon for kuala lumpur malaysia planning on the petronas towers started on january and included rigorous tests and simulations of wind and structural loads on the design seven years of construction followed at the former site of the original selangor turf club beginning on march with excavation which involved moving truckloads of earth every night to dig down metres ft below the surface the construction of the superstructure commenced on april interiors with furniture were completed on january the spires of tower and tower were completed on march years after its construction was started and the first batch of petronas personnel moved into the building on january the building was officially opened by the prime minister of malaysia tun dr mahathir bin mohamad on august the twin towers were built on the site of kuala lumpur s race track it was the tallest structure in malaysia at the time of its completion test boreholes found that the original construction site effectively sat on the edge of a cliff one half of the site was decayed limestone while the other half was soft rock the entire site was moved metres ft to allow the buildings to sit entirely on the soft rock because of the depth of the bedrock the buildings were built on the world s deepest foundations concrete piles ranging from to metres to ft deep were bored into the ground the concrete raft foundation comprising cubic metres cu ft of concrete was continuously poured through a period of hours for each tower the raft is metres ft thick weighs tonnes tons and held the world record for the largest concrete pour until the foundations were completed within months by bachy soletanche and required massive amounts of concrete as a result of the malaysian government specifying that the buildings be completed in six years two construction consortia were hired to meet the deadline one for each tower tower the west tower left in the top right photograph was built by a japanese consortium led by the hazama corporation ja jones construction co mmc engineering services sdn bhd ho hup construction co bhd and mitsubishi corp while tower the east tower right in the top right photograph was built by a south korean consortium led by the samsung c t corporation kukdong engineering construction and syarikat jasatera sdn bhd early into construction a batch of concrete failed a routine strength test causing construction to come to a complete halt all the completed floors were tested but it was found that only one had used a bad batch and it was demolished as a result of the concrete failure each new batch was tested before being poured the halt in construction had cost us per day and led to three separate concrete plants being set up on the site to ensure that if one produced a bad batch the other two could continue to supply concrete the sky bridge contract was completed by kukdong engineering construction tower samsung c t became the first to reach the world s tallest building at the time due to the huge cost of importing steel the towers were constructed on a cheaper radical design of super high strength reinforced concrete high strength concrete is a material familiar to asian contractors and twice as effective as steel in sway reduction however it makes the building twice as heavy on its foundation as a comparable steel building supported by by metre concrete cores and an outer ring of widely spaced super columns the towers use a sophisticated structural system that accommodates its slender profile and provides square metres of column free office space below the twin towers is suria klcc a shopping mall and petronas philharmonic hall the home of the malaysian philharmonic orchestra tower one is fully occupied by petronas and a number of its subsidiaries and associate companies while the office spaces in tower two are mostly available for lease to other companies a number of companies have offices in tower two including sapuraomv

as one of the largest shopping malls in malaysia the petronas philharmonic hall also built at the base of the towers is frequently associated with suria klcc s floorspace during holidays or celebration days suria klcc is the top spot to see the beautiful decorations especially at the main entrances and also in centre court it also promotes the uniqueness and beauty of malaysia s cultural

suria klcc spanning acres ha below the building is the klcc park with jogging and walking paths a fountain with incorporated light show wading pools and a children s playground the towers feature a double decker skybridge connecting the two towers on the st and nd floors which is the highest story bridge in the world it is not attached to the main structure but is instead designed to slide in and out of the towers to prevent it from breaking as the towers sway several feet specify in towards and away from each other during high winds it also provides some structural support to the towers in these occasions the bridge is m ft above the ground and m ft long weighing tons the same floor is also known as the podium since visitors going to higher levels have to change elevators here dynamic analyses were performed and iterated to support the final design by studying the structural behavior of the twin towers to time varying loads such as earthquakes and wind the skybridge is open to all visitors but tickets are limited to about people per day and must be obtained on a first come first served basis initially the visit was free but in the tickets started being sold by petronas visitors can choose to opt for package one which is just a visit to the skybridge or go for package two to go to the skybridge and all the way to level visitors are only allowed on the st floor as the nd floor can only be used by the tenants of the building the skybridge also acts as a safety device so that in the event of a fire or other emergency in one tower tenants can evacuate by crossing the skybridge to the other tower the total evacuation triggered by a bomb hoax on september the day after the september attacks destroyed the twin towers of the world trade center in new york city showed that the bridge would not be useful if both towers need to be emptied simultaneously as the capacity of the staircases was insufficient for such an event plans thus call for the lifts to be used if both towers need to be evacuated and a successful drill following the revised plan was conducted in there is a two hinged arch that supports the skybridge with arch legs each metres ft long that are bolted to level of each of the towers after being constructed on the ground the skybridge was lifted into place on the towers over a period of three days in july instead of being directly connected to the towers the skybridge can shift or slide in and out of them to counterbalance any effect from the wind residing on the st and nd floors the skybridge connects a conference room an executive dining room and a prayer room a skybridge connects the two towers an inside view of the skybridge view to the northwest from the petronas towers skybridge including the shadow of tower and the skybridge and the public bank berhad building the main bank of lifts is located in the centre of each tower all main lifts are double decker with the lower deck of the lift taking passengers to even numbered floors and upper deck to odd numbered floors to reach an odd numbered floor from ground level passengers must take an escalator to the upper deck of the lift there are double deck passenger elevators but there are different sets that service certain floors of the towers specifically two sets of six of these double deck passenger elevators to floors and respectively another set of passenger lifts transport passengers to the st and nd floors where they can switch lifts to reach the upper zones of the buildings each double deck passenger lift with the capacity of passengers or passengers per deck there are also heavy duty elevators for utility the lift operating chart of the petronas towers the service building is to the east of the petronas towers and contains the chiller plant system and the cooling towers to keep the petronas towers cool and comfortable in order to visit the petronas towers visitors must first purchase tickets tickets can be purchased online or at the counter discounted tickets for seniors are available for those years of age and above queues for tickets can get quite long sometimes the complete ticketing system is provided by the malaysian based longbow

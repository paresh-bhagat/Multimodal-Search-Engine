of the national football league nfl and atlanta united fc of major league soccer mls the stadium is owned by the state government of georgia through the georgia world congress center authority and operated by amb group the parent organization of the falcons and atlanta united in june the total cost of its construction was estimated at us billion the stadium officially opened on august with a falcons preseason game against the arizona cardinals despite the retractable roof system being incomplete at the time several events formerly held at the georgia dome moved to mercedes benz stadium following its completion including the sec football championship game and the peach bowl in it hosted the college football playoff national championship and the mls cup as atlanta united held home field advantage and it hosted super bowl liii in the stadium s signature feature is its retractable roof which features a pinwheel consisting of eight translucent triangular panels each of the eight panels operates on two straight parallel rails one rail is responsible for moving the panel while the other rail stabilizes the panel closing the roof takes slightly less time than opening the roof since the roof has to disengage the seals at the start of the opening procedure and slow down towards the end to prevent the panels from getting derailed when opened the panels are designed to create the illusion of a bird s wings extended architect bill johnson explained that the circular opening in the roof was inspired by the roman pantheon pantheon was also the working name for the building design the roof was designed to be made of a clear lightweight polymer material that can adjust its opacity to control light and much of the exterior is clear polymer or glass to allow views to the outside the middle concourse and upper bowl were eliminated in the east end zone to allow for an unobstructed view of the atlanta skyline below the roof is the halo an by foot by m ring shaped video board around its rim covering a total area of square feet m it was described by manufacturer daktronics as being three times as large as the current largest single display board in the nfl installed at everbank field in jacksonville also built by daktronics daktronics also installed more than square feet m of other led boards including field level advertising boards for soccer games the stadium s roof can be kept open under light precipitation as the electrical systems for all video boards in the stadium are outdoor rated and the field has a drainage system amb group senior executive mike egan went as far as describing mercedes benz stadium as an outdoor stadium with a roof over it due to these characteristics but that other factors such as humidity and outside temperatures would be taken into consideration on whether or not the roof would be opened the stadium also includes features specific for college football use it opened with two oversized locker rooms each capable of housing players reflecting the much larger size of college football rosters compared to those of the nfl however the stadium did not initially include another feature important in that context staircases connecting the seats to the field making it difficult for bands to enter the field for halftime shows most nfl teams including the falcons do not have bands it also has a soccer specific configuration with retractable lower bowl seats to widen the field and mechanized curtains that limit the capacity to about the stadium incorporates contemporary art into its interior and exterior design with over commissioned works including pieces by nari ward hank willis thomas and steven and william ladd the centerpiece of the art collection is g bor mikl s sz ke s stainless steel sculpture the atlanta falcon which the artist said is the largest freestanding bird sculpture in the world the falcon perched atop a foot m tall bronze football is feet m high with a wingspan of feet m the sculpture stands in front of the stadium weighs over pounds kg and is as tall as a four story building the upper concourse includes an area known as the yard club a concession and gathering area that stretches the length of the football field other noted areas include the at t perch a gathering area with televisions and video walls airing other games designed as being of interest to fantasy football players and the budweiser biergarten several neighborhood bars also operate within the stadium the former georgia dome site between the stadium and the georgia world congress center was redeveloped as the home depot backyard an acre ha green space used as a tailgating area it also features a tier dual level shaded deck pavilion for its concessions mercedes benz stadium focused primarily on the quality and speed of service variety and pricing the stadium includes at least points of sale and has a policy of fan first pricing for all concessions with lower menu prices in comparison to other sports facilities during all events regardless of stature such as a us beverage cup with free refills and a beer to increase the speed of service all items were priced at whole dollars only with the sales tax already included in the posted menu prices rather than added at the time of purchase the practice helped to increase the venue s revenue as the lower prices have been offset by increased spending on concessions by attendees in march following a trial in the stadium became one of the first major professional sports venues in the united states to only accept cashless payment methods for transactions at concessions inside the stadium such as credit or debit cards and mobile payments this only applies to concessions cash is still accepted for ticket sales and any third party merchandising that may operate during events and kiosks are provided for loading cash onto prepaid debit cards with no transaction fees charged at the same time the stadium raised all menu prices by adding tax at the time of purchase but maintaining the same posted price values as before besides five items such as hot dogs whose list prices were discounted by cents to reflect local culture the stadium also partnered with atlanta based restaurants chains and chefs to have presences as concessions under the best of atlanta banner including chick fil a the varsity kevin gillespie and others in keeping with the fan first pricing policy these partners agreed to not mark up their prices in comparison to their standalone locations as with all other locations under a long standing corporate policy the chick fil a does not operate on sundays with no exception even though the stadium s main tenant primarily plays on sundays during sunday events the chick fil a stand is replaced by an unbranded fries up stand operated by levy restaurants in may it was reported by multiple news outlets that the atlanta falcons were interested in replacing the georgia dome with a newly constructed

isolated parts of the stadium officials stated that the issue was due to the fact that the roof was still not fully mechanized yet and that the issues would be fixed before the falcons season they also stated that the issues were common for newly constructed stadiums with retractable roofs since the retractable roof was one of the major features and design points of the stadium some of the problems with the roof were magnified in the stadium s first year of operation the roof which is supposed to open in as little as minutes with the push of a button was not fully operational by the time the stadium s primary tenants the atlanta falcons and the atlanta united fc seasons began the roof was required to be mechanically opened which was a very time consuming process as such the roof

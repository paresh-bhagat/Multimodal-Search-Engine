 angkor wat k r w t khmer city capital of temples is a temple complex in cambodia and is the largest religious monument in the world on a site measuring hectares m acres originally constructed as a hindu temple dedicated to the god vishnu for the khmer empire by king suryavarman ii it was gradually transformed into a buddhist temple towards the end of the th century as such it is also described as a hindu buddhist temple angkor wat was built at the behest of the khmer king suryavarman ii in the early th century in ya odharapura khmer present day angkor the capital of the khmer empire as his state temple and eventual mausoleum angkor wat combines two basic plans of khmer temple architecture the temple mountain and the later galleried temple it is designed to represent mount meru home of the devas in hindu mythology within a moat more than kilometres mi long and an outer wall kilometres mi long are three rectangular galleries each raised above the next at the centre of the temple stands a quincunx of towers unlike most angkorian temples angkor wat is oriented to the west scholars are divided as to the significance of this the temple is admired for the grandeur and harmony of the architecture its extensive bas reliefs and for the numerous devatas adorning its walls the modern name angkor wat alternatively nokor wat means temple city or city of temples in khmer angkor ngk r meaning city or capital city is a vernacular form of the word nokor n k r which comes from the sanskrit pali word nagara devan gar wat v tt is the word for temple grounds also derived from sanskrit pali v a devan gar meaning enclosure the original name of the temple was vrah vi uloka or parama vi uloka meaning the sacred dwelling of vishnu angkor wat lies kilometres mi north of the modern town of siem reap and a short distance south and slightly east of the previous capital which was centred at baphuon in an area of cambodia where there is an essential group of ancient structures it is the southernmost of angkor s main sites citation needed the construction of angkor wat took place over a period of years from ce during the reign of king suryavarman ii ruled c a brahmin by the name of div karapa ita c was responsible for urging suryavarman ii to construct the temple all of the original religious motifs at angkor wat derived from hinduism breaking from the shaiva tradition of previous kings angkor wat was instead dedicated to vishnu it was built as the king s state temple and capital city as neither the foundation stela nor any contemporary inscriptions referring to the temple have been found its original name is unknown but it may have been known as varah vishnu lok after the presiding deity work seems to have ended shortly after the king s death leaving some of the bas relief decoration unfinished the term vrah vi uloka or parama vi uloka literally means the king who has gone to the supreme world of vishnu which refer to suryavarman ii posthumously and intend to venerate his glory and memory in approximately years after the death of suryavarman ii angkor was sacked by the chams the traditional enemies of the khmer thereafter the empire was restored by a new king jayavarman vii who established a new capital and state temple angkor thom and the bayon respectively a few kilometers north dedicated to buddhism because the king believed that the hindu gods had failed him angkor wat was therefore also gradually converted into a buddhist site and many hindu sculptures were replaced by buddhist art towards the end of the th century angkor wat gradually transformed from a hindu centre of worship to buddhism which continues to the present day angkor wat is unusual among the angkor temples in that although it was largely neglected after the th century it was never completely abandoned fourteen inscriptions dated from the th century discovered in the angkor area testify to japanese buddhist pilgrims that had established small settlements alongside khmer locals at that time the temple was thought by the japanese visitors to be the famed jetavana garden of the buddha which was originally located in the kingdom of magadha india the best known inscription tells of ukondayu kazufusa who celebrated the khmer new year at angkor wat in one of the first western visitors to the temple was ant nio da madalena a portuguese friar who visited in and said that it is of such extraordinary construction that it is not possible to describe it with a pen particularly since it is like no other building in the world it has towers and decoration and all the refinements which the human genius can conceive of in the poem of angkor wat composed in khmer verse describes the beauty of angkor wat and creates a legend around the construction of the complex supposedly a divine castle built for legendary khmer king preah ket mealea by hindu god preah pisnukar or bra bis uk r vishvakarman as suryavarman ii had already vanished from people s minds in with the help of french missionary father charles mile bouillevaux the temple was effectively rediscovered by the french naturalist and explorer henri mouhot who popularised the site in the west through the publication of travel notes in which he wrote one of these temples a rival to that of solomon and erected by some ancient michelangelo might take an honorable place beside our most beautiful buildings it is grander than anything left to us by greece or rome and presents a sad contrast to the state of barbarism in which the nation is now plunged in german anthropologist adolf bastian undertook a four year trip to southeast asia and his account of this trip the people of east asia ran to six volumes when bastian finally published the studies and observations during his journey through cambodia to cochinchina in germany in told in detail but uninspiredly above all without a single one of his drawings of the angkorian sites this work hardly made an impression while everyone was talking about henri mouhot s posthumous work with vivid descriptions of angkor travels in the central parts of indo china siam cambodia and laos published in through the royal geographical society there were no ordinary dwellings or houses or other signs of settlement including cooking utensils weapons or items of clothing usually found at ancient sites instead there is only evidence of the monuments themselves the artistic legacy of angkor wat and other khmer monuments in the angkor region led directly to france adopting cambodia as a protectorate on august and invading siam to take control of the ruins this quickly led to cambodia reclaiming lands in the northwestern corner of the country such as the areas of siem reap battambang and sisophon which were under siamese rule from to angkor wat s aesthetics were on display in the plaster cast museum of louis delaporte called mus e indo chinois which existed in the parisian trocadero palace from c to the mid s the th century saw a considerable restoration of angkor wat gradually teams of laborers and archeologists pushed back the jungle and exposed the expanses of stone permitting the sun to once again illuminate the dark corners of the temple angkor wat caught the attention and imagination of a wider audience in europe when the pavilion of french protectorate of cambodia as part of french indochina recreated the life size replica of angkor wat during paris colonial exposition in cambodia gained independence from france on november and has controlled angkor wat since that time it is safe to say that from the colonial period onwards until the site s nomination as unesco world heritage in this specific temple of angkor wat was instrumental in the formation of the modern and gradually globalised concept of built cultural heritage restoration work was interrupted by the cambodian civil war and khmer rouge control of the country during the s and s but relatively little damage was done during this period camping khmer rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood and a shoot out between khmer rouge and vietnamese forces put a few bullet holes in a bas relief far more damage was done after the wars by art thieves working out of thailand which in the late s and early s claimed almost every head that could be lopped off the structures including reconstructions the temple is a powerful symbol of cambodia and is a source of great national pride that has factored into cambodia s diplomatic relations with france the united states and its neighbour thailand a depiction of angkor wat has been a part of cambodian national flags since the introduction of the first version circa from a larger historical and even transcultural perspective however the temple of angkor wat did not become a symbol of national pride sui generis but had been inscribed into a larger politico cultural process of french colonial heritage production in which the original temple site was presented in french colonial and universal exhibitions in paris and marseille between and in december it was announced that a research team from university of sydney had found a previously unseen ensemble of buried towers built and demolished during the construction of angkor wat as well as a massive structure of unknown purpose on its south side and wooden fortifications the findings also include evidence of low density residential occupation in the region with a road grid ponds and mounds these indicate that the temple precinct bounded by moat and wall may not have been used exclusively by the priestly elite as was previously thought the team used lidar ground penetrating radar and targeted excavation to map angkor wat according to a myth the construction of angkor wat was ordered by indra to serve as a palace for his son precha ket mealea according to the th century chinese traveller zhou daguan some believed that the temple was constructed in a single night by a divine architect angkor wat is a unique combination of the temple mountain the standard design for the empire s state temples and the later plan of concentric galleries most of which were derived from religious beliefs of hinduism originally the construction of angkor wat also suggests that there was a celestial significance with certain features of the temple this is observed in the temple s east west orientation and lines of sight from terraces within the temple that show specific towers to be at the precise location of the sunrise on a solstice the temple is a representation of mount meru the home of the gods according to hindu mythology the central quincunx of towers symbolises the five peaks of the mountain and the walls and moat symbolize the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level the angkor wat temple s main tower aligns to the morning sun of the spring equinox unlike most khmer temples angkor wat is oriented to the west rather than the east this has led many including maurice glaize and george coed s to conclude that suryavarman intended it to serve as his funerary temple further evidence for this view is provided by the bas reliefs which proceed in a counter clockwise direction prasavya in hindu terminology as this is the reverse of the normal order rituals take place in reverse order during brahminic funeral services archaeologist charles higham also describes a container which may have been a funerary jar which was recovered from the central tower it has been nominated by some as the greatest expenditure of energy on the disposal of a corpse freeman and jacques however note that several other temples of angkor depart from the typical eastern orientation and suggest that angkor wat s alignment was due to its dedication to vishnu who was associated with the west drawing on the temple s alignment and dimensions and on the content and arrangement of the bas reliefs researcher eleanor mannikka argues that the structure represents a claimed new era of peace under king suryavarman ii as the measurements of solar and lunar time cycles were built into the sacred space of angkor wat this divine mandate to rule was anchored to consecrated chambers and corridors meant to perpetuate the king s power and to honour and placate the deities manifest in the heavens above mannikka s suggestions have been received with a mixture of interest and scepticism in academic circles she distances herself from the speculations of others such as graham hancock that angkor wat is part of a representation of the constellation draco the oldest surviving plan of angkor wat dates to and is credited to fujiwara tadayoshi the plan is stored in the suifu meitoku kai shokokan museum in mito japan angkor wat is the prime example of the classical style of khmer architecture the angkor wat style to which it has given its name by the th century khmer architects had become skilled and confident in the use of sandstone rather than brick or laterite as the main building material most of the visible areas are of sandstone blocks while laterite was used for the outer wall and for hidden structural parts the binding agent used to join the blocks is yet to be identified although natural resins or slaked lime has been suggested the temple has drawn praise above all for the harmony of its design according to maurice glaize a mid th century conservator of angkor the temple attains a classic perfection by the restrained monumentality of its finely balanced elements and the precise arrangement of its proportions it is a work of power unity and style architecturally the elements characteristic of the style include the ogival redented towers shaped like lotus buds half galleries to broaden passageways axial galleries connecting enclosures and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple typical decorative elements are devatas or apsaras bas reliefs and on pediments extensive garlands and narrative scenes the statuary of angkor wat is considered conservative being more static and less graceful than earlier work other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time including gilded stucco on the towers gilding on some figures on the bas reliefs and wooden ceiling panels and doors architect jacques dumar ay believes the layout of angkor wat borrows chinese influence in its system of galleries which join at right angles to form courtyards however the axial pattern embedded in the plan of angkor wat may be derived from southeast asian cosmology in combination with the mandala represented by the main temple the outer wall m ft by m ft and m ft high is surrounded by a m ft apron of open ground and a moat m ft wide and over kilometres mi in perimeter the moat extends kilometres from east to west and kilometres from north to south access to the temple is by an earth bank to the east and a sandstone causeway to the west the latter the main entrance is a later addition possibly replacing a wooden bridge there are gopuras at each of the cardinal points the western is by far the largest and has three ruined towers glaize notes that this gopura both hides and echoes the form of the temple proper under the southern tower is a statue known as ta reach originally an eight armed statue of vishnu may have occupied the temple s central shrine galleries run between the towers and as far as two further entrances on either side of the gopura often referred to as elephant gates as they are large enough to admit those animals these galleries have square pillars on the outer west side and a closed wall on the inner east side the ceiling between the pillars is decorated with lotus rosettes the west face of the wall with dancing figures and the east face of the wall with balustered windows dancing male figures on prancing animals and devatas including south of the entrance the only one in the temple to be showing her teeth the outer wall encloses a space of square metres acres which besides the temple proper was originally occupied by the city and to the north of the temple the royal palace like all secular buildings of angkor these were built of perishable materials rather than of stone so nothing remains of them except the outlines of some of the streets most of the area is now covered by forest a m ft causeway connects the western gopura to the temple proper with naga balustrades and six sets of steps leading down to the city on either side each side also features a library with entrances at each cardinal point in front of the third set of stairs from the entrance and a pond between the library and the temple itself the ponds are later additions to the design as is the cruciform terrace guarded by lions connecting the causeway to the central structure the temple stands on a terrace raised higher than the city it is made of three rectangular galleries rising to a central tower each level higher than the last the two inner galleries each have four large towers at their ordinal corners that is nw ne se and sw surrounding a higher fifth tower this pattern is sometimes called a quincunx and represents the mountains of meru because the temple faces west the features are all set back towards the east leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side for the same reason the west facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides mannikka interprets the galleries as being dedicated to the king brahma the moon and vishnu each gallery has a gopura at each of the points the outer gallery measures m ft by m ft with pavilions rather than towers at the corners the gallery is open to the outside of the temple with columned half galleries extending and buttressing the structure connecting the outer gallery to the second enclosure on the west side is a cruciform cloister called preah poan meaning the thousand buddhas gallery buddha images were left in the cloister by pilgrims over the centuries although most have now been removed this area has many inscriptions relating the good deeds of pilgrims most written in khmer but others in burmese and japanese the four small courtyards marked out by the cloister may originally have been filled with water north and south of the cloister are libraries beyond the second and inner galleries are connected to each other and to two flanking libraries by another cruciform terrace again a later addition from the second level upwards devatas abound on the walls singly or in groups of up to four the second level enclosure is m ft by m ft and may originally have been flooded to represent the ocean around mount meru three sets of steps on each side lead up to the corner towers and gopuras of the inner gallery the very steep stairways represent the difficulty of ascending to the kingdom of the gods this inner gallery called the bakan is a m ft square with axial galleries connecting each gopura with the central shrine and subsidiary shrines located below the corner towers the roofings of the galleries are decorated with the motif of the body of a snake ending in the heads of lions or garudas carved lintels and pediments decorate the entrances to the galleries and to the shrines the tower above the central shrine rises m ft to a height of m ft above the ground unlike those of previous temple mountains the central tower is raised above the surrounding four the shrine itself originally occupied by a statue of vishnu and open on each side was walled in when the temple was converted to theravada buddhism the new walls featuring standing buddhas in the conservator george trouv excavated the pit beneath the central shrine filled with sand and water it had already been robbed of its treasure but he did find a sacred foundation deposit of gold leaf two metres above ground level integrated with the architecture of the building and one of the causes for its fame is angkor wat s extensive decoration which predominantly takes the form of bas relief friezes the inner walls of the outer gallery bear a series of large scale scenes mainly depicting episodes from the hindu epics the ramayana and the mahabharata higham has called these the greatest known linear arrangement of stone carving from the north west corner anti clockwise the western gallery shows the battle of lanka from the ramayana in which rama defeats ravana and the battle of kurukshetra from the mahabharata showing the mutual annihilation of the kaurava and pandava clans on the southern gallery follow the only historical scene a procession of suryavarman ii then the hells and heavens of hinduism on the eastern gallery is one of the most celebrated scenes the churning of the sea of milk showing asuras and devas using the serpent vasuki to churn the sea under vishnu s direction mannikka counts only asuras and explains the asymmetrical numbers as representing the number of days from the winter solstice to the spring equinox and from the equinox to the summer solstice it is followed by vishnu defeating asuras a th century addition the northern gallery shows krishna s victory over bana where according to glaize the workmanship is at its worst angkor wat is decorated with depictions of apsaras and devata there are more than depictions of devata in the present research inventory angkor wat architects employed small apsara images cm or in as decorative motifs on pillars and walls they incorporated larger devata images all full body portraits measuring approximately cm or in more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high towers in sappho marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair headdresses garments stance jewellery and decorative flowers which marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the angkor period the monument was made out of five to ten million sandstone blocks with a maximum weight of tons each the entire city of angkor used far greater amounts of stone than all the egyptian pyramids combined and occupied an area significantly greater than modern day paris moreover unlike the egyptian pyramids which use limestone quarried km mi away the entire city of angkor was built with sandstone quarried km mi or more away this sandstone had to be transported from mount kulen a quarry approximately kilometres mi northeast the route has been suggested to span kilometres mi along a canal towards tonl sap lake another kilometres mi crossing the lake and finally kilometres mi against the current along siem reap river making a total journey of kilometres mi however etsuo uchida and ichita shimoda of waseda university in tokyo japan have discovered in a shorter kilometre mi canal connecting mount kulen and angkor wat using satellite imagery the two believe that the khmer used this route instead virtually all of its surfaces columns lintels and even roofs are carved there are kilometres of reliefs illustrating scenes from indian literature including unicorns griffins winged dragons pulling chariots as well as warriors following an elephant mounted leader and celestial dancing girls with elaborate hairstyles the gallery wall alone is decorated with almost m sq ft of bas reliefs holes on some of the angkor walls indicate that they may have been decorated with bronze sheets these were highly prized in ancient times and were a prime target for robbers while excavating khajuraho alex evans a stonemason and sculptor recreated a stone sculpture under metres ft this took about days to carve roger hopkins and mark lehner also conducted experiments to quarry limestone which took quarrymen days to quarry about tons of stone the labour force to quarry transport carve and install so much sandstone must have run into the thousands including many highly skilled artisans the skills required to carve these sculptures were developed hundreds of years earlier as demonstrated by some artefacts that have been dated to the seventh century before the khmer came to power as with most other ancient temples in cambodia angkor wat has faced extensive damage and deterioration by a combination of plant overgrowth fungi ground movements war damage and theft the war damage to angkor wat s temples however has been very limited compared to the rest of cambodia s temple ruins and it has also received the most attentive restoration the restoration of angkor wat in the modern era began with the establishment of the conservation d angkor angkor conservancy by the cole fran aise d extr me orient efeo in before that date activities at the site were primarily concerned with exploration the conservation d angkor was responsible for the research conservation and restoration activities carried out at angkor until the early s and a major restoration of angkor was undertaken in the s work on angkor was abandoned during the khmer rouge era and the conservation d angkor was disbanded in between and the archaeological survey of india carried out restoration work on the temple as france did not recognise the cambodian government at the time criticisms have been raised about both the early french restoration attempts and particularly the later indian work with concerns over damage done to the stone surface by the use of chemicals and cement in following an appeal for help by norodom sihanouk angkor wat was listed in unesco s world heritage in danger later removed in and world heritage site together with an appeal by unesco to the international community to save angkor zoning of the area was set up to protect the angkor site in apsara was established in to protect and manage the area and a law to protect cambodian heritage was passed in a number of countries such as france japan and china are currently involved in various angkor wat conservation projects the german apsara conservation project gacp is working to protect the devatas and other bas reliefs which decorate the temple from damage the organisation s survey found that around of the devatas were in very poor condition mainly because of natural erosion and deterioration of the stone but in part also due to earlier restoration efforts other work involves the repair of collapsed sections of the structure and prevention of further collapse the west facade of the upper level for example has been buttressed by scaffolding since while a japanese team completed restoration of the north library of the outer enclosure in microbial biofilms have been found degrading sandstone at angkor wat preah khan and the bayon and west prasat in angkor the dehydration and radiation resistant filamentous cyanobacteria can produce organic acids that degrade the stone a dark filamentous fungus was found in internal and external preah khan samples while the alga trentepohlia was found only in samples taken from external pink stained stone at preah khan replicas have been made to replace some of the lost or damaged sculptures since the s angkor wat has become a major tourist destination in there were only visitors to the site by government figures show that foreign visitors had arrived in siem reap province that year approximately of all foreign tourists in cambodia the number reached over a million in and over two million by most visited angkor wat which received over two million foreign tourists in and million by the site was managed by the private sokimex group between and which rented it from the cambodian government the influx of tourists has so far caused relatively little damage other than some graffiti ropes and wooden steps have been introduced to protect the bas reliefs and floors respectively tourism has also provided some additional funds for maintenance as of approximately of ticket revenues across the whole angkor site was spent on the temples although most work is carried out by teams sponsored by foreign governments rather than by the cambodian authorities since angkor wat has seen significant growth in tourism throughout the years unesco and its international co ordinating committee for the safeguarding and development of the historic site of angkor icc in association with representatives from the royal government and apsara organised seminars to discuss the concept of cultural tourism wanting to avoid commercial and mass tourism the seminars emphasised the importance of providing high quality accommodation and services in order for the cambodian government to benefit economically while also incorporating the richness of cambodian culture in this incentive resulted in the concept of the angkor tourist city which would be developed with regard to traditional khmer architecture contain leisure and tourist facilities and provide luxurious hotels capable of accommodating large numbers of tourists the prospect of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both apsara and the icc claiming that previous tourism developments in the area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects have the potential to damage landscape features also the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town s water sewage and electricity systems it has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area such as the development of a large highway has had a direct effect on the underground water table subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at angkor wat locals of siem reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like angkor tourist city the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture at the asean tourism forum it was agreed that borobudur and angkor wat would become sister sites and the provinces sister provinces in the covid pandemic led to travel restrictions being introduced across the world which had a severe impact on cambodia s tourism sector as a result visitors to angkor wat plummeted leaving the usually crowded complex almost deserted

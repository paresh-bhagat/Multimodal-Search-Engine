academy he is honored with a monument on campus for the profound impact he had upon the academy founded as a school of engineering for the first half of the th century usma produced graduates who gained recognition for engineering the bulk of the nation s initial railway lines bridges harbors and roads the academy was the only engineering school in the country until the founding of rensselaer polytechnic institute in it was so successful in its engineering curriculum that it significantly influenced every american engineering school founded prior to the civil war in during the army s first year of the second seminole war they had only three generals winfield scott edmund p gaines and thomas s jesup the army s remaining fourteen generals held their rank by brevet only and none of them were west point graduates nearly the only way to obtain a commission up to was thru the academy which created loud complaint and added to the jacksonian democracy a deep desire to get rid of the academy where jacksonians were sure an aristocratic tradition was being bred the mexican american war brought the academy to prominence as graduates proved themselves in battle for the first time future civil war commanders ulysses s grant and robert e lee who also later became the superintendent of the academy first distinguished themselves in battle in mexico in all of graduates who served in the war received battlefield promotions or awards for bravery the school experienced a rapid modernization during the s often romanticized by the graduates who led both sides of the civil war as

advances created by the steam engine with the outbreak of the civil war west point graduates filled the general officer ranks of the rapidly expanding union and confederate armies graduates served as general officers for the union and served as general officers for the confederacy of all living graduates at the time of the war were killed and another were wounded nearly every general officer of note from either army during the civil war was a graduate of west point and a west point graduate commanded the forces of one or both sides in every one of the major battles of the war immediately following the civil war the academy enjoyed unprecedented fame as a result of the role its graduates had played however the post war years were a difficult time for the academy as it struggled to admit and reintegrate cadets from former confederate states the first cadets from southern states were re admitted in and saw the admission of the first black cadet james webster smith of south carolina smith endured harsh treatment and was eventually dismissed for academic deficiency under controversial circumstances in as a result henry o flipper of georgia became the first black graduate in graduating th in a class of two of the most notable graduates during this period were george washington goethals from the class of and john j pershing from the class of goethals gained prominence as the chief engineer of the panama canal and pershing would become famous for his exploits against the famed pancho villa in mexico and later for leading american forces during world war i besides the integration of southern state and black cadets the post war academy also struggled with the issue of hazing in its first years hazing was uncommon or non existent beyond small pranks played upon the incoming freshmen but took a harsher tone as civil war veterans began to fill the incoming freshman classes the upper class cadets saw it as their duty to teach the plebes their manners hazing at the academy entered the national spotlight with the death of former cadet oscar l booz on december congressional hearings which included testimony by cadet douglas macarthur investigated his death and the pattern of freshmen s systemic hazing when macarthur returned as superintendent he made an effort to end the practice of hazing the incoming freshmen by placing army sergeants in charge of training new cadets during freshman summer the practice of hazing continued on some levels well into the late th century but is no longer allowed in the present day the demand for junior officers during the spanish american war caused the class of to graduate early and the philippine american war did the same for the class of this increased demand for officers led congress to increase the corps of cadets size to cadets in the period between and saw a construction boom as much of west point s old infrastructure was rebuilt many of the academy s most famous graduates graduated during the year period between and douglas macarthur joseph stilwell henry hap arnold george s patton dwight d eisenhower and omar bradley both the class of is known as the class the stars fell on for the exceptionally high percentage of general officers that rose from that class of the outbreak of america s involvement in world war i caused a sharp increase in the demand for army officers and the academy accelerated graduation of all four classes then in attendance to meet this requirement beginning with the early graduation of the first class on april the second class in august and both the third and fourth classes just before the armistice of november when only freshman cadets remained those who had entered in the summer of in all wartime contingencies and post war adjustments resulted in ten classes varying in length of study from two to four years within a seven year period before the regular course of study was fully resumed douglas macarthur became superintendent in instituting sweeping reforms to the academic process including introducing a greater emphasis on history and humanities he made major changes to the field training regimen and the cadet honor committee was formed under his watch in macarthur was a firm supporter of athletics at the academy as he famously said upon the fields of friendly strife are sown the seeds that upon other fields on other days will bear the fruits of victory west point was first officially accredited in and in began granting bachelor of science degrees to all graduates in the academy s authorized strength increased to cadets as world war ii engulfed europe congress authorized an increase to cadets in and began graduating classes early the class of graduated six months early in january and the next four classes graduated after only three years to accommodate this accelerated schedule summer training was formally moved to a recently acquired piece of land southwest of main post the site would later become camp buckner the academy had its last serious brush with abolition or major reform during the war when some members of congress charged that even the accelerated curriculum allowed young men to hide out at west point and avoid combat duty a proposal was put forth to convert the academy to an officer s training school with a six month schedule but this was not adopted west point played a prominent role in wwii four of the five five star generals were alumni and nearly graduates died immediately following the war in maxwell taylor class of became superintendent he expanded and modernized the academic program and

penalty cadets are awarded punishment tours based upon the severity of the infraction being late to class or having an unkempt room may result in as little as hours while more severe misconduct infractions may result in upwards of to hours in its most traditional form punishment tours are walked off by wearing the dress gray uniform under arms and walking back and forth in a designated area of the cadet barracks courtyard known as central area cadets who get into trouble frequently and spend many weekends walking off their hours are known as area birds cadets who walk more than total hours in their career are affectionately known as century men an alternate form of punishment to walking hours is known as fatigue tours where assigned hours may be worked off by manual labor such as cleaning the barracks certain cadets whose academics are deficient may also conduct sitting tours where they have to sit hours in a designated academic room in a controlled study environment for which they receive half credit towards their reduction of tours cadets uniforms are inspected before their tours begin each day the inspection process is arduous and considered part of the punishment but the time spent does not count against the awarded number of tours a small number of cadets may be relieved of their tours that day if their uniforms are exceptionally presentable another tradition associated with punishment tours is that any visiting head of state has the authority to grant amnesty releasing all cadets with outstanding hours from the remainder of their assigned tours in the

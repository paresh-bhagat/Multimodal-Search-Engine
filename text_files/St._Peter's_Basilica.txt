 the papal basilica of saint peter in the vatican italian basilica papale di san pietro in vaticano or simply saint peter s basilica latin basilica sancti petri is a church built in the renaissance style located in vatican city the papal enclave that is within the city of rome italy it was initially planned by pope nicholas v and then pope julius ii to replace the aging old st peter s basilica which was built in the fourth century by roman emperor constantine the great construction of the present basilica began on april and was completed on november designed principally by donato bramante michelangelo carlo maderno and gian lorenzo bernini st peter s is the most renowned work of renaissance architecture and the largest church in the world by interior measure note while it is neither the mother church of the catholic church nor the cathedral of the diocese of rome these equivalent titles being held by the archbasilica of saint john lateran in rome st peter s is regarded as one of the holiest catholic shrines it has been described as holding a unique position in the christian world and as the greatest of all churches of christendom catholic tradition holds that the basilica is the burial site of saint peter chief among jesus s apostles and also the first bishop of rome pope saint peter s tomb is supposedly directly below the high altar of the basilica also known as the altar of the confession for this reason many popes have been interred at st peter s since the early christian period st peter s is famous as a place of pilgrimage and for its liturgical functions the pope presides at a number of liturgies throughout the year both within the basilica or the adjoining st peter s square these liturgies draw audiences numbering from to over people st peter s has many historical associations with the early christian church the papacy the protestant reformation and catholic counter reformation and numerous artists especially michelangelo as a work of architecture it is regarded as the greatest building of its age st peter s is one of the four churches in the world that hold the rank of major papal basilica all four of which are in rome and is also one of the seven pilgrim churches of rome contrary to popular misconception it is not a cathedral because it is not the seat of a bishop the cathedra of the pope as bishop of rome is at saint john lateran st peter s is a church built in the renaissance style located in the vatican city west of the river tiber and near the janiculum hill and hadrian s mausoleum its central dome dominates the skyline of rome the basilica is approached via st peter s square a forecourt in two sections both surrounded by tall colonnades the first space is oval and the second trapezoidal the fa ade of the basilica with a giant order of columns stretches across the end of the square and is approached by steps on which stand two metres ft statues of the first century apostles to rome saints peter and paul the basilica is cruciform in shape with an elongated nave in the latin cross form but the early designs were for a centrally planned structure and this is still in evidence in the architecture the central space is dominated both externally and internally by one of the largest domes in the world the entrance is through a narthex or entrance hall which stretches across the building one of the decorated bronze doors leading from the narthex is the holy door only opened during jubilees the interior dimensions are vast when compared to other churches one author wrote only gradually does it dawn upon us as we watch people draw near to this or that monument strangely they appear to shrink they are of course dwarfed by the scale of everything in the building this in its turn overwhelms us the nave which leads to the central dome is in three bays with piers supporting a barrel vault the highest of any church the nave is framed by wide aisles which have a number of chapels off them there are also chapels surrounding the dome moving around the basilica in a clockwise direction they are the baptistery the chapel of the presentation of the virgin the larger choir chapel the altar of the transfiguration the clementine chapel with the altar of saint gregory the sacristy entrance the altar of the lie the left transept with altars to the crucifixion of saint peter saint joseph and saint thomas the altar of the sacred heart the chapel of the madonna of column the altar of saint peter and the paralytic the apse with the chair of saint peter the altar of saint peter raising tabitha the altar of st petronilla the altar of the archangel michael the altar of the navicella the right transept with altars of saint erasmus saints processo and martiniano and saint wenceslas the altar of st jerome the altar of saint basil the gregorian chapel with the altar of the madonna of succour the larger chapel of the holy sacrament the chapel of saint sebastian and the chapel of the piet the monuments in a clockwise direction are to maria clementina sobieski the stuarts benedict xv john xxiii st pius x innocent viii leo xi innocent xi pius vii pius viii alexander vii alexander viii paul iii urban viii clement x clement xiii benedict xiv st peter bronze statue gregory xvi gregory xiv gregory xiii matilda of canossa innocent xii pius xii pius xi christina of sweden leo xii at the heart of the basilica beneath the high altar is the confessio or chapel of the confession in reference to the confession of faith by st peter which led to his martyrdom two curving marble staircases lead to this underground chapel at the level of the constantinian church and immediately above the purported burial place of saint peter the entire interior of st peter s is lavishly decorated with marble reliefs architectural sculpture and gilding the basilica contains a large number of tombs of popes and other notable people many of which are considered outstanding artworks there are also a number of sculptures in niches and chapels including michelangelo s piet the central feature is a baldachin or canopy over the papal altar designed by gian lorenzo bernini the apse culminates in a sculptural ensemble also by bernini and containing the symbolic chair of saint peter one observer wrote st peter s basilica is the reason why rome is still the centre of the civilized world for religious historical and architectural reasons it by itself justifies a journey to rome and its interior offers a palimpsest of artistic styles at their best the american philosopher ralph waldo emerson described st peter s as an ornament of the earth the sublime of the beautiful st peter s basilica is one of the papal basilicas previously styled patriarchal basilicas note and one of the four major basilicas of rome the other major basilicas all of which are also papal basilicas being the basilicas of st john lateran st mary major and st paul outside the walls the rank of major basilica confers on st peter s basilica precedence before all minor basilicas worldwide however unlike all the other papal major basilicas it is wholly within the territory and thus the sovereign jurisdiction of the vatican city state and not that of italy this is in contrast to the other three papal major basilicas which are within italian territory and not the territory of the vatican city state lateran treaty of article ibidem however the holy see fully owns these three basilicas and italy is legally obligated to recognize its full ownership thereof lateran treaty of article ibidem and to concede to all of them the immunity granted by international law to the headquarters of the diplomatic agents of foreign states lateran treaty of article ibidem it is the most prominent building in the vatican city its dome is a feature of the skyline of rome probably the largest church in christendom note it covers an area of hectares acres one of the holiest sites of christianity and catholic tradition it is traditionally the burial site of its titular st peter who was the head of the twelve apostles of jesus and according to tradition the first bishop of antioch and later the first bishop of rome rendering him the first pope although the new testament does not mention st peter s martyrdom in rome tradition based on the writings of the fathers of the church clarification needed holds that his tomb is below the baldachin and the altar of the basilica in the confession for this reason many popes have from the early years of the church been buried near pope st peter in the necropolis beneath the basilica construction of the current basilica over the old constantinian basilica began on april and finished in at length on november pope urban viii solemnly dedicated the basilica st peter s basilica is neither the pope s official seat nor first in rank among the major basilicas of rome this honour is held by the pope s cathedral the archbasilica of st john lateran which is the mother church of all churches in communion with the catholic church however st peter s is certainly the pope s principal church in terms of use because most papal liturgies and ceremonies take place there due to its size proximity to the papal residence and location within the vatican city proper the chair of saint peter or cathedra an ancient chair sometimes presumed to have been used by st peter himself but which was a gift from charles the bald and used by many popes symbolizes the continuing line of apostolic succession from st peter to the reigning pope it occupies an elevated position in the apse of the basilica supported symbolically by the doctors of the church and enlightened symbolically by the holy spirit as one of the constituent structures of the historically and architecturally significant vatican city st peter s basilica was inscribed as a unesco world heritage site in under criteria i ii iv and vi with an exterior area of square metres sq ft an interior area of square metres sq ft st peter s basilica is the largest christian church building in the world by the two latter metrics and the second largest by the first as of update the top of its dome at feet m also places it as the second tallest building in rome as of update the dome s soaring height placed it among the tallest buildings of the old world and it continues to hold the title of tallest dome in the world though the largest dome in the world by diameter at the time of its completion it no longer holds this distinction after the crucifixion of jesus it is recorded in the biblical book of the acts of the apostles that one of his twelve disciples simon known as saint peter a fisherman from galilee took a leadership position among jesus followers and was of great importance in the founding of the christian church the name peter is petrus in latin and petros in greek deriving from petra which means stone or rock in greek and is the literal translation of the aramaic kepa the name given to simon by jesus john and see matthew catholic tradition holds that peter after a ministry of thirty four years travelled to rome and met his martyrdom there along with paul on october ad during the reign of the roman emperor nero his execution was one of the many martyrdoms of christians following the great fire of rome according to jerome peter was crucified head downwards by his own request because he considered himself unworthy to die in the same manner as jesus the crucifixion took place near an ancient egyptian obelisk in the circus of nero the obelisk now stands in st peter s square and is revered as a witness to peter s death it is one of several ancient obelisks of rome according to tradition peter s remains were buried just outside the circus on the mons vaticanus across the via cornelia from the circus less than metres ft from his place of death the via cornelia was a road which ran east to west along the north wall of the circus on land now covered by the southern portions of the basilica and st peter s square a shrine was built on this site some years later almost three hundred years later old st peter s basilica was constructed over this site the area now covered by the vatican city had been a cemetery for some years before the circus of nero was built it was a burial ground for the numerous executions in the circus and contained many christian burials because for many years after the burial of saint peter many christians chose to be buried near peter in in the reign of pope pius xii years of archaeological research began under the crypt of the basilica in an area inaccessible since the ninth century the excavations revealed the remains of shrines of different periods at different levels from clement viii to callixtus ii and gregory i built over an aedicula containing fragments of bones that were folded in a tissue with gold decorations tinted with the precious murex purple although it could not be determined with certainty that the bones were those of peter the rare vestments suggested a burial of great importance on december in his pre christmas radio broadcast to the world pope pius xii announced the discovery of saint peter s tomb old st peter s basilica was the fourth century church begun by the emperor constantine the great between and ad it was of typical basilical form a wide nave and two aisles on each side and an apsidal end with the addition of a transept or bema giving the building the shape of a tau cross it was over metres ft long and the entrance was preceded by a large colonnaded atrium this church had been built over the small shrine believed to mark the burial place of st peter though the tomb was smashed in ad it contained a very large number of burials and memorials including those of most of the popes from st peter to the th century like all of the earliest churches in rome both this church and its successor had the entrance to the east and the apse at the west end of the building since the construction of the current basilica the name old st peter s basilica has been used for its predecessor to distinguish the two buildings by the end of the th century having been neglected during the period of the avignon papacy the old basilica had fallen into disrepair it appears that the first pope to consider rebuilding or at least making radical changes was pope nicholas v he commissioned work on the old building from leone battista alberti and bernardo rossellino and also had rossellino design a plan for an entirely new basilica or an extreme modification of the old his reign was frustrated by political problems and when he died little had been achieved he had however ordered the demolition of the colosseum and by the time of his death cartloads of stone had been transported for use in the new building note the foundations were completed for a new transept and choir to form a domed latin cross with the preserved nave and side aisles of the old basilica some walls for the choir had also been built pope julius ii planned far more for st peter s than nicholas v s program of repair or modification julius was at that time planning his own tomb which was to be designed and adorned with sculpture by michelangelo and placed within st peter s note in julius made a decision to demolish the ancient basilica and replace it with a monumental structure to house his enormous tomb and aggrandize himself in the popular imagination a competition was held and a number of the designs have survived at the uffizi gallery a succession of popes and architects followed in the next years their combined efforts resulting in the present building the scheme begun by julius ii continued through the reigns of leo x hadrian vi clement vii paul iii julius iii marcellus ii paul iv pius iv pius v saint gregory xiii sixtus v urban vii gregory xiv innocent ix clement viii leo xi paul v gregory xv urban viii and innocent x one method employed to finance the building of st peter s basilica was the granting of indulgences in return for contributions a major promoter of this method of fund raising was albrecht archbishop of mainz and magdeburg who had to clear debts owed to the roman curia by contributing to the rebuilding program to facilitate this he appointed the german dominican preacher johann tetzel whose salesmanship provoked a scandal a german augustinian priest martin luther wrote to archbishop albrecht arguing against this selling of indulgences he also included his disputation of martin luther on the power and efficacy of indulgences which came to be known as the theses this became a factor in starting the reformation the birth of protestantism pope julius scheme for the grandest building in christendom was the subject of a competition for which a number of entries remain intact in the uffizi gallery florence it was the design of donato bramante that was selected and for which the foundation stone was laid in this plan was in the form of an enormous greek cross with a dome inspired by that of the huge circular roman temple the pantheon the main difference between bramante s design and that of the pantheon is that where the dome of the pantheon is supported by a continuous wall that of the new basilica was to be supported only on four large piers this feature was maintained in the ultimate design bramante s dome was to be surmounted by a lantern with its own small dome but otherwise very similar in form to the early renaissance lantern of florence cathedral designed for brunelleschi s dome by michelozzo bramante had envisioned that the central dome would be surrounded by four lower domes at the diagonal axes the equal chancel nave and transept arms were each to be of two bays ending in an apse at each corner of the building was to stand a tower so that the overall plan was square with the apses projecting at the cardinal points each apse had two large radial buttresses which squared off its semi circular shape when pope julius died in bramante was replaced with giuliano da sangallo and fra giocondo who both died in bramante himself having died the previous year raphael was confirmed as the architect of st peter s on august the main change in his plan is the nave of five bays with a row of complex apsidal chapels off the aisles on either side raphael s plan for the chancel and transepts made the squareness of the exterior walls more definite by reducing the size of the towers and the semi circular apses more clearly defined by encircling each with an ambulatory in raphael also died aged and his successor baldassare peruzzi maintained changes that raphael had proposed to the internal arrangement of the three main apses but otherwise reverted to the greek cross plan and other features of bramante this plan did not go ahead because of various difficulties of both church and state in rome was sacked and plundered by emperor charles v peruzzi died in without his plan being realized at this point antonio da sangallo the younger submitted a plan which combines features of peruzzi raphael and bramante in its design and extends the building into a short nave with a wide fa ade and portico of dynamic projection his proposal for the dome was much more elaborate of both structure and decoration than that of bramante and included ribs on the exterior like bramante sangallo proposed that the dome be surmounted by a lantern which he redesigned to a larger and much more elaborate form sangallo s main practical contribution was to strengthen bramante s piers which had begun to crack on january in the reign of pope paul iii michelangelo then in his seventies succeeded sangallo the younger as capomaestro the superintendent of the building program at st peter s he is to be regarded as the principal designer of a large part of the building as it stands today and as bringing the construction to a point where it could be carried through he did not take on the job with pleasure it was forced upon him by pope paul frustrated at the death of his chosen candidate giulio romano and the refusal of jacopo sansovino to leave venice michelangelo wrote i undertake this only for the love of god and in honour of the apostle he insisted that he should be given a free hand to achieve the ultimate aim by whatever means he saw fit michelangelo took over a building site at which four piers enormous beyond any constructed since ancient roman times were rising behind the remaining nave of the old basilica he also inherited the numerous schemes designed and redesigned by some of the greatest architectural and engineering minds of the th century there were certain common elements in these schemes they all called for a dome to equal that engineered by brunelleschi a century earlier and which has since dominated the skyline of renaissance florence and they all called for a strongly symmetrical plan of either greek cross form like the iconic st mark s basilica in venice or of a latin cross with the transepts of identical form to the chancel as at florence cathedral even though the work had progressed only a little in years michelangelo did not simply dismiss the ideas of the previous architects he drew on them in developing a grand vision above all michelangelo recognized the essential quality of bramante s original design he reverted to the greek cross and as helen gardner expresses it without destroying the centralising features of bramante s plan michelangelo with a few strokes of the pen converted its snowflake complexity into massive cohesive unity as it stands today st peter s has been extended with a nave by carlo maderno it is the chancel end the ecclesiastical eastern end with its huge centrally placed dome that is the work of michelangelo because of its location within the vatican state and because the projection of the nave screens the dome from sight when the building is approached from the square in front of it the work of michelangelo is best appreciated from a distance what becomes apparent is that the architect has greatly reduced the clearly defined geometric forms of bramante s plan of a square with square projections and also of raphael s plan of a square with semi circular projections michelangelo has blurred the definition of the geometry by making the external masonry of massive proportions and filling in every corner with a small vestry or stairwell the effect created is of a continuous wall surface that is folded or fractured at different angles but lacks the right angles which usually define change of direction at the corners of a building this exterior is surrounded by a giant order of corinthian pilasters all set at slightly different angles to each other in keeping with the ever changing angles of the wall s surface above them the huge cornice ripples in a continuous band giving the appearance of keeping the whole building in a state of compression the dome of st peter s rises to a total height of metres ft from the floor of the basilica to the top of the external cross it is the tallest dome in the world note its internal diameter is metres ft slightly smaller than two of the three other huge domes that preceded it those of the pantheon of ancient rome metres ft and florence cathedral of the early renaissance metres ft it has a greater diameter by approximately feet m than constantinople s hagia sophia church completed in it was to the domes of the pantheon and florence duomo that the architects of st peter s looked for solutions as to how to go about building what was conceived from the outset as the greatest dome of christendom the dome of the pantheon stands on a circular wall with no entrances or windows except a single door the whole building is as high as it is wide its dome is constructed in a single shell of concrete made light by the inclusion of a large amount of the volcanic stones tuff and pumice the inner surface of the dome is deeply coffered which has the effect of creating both vertical and horizontal ribs while lightening the overall load at the summit is an ocular opening metres ft across which provides light to the interior bramante s plan for the dome of st peter s follows that of the pantheon very closely and like that of the pantheon was designed to be constructed in tufa concrete for which he had rediscovered a formula with the exception of the lantern that surmounts it the profile is very similar except that in this case the supporting wall becomes a drum raised high above ground level on four massive piers the solid wall as used at the pantheon is lightened at st peter s by bramante piercing it with windows and encircling it with a peristyle in the case of florence cathedral the desired visual appearance of the pointed dome existed for many years before brunelleschi made its construction feasible note its double shell construction of bricks locked together in a herringbone pattern re introduced from byzantine architecture and the gentle upward slope of its eight stone ribs made it possible for the construction to take place without the massive wooden formwork necessary to construct hemispherical arches while its appearance with the exception of the details of the lantern is entirely gothic its engineering was highly innovative and the product of a mind that had studied the huge vaults and remaining dome of ancient rome sangallo s plan of which a large wooden model still exists looks to both these predecessors he realized the value of both the coffering at the pantheon and the outer stone ribs at florence cathedral he strengthened and extended the peristyle of bramante into a series of arched and ordered openings around the base with a second such arcade set back in a tier above the first in his hands the rather delicate form of the lantern based closely on that in florence became a massive structure surrounded by a projecting base a peristyle and surmounted by a spire of conic form according to james lees milne the design was too eclectic too pernickety and too tasteless to have been a success michelangelo redesigned the dome in taking into account all that had gone before his dome like that of florence is constructed of two shells of brick the outer one having stone ribs twice the number at florence but far fewer than in sangallo s design as with the designs of bramante and sangallo the dome is raised from the piers on a drum the encircling peristyle of bramante and the arcade of sangallo are reduced to pairs of corinthian columns each of metres ft high which stand proud of the building connected by an arch visually they appear to buttress each of the ribs but structurally they are probably quite redundant the reason for this is that the dome is ovoid in shape rising steeply as does the dome of florence cathedral and therefore exerting less outward thrust than does a hemispherical dome such as that of the pantheon which although it is not buttressed is countered by the downward thrust of heavy masonry which extends above the circling wall the ovoid profile of the dome has been the subject of much speculation and scholarship over the past century michelangelo died in leaving the drum of the dome complete and bramante s piers much bulkier than originally designed each metres ft across following his death the work continued under his assistant jacopo barozzi da vignola with giorgio vasari appointed by pope pius v as a watchdog to make sure that michelangelo s plans were carried out exactly despite vignola s knowledge of michelangelo s intentions little happened in this period in the energetic pope sixtus v appointed giacomo della porta who was to be assisted by domenico fontana the five year reign of sixtus was to see the building advance at a great rate michelangelo left a few drawings including an early drawing of the dome and some details there were also detailed engravings published in by stefan du p rac who claimed that they were the master s final solution michelangelo like sangallo before him also left a large wooden model giacomo della porta subsequently altered this model in several ways the major change restored an earlier design in which the outer dome appears to rise above rather than rest directly on the base most of the other changes were of a cosmetic nature such as the adding of lion s masks over the swags on the drum in honour of pope sixtus and adding a circlet of finials around the spire at the top of the lantern as proposed by sangallo a drawing by michelangelo indicates that his early intentions were towards an ovoid dome rather than a hemispherical one in an engraving in galasso alghisi treatise the dome may be represented as ovoid but the perspective is ambiguous stefan du p rac s engraving shows a hemispherical dome but this was perhaps an inaccuracy of the engraver the profile of the wooden model is more ovoid than that of the engravings but less so than the finished product it has been suggested that michelangelo on his death bed reverted to the more pointed shape however lees milne cites giacomo della porta as taking full responsibility for the change and as indicating to pope sixtus that michelangelo was lacking in the scientific understanding of which he himself was capable helen gardner suggests that michelangelo made the change to the hemispherical dome of lower profile in order to establish a balance between the dynamic vertical elements of the encircling giant order of pilasters and a more static and reposeful dome gardner also comments the sculpturing of architecture by michelangelo here extends itself up from the ground through the attic stories and moves on into the drum and dome the whole building being pulled together into a unity from base to summit it is this sense of the building being sculptured unified and pulled together by the encircling band of the deep cornice that led eneide mignacca to conclude that the ovoid profile seen now in the end product was an essential part of michelangelo s first and last concept the sculptor architect has figuratively speaking taken all the previous designs in hand and compressed their contours as if the building were a lump of clay the dome must appear to thrust upwards because of the apparent pressure created by flattening the building s angles and restraining its projections if this explanation is the correct one then the profile of the dome is not merely a structural solution as perceived by giacomo della porta it is part of the integrated design solution that is about visual tension and compression in one sense michelangelo s dome may appear to look backward to the gothic profile of florence cathedral and ignore the classicism of the renaissance but on the other hand perhaps more than any other building of the th century it prefigures the architecture of the baroque giacomo della porta and domenico fontana brought the dome to completion in the last year of the reign of sixtus v his successor gregory xiv saw fontana complete the lantern and had an inscription to the honour of sixtus v placed around its inner opening the next pope clement viii had the cross raised into place an event which took all day and was accompanied by the ringing of the bells of all the city s churches in the arms of the cross are set two lead caskets one containing a fragment of the true cross and a relic of st andrew and the other containing medallions of the holy lamb in the mid th century cracks appeared in the dome so four iron chains were installed between the two shells to bind it like the rings that keep a barrel from bursting as many as ten chains have been installed at various times the earliest possibly planned by michelangelo himself as a precaution as brunelleschi did at florence cathedral around the inside of the dome is written in letters metres ft high tv es petrvs et svper hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam et tibi dabo claves regni caelorvm you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven vulgate matthew beneath the lantern is the inscription s petri gloriae sixtvs pp v a m d xc pontif v to the glory of st peter sixtus v pope in the year the fifth of his pontificate on december a fragment of a red chalk drawing of a section of the dome of the basilica almost certainly by the hand of michelangelo was discovered in the vatican archives the drawing shows a small precisely drafted section of the plan of the entablature above two of the radial columns of the cupola drum michelangelo is known to have destroyed thousands of his drawings before his death the rare survival of this example is probably due to its fragmentary state and the fact that detailed mathematical calculations had been made over the top of the drawing on february under pope paul v the dismantling of the remaining parts of the constantinian basilica began the marble cross that had been set at the top of the pediment by pope sylvester and constantine the great was lowered to the ground the timbers were salvaged for the roof of the borghese palace and two rare black marble columns the largest of their kind were carefully stored and later used in the narthex the tombs of various popes were opened treasures removed and plans made for re interment in the new basilica the pope had appointed carlo maderno in he was a nephew of domenico fontana and had demonstrated himself as a dynamic architect maderno s idea was to ring michelangelo s building with chapels but the pope was hesitant about deviating from the master s plan even though he had been dead for forty years the fabbrica or building committee a group drawn from various nationalities and generally despised by the curia who viewed the basilica as belonging to rome rather than christendom were in a quandary as to how the building should proceed one of the matters that influenced their thinking was the counter reformation which increasingly associated a greek cross plan with paganism and saw the latin cross as truly symbolic of christianity the central plan also did not have a dominant orientation toward the east another influence on the thinking of both the fabbrica and the curia was a certain guilt at the demolition of the ancient building the ground on which it and its various associated chapels vestries and sacristies had stood for so long was hallowed the only solution was to build a nave that encompassed the whole space in a committee of ten architects was called together and a decision was made to extend michelangelo s building into a nave maderno s plans for both the nave and the facade were accepted the building of the nave began on may and proceeded at a great rate with an army of labourers being employed the following year the fa ade was begun in december the final touches were added to the stucco decoration of the vault and early in the partition wall between the two sections was pulled down all the rubble was carted away and the nave was ready for use by palm sunday the facade designed by maderno is metres ft wide and metres ft high and is built of travertine stone with a giant order of corinthian columns and a central pediment rising in front of a tall attic surmounted by thirteen statues christ flanked by eleven of the apostles except saint peter whose statue is left of the stairs and john the baptist note the inscription below the cornice on the metre ft tall frieze reads in honorem principis apost pavlvs v bvrghesivs romanvs pont max an mdcxii pont vii in honour of the prince of apostles paul v borghese a roman supreme pontiff in the year the seventh of his pontificate paul v camillo borghese born in rome but of a sienese family liked to emphasize his romanness the facade is often cited as the least satisfactory part of the design of st peter s the reasons for this according to james lees milne are that it was not given enough consideration by the pope and committee because of the desire to get the building completed quickly coupled with the fact that maderno was hesitant to deviate from the pattern set by michelangelo at the other end of the building lees milne describes the problems of the fa ade as being too broad for its height too cramped in its details and too heavy in the attic story the breadth is caused by modifying the plan to have towers on either side these towers were never executed above the line of the facade because it was discovered that the ground was not sufficiently stable to bear the weight one effect of the facade and lengthened nave is to screen the view of the dome so that the building from the front has no vertical feature except from a distance behind the fa ade of st peter s stretches a long portico or narthex such as was occasionally found in italian churches this is the part of maderno s design with which he was most satisfied its long barrel vault is decorated with ornate stucco and gilt and successfully illuminated by small windows between pendentives while the ornate marble floor is beamed with light reflected in from the piazza at each end of the narthex is a theatrical space framed by ionic columns and within each is set a statue an equestrian statue of charlemagne th century by cornacchini in the south end and the vision of constantine by bernini in the north end five portals of which three are framed by huge salvaged antique columns lead into the basilica the central portal has a bronze door created by antonio averulino c for the old basilica and somewhat enlarged to fit the new space to the single bay of michelangelo s greek cross maderno added a further three bays he made the dimensions slightly different from michelangelo s bay thus defining where the two architectural works meet maderno also tilted the axis of the nave slightly this was not by accident as suggested by his critics an ancient egyptian obelisk had been erected in the square outside but had not been quite aligned with michelangelo s building so maderno compensated in order that it should at least align with the basilica s fa ade the nave has huge paired pilasters in keeping with michelangelo s work the size of the interior is so stupendously large that it is hard to get a sense of scale within the building note the four cherubs who flutter against the first piers of the nave carrying between them two holy water basins appear of quite normal cherubic size until approached then it becomes apparent that each one is over metres high and that real children cannot reach the basins unless they scramble up the marble draperies the aisles each have two smaller chapels and a larger rectangular chapel the chapel of the sacrament and the choir chapel these are lavishly decorated with marble stucco gilt sculpture and mosaic remarkably all of the large altarpieces with the exception of the holy trinity by pietro da cortona in the blessed sacrament chapel have been reproduced in mosaic two precious paintings from the old basilica our lady of perpetual help and our lady of the column are still being used as altarpieces maderno s last work at st peter s was to design a crypt like space or confessio under the dome where the cardinals and other privileged persons could descend in order to be nearer to the burial place of the apostle its marble steps are remnants of the old basilica and around its balustrade are bronze lamps the design of st peter s basilica and in particular its dome has greatly influenced church architecture in western christendom within rome the huge domed church of sant andrea della valle was designed by giacomo della porta before the completion of st peter s basilica and subsequently worked on by carlo maderno this was followed by the domes of san carlo ai catinari sant agnese in agone and many others christopher wren s dome at st paul s cathedral london england the domes of karlskirche vienna austria st nicholas church prague czech republic and the pantheon paris france all pay homage to st peter s basilica the th and early th century architectural revivals brought about the building of a great number of churches that imitate elements of st peter s to a greater or lesser degree including st mary of the angels in chicago st josaphat s basilica in milwaukee immaculate heart of mary in pittsburgh and mary queen of the world cathedral in montreal which replicates many aspects of st peter s on a smaller scale postmodernism has seen free adaptations of st peter s in the basilica of our lady of liche and the basilica of our lady of peace of yamoussoukro as a young boy gian lorenzo bernini visited st peter s with the painter annibale carracci and stated his wish to build a mighty throne for the apostle his wish came true as a young man in he received the patronage of pope urban viii and worked on the embellishment of the basilica for years appointed as maderno s successor in he was to become regarded as the greatest architect and sculptor of the baroque period bernini s works at st peter s include the baldachin baldaquin from italian baldacchino the chapel of the sacrament the plan for the niches and loggias in the piers of the dome and the chair of st peter bernini s first work at st peter s was to design the baldacchino a pavilion like structure metres ft tall and claimed to be the largest piece of bronze in the world which stands beneath the dome and above the altar its design is based on the ciborium of which there are many in the churches of rome serving to create a sort of holy space above and around the table on which the sacrament is laid for the eucharist and emphasizing the significance of this ritual these ciboria are generally of white marble with inlaid coloured stone bernini s concept was for something very different he took his inspiration in part from the baldachin or canopy carried above the head of the pope in processions and in part from eight ancient columns that had formed part of a screen in the old basilica their twisted barley sugar shape had a special significance as they were modelled on those of the temple of jerusalem and donated by the emperor constantine based on these columns bernini created four huge columns of bronze twisted and decorated with laurel leaves and bees which were the emblem of pope urban the baldacchino is surmounted not with an architectural pediment like most baldacchini but with curved baroque brackets supporting a draped canopy like the brocade canopies carried in processions above precious iconic images in this case the draped canopy is of bronze and all the details including the olive leaves bees and the portrait heads of urban s niece in childbirth and her newborn son are picked out in gold leaf the baldacchino stands as a vast free standing sculptural object central to and framed by the largest space within the building it is so large that the visual effect is to create a link between the enormous dome which appears to float above it and the congregation at floor level of the basilica it is penetrated visually from every direction and is visually linked to the cathedra petri in the apse behind it and to the four piers containing large statues that are at each diagonal as part of the scheme for the central space of the church bernini had the huge piers begun by bramante and completed by michelangelo hollowed out into niches and had staircases made inside them leading to four balconies there was much dismay from those who thought that the dome might fall but it did not on the balconies bernini created showcases framed by the eight ancient twisted columns to display the four most precious relics of the basilica the spear of longinus said to have pierced the side of christ the veil of veronica with the miraculous image of the face of christ a fragment of the true cross discovered in jerusalem by constantine s mother helena and a relic of saint andrew the brother of saint peter in each of the niches that surround the central space of the basilica was placed a huge statue of the saint associated with the relic above only saint longinus is the work of bernini see below urban had long been a critic of bernini s predecessor carlo maderno his disapproval of the architect s work stemmed largely from the maderno s design for the longitudinal nave of st peters which was widely condemned for obscuring michelangelo s dome when the pope gave the commission to bernini he therefore requested that a new design for the facade s bell towers to be submitted for consideration baldinucci describes bernini s tower as consisting of two orders of columns and pilasters the first order being corinthian and a third or attic story formed of pilasters and two columns on either side of the open archway in the center urban desired the towers to be completed by a very specific date june the feast day dedicated to saints peter and paul to this end an order was issued which stated that all work should take a second seat to that of the campanile the south tower was completed on time even in spite of these issues but records show that in the wake of the unveiling the pope was not content with what he saw and he ordered the top level of bernini s tower removed so that the structure could be made even grander the tower continued to grow and as the construction began to settle the first cracks started to appear followed by urban s infamous public admonishment of his architect in all work on both towers came to a halt bernini had to pay the cost for the demolition eventually the idea of completing the bell towers was abandoned bernini then turned his attention to another precious relic the so called cathedra petri or throne of st peter a chair which was often claimed to have been used by the apostle but appears to date from the th century as the chair itself was fast deteriorating and was no longer serviceable pope alexander vii determined to enshrine it in suitable splendor as the object upon which the line of successors to peter was based bernini created a large bronze throne in which it was housed raised high on four looping supports held effortlessly by massive bronze statues of four doctors of the church saints ambrose and augustine representing the latin church and athanasius and john chrysostom the greek church the four figures are dynamic with sweeping robes and expressions of adoration and ecstasy behind and above the cathedra a blaze of light comes in through a window of yellow alabaster illuminating at its centre the dove of the holy spirit the elderly painter andrea sacchi had urged bernini to make the figures large so that they would be seen well from the central portal of the nave the chair was enshrined in its new home with great celebration of january bernini s final work for st peter s undertaken in was the decoration of the chapel of the sacrament to hold the sacramental host he designed a miniature version in gilt bronze of bramante s tempietto the little chapel that marks the place of the death of st peter on either side is an angel one gazing in rapt adoration and the other looking towards the viewer in welcome bernini died in in his nd year to the east of the basilica is the piazza di san pietro st peter s square the present arrangement constructed between and is the baroque inspiration of bernini who inherited a location already occupied by an egyptian obelisk which was centrally placed with some contrivance to maderno s facade note the obelisk known as the witness at metres ft and a total height including base and the cross on top of metres ft is the second largest standing obelisk and the only one to remain standing since its removal from egypt and re erection at the circus of nero in ad where it is thought to have stood witness to the crucifixion of saint peter its removal to its present location by order of pope sixtus v and engineered by domenico fontana on september was an operation fraught with difficulties and nearly ending in disaster when the ropes holding the obelisk began to smoke from the friction fortunately this problem was noticed by benedetto bresca a sailor of sanremo and for his swift intervention his town was granted the privilege of providing the palms that are used at the basilica each palm sunday the other object in the old square with which bernini had to contend was a large fountain designed by maderno in and set to one side of the obelisk making a line parallel with the facade bernini s plan uses this horizontal axis as a major feature of his unique spatially dynamic and highly symbolic design the most obvious solutions were either a rectangular piazza of vast proportions so that the obelisk stood centrally and the fountain and a matching companion could be included or a trapezoid piazza which fanned out from the facade of the basilica like that in front of the palazzo pubblico in siena the problems of the square plan are that the necessary width to include the fountain would entail the demolition of numerous buildings including some of the vatican and would minimize the effect of the facade the trapezoid plan on the other hand would maximize the apparent width of the facade which was already perceived as a fault of the design bernini s ingenious solution was to create a piazza in two sections that part which is nearest the basilica is trapezoid but rather than fanning out from the facade it narrows this gives the effect of countering the visual perspective it means that from the second part of the piazza the building looks nearer than it is the breadth of the facade is minimized and its height appears greater in proportion to its width the second section of the piazza is a huge elliptical circus which gently slopes downwards to the obelisk at its centre the two distinct areas are framed by a colonnade formed by doubled pairs of columns supporting an entablature of the simple tuscan order the part of the colonnade that is around the ellipse does not entirely encircle it but reaches out in two arcs symbolic of the arms of the catholic church reaching out to welcome its communicants the obelisk and maderno s fountain mark the widest axis of the ellipse bernini balanced the scheme with another fountain in the approach to the square used to be through a jumble of old buildings which added an element of surprise to the vista that opened up upon passing through the colonnade nowadays a long wide street the via della conciliazione built by mussolini after the conclusion of the lateran treaties leads from the river tiber to the piazza and gives distant views of st peter s as the visitor approaches with the basilica acting as a terminating vista bernini s transformation of the site is entirely baroque in concept where bramante and michelangelo conceived a building that stood in self sufficient isolation bernini made the whole complex expansively relate to its environment banister fletcher says no other city has afforded such a wide swept approach to its cathedral church no other architect could have conceived a design of greater nobility it is the greatest of all atriums before the greatest of all churches of christendom the top of the facade of st peter s basilica has two clocks and several sculptures the clocks were created to replace bernini s bell towers which had to be torn down due to insufficient support the left clock shows rome time the one of the right shows european mean time the statues are christ the redeemer st john the baptist and apostles from the left st thadeus st matthew st philip st thomas st james the greater st john the baptist the redeemer st andrew st john the evangelist st james the lesser st bartholomew st simeon and st matthias above the roman clock is the coat of arms for the city state of vatican city since held by two angels citation needed the basilica has bells placed in the room under the roman clock only of them are visible from ground level while the rest are hidden behind the bourdon they range from the smallest which is kg to the massive bourdon that approximately weighs tonnes from the bells are operated electrically thus permitting even the largest bell to be tolled from a distance the oldest bell rota dates from and the bourdon called campanone is rung at christmas and easter on the solemnity of sts peter and paul and every time the pope imparts the urbi et orbi blessing to the city and to the world campanone also announces the election of a new pope there are over tombs within st peter s basilica extant to various extents many located beneath the basilica these include popes saint ignatius of antioch holy roman emperor otto ii and the composer giovanni pierluigi da palestrina exiled catholic british royalty james francis edward stuart and his two sons charles edward stuart and henry benedict stuart cardinal bishop of frascati are buried here having been granted asylum by pope clement xi also buried here are maria clementina sobieska wife of james francis edward stuart queen christina of sweden who abdicated her throne in order to convert to catholicism and countess matilda of tuscany supporter of the papacy during the investiture controversy

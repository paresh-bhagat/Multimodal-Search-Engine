 epcot stylized in all uppercase as epcot is a theme park at the walt disney world resort in bay lake florida it is owned and operated by the walt disney company through its parks experiences and products division inspired by an unrealized concept developed by walt disney the park opened on october as epcot center and was the second of four theme parks built at walt disney world after magic kingdom park spanning acres hectares more than twice the size of magic kingdom park epcot is dedicated to the celebration of human achievement namely technological innovation and international culture and is often referred to as a permanent world s fair epcot was originally conceived by walt disney during the early development of walt disney world as an experimental planned community that would serve as a center for american enterprise and urban living known as epcot an acronym for experimental prototype community of tomorrow the idea included an urban city center residential areas industrial areas schools and a series of mass transportation systems that would connect the community after disney s death in the epcot concept was abandoned as the company was uncertain about the feasibility of operating a city in the s wed enterprises began developing a second theme park for the resort to supplement magic kingdom as that park s popularity grew the new park reprised the idea of showcasing modern innovation through avant garde edutainment attractions as well as the addition of a world nations exposition the newly designed park featuring two sections future world and world showcase opened as epcot center in in the park was renamed to epcot dropping the acronym and center from the name in the late s the park began a major ongoing multi year overhaul including several new and replaced attractions as well as the revision of the existing two sections of the park into four world celebration world discovery world nature and world showcase in epcot hosted million guests ranking it as the fourth most visited theme park in north america and the seventh most visited theme park in the world the park is represented by spaceship earth a geodesic sphere the genesis for epcot was originally conceived as a utopian city of the future by walt disney in the s the concept was an acronym for experimental prototype community of tomorrow often interchanging city and community in walt disney s words in epcot will take its cue from the new ideas and new technologies that are now emerging from the creative centers of american industry it will be a community of tomorrow that will never be completed but will always be introducing and testing and demonstrating new materials and new systems and epcot will always be a showcase to the world of the ingenuity and imagination of american free enterprise walt disney s original vision was for a model community that would have been home to twenty thousand residents and a test bed for city planning as well as organization it was to have been built in the shape of a circle with businesses and commercial areas at its center with community buildings schools and recreational complexes around it while residential neighborhoods would line the perimeter this radial plan concept is strongly influenced by british planner ebenezer howard and his garden cities of to morrow transportation would have been provided by monorails and peoplemovers like those in tomorrowland automobile traffic would be kept underground leaving pedestrians safe above ground walt disney was not able to obtain funding and permission to start work on his florida property until he agreed to first build magic kingdom he died nearly five years before magic kingdom opened after walt disney s death walt disney productions decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city without walt s guidance the model community of celebration florida has been mentioned as a realization of disney s original vision but celebration is based on concepts of new urbanism which is radically different from disney s modernist and futurist visions however the idea of epcot was instrumental in prompting the state of florida to create the reedy creek improvement district rcid and the cities of bay lake and reedy creek now lake buena vista a legislative mechanism enshrined in laws like the reedy creek improvement act allowing disney to exercise governmental powers over walt disney world control over the rcid is vested in the landowners of the district and the promise of an actual city in the district would have meant that the powers of the rcid would have been distributed among the landowners in epcot because the idea of epcot was never implemented disney remained almost the sole landowner in the district allowing it to maintain control of the rcid and the cities of bay lake and lake buena vista disney further cemented this control by deannexing celebration from the rcid the original plans for the park showed indecision over the park s purpose some imagineers wanted it to represent the cutting edge of emerging technologies while others wanted it to showcase international cultures and customs at one point a model of the futuristic park was pushed together against a model of a world s fair international theme and the two were combined the park was originally named epcot center to reflect the ideals and values of the city it was constructed for an estimated million to billion and took three years to build at the time the largest construction project on earth the parking lot serving the park is acres ha including bus area and can accommodate vehicles grass areas hold additional vehicles before it opened on october walt disney world ambassador genie field introduced e

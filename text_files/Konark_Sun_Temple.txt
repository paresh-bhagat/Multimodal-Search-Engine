indian state of odisha the nearest airport is biju patnaik airport in bhubaneswar odisha both puri and bhubaneswar are major railway hubs connected by indian railways the konark sun temple was built in ce during the reign of the eastern ganga king narsimhadeva from stone in the form of a giant ornamented chariot dedicated to the sun god surya in hindu vedic iconography surya is represented as rising in the east and traveling rapidly across the sky in a chariot drawn by seven horses he is described typically as a resplendent standing person holding a lotus flower in both his hands riding the chariot marshaled by the charioteer aruna the seven horses are named after the seven meters of sanskrit prosody gayatri brihati ushnih jagati trishtubha anushtubha and pankti typically seen flanking surya are two females who represent the dawn goddesses usha and pratyusha the goddesses are shown to be shooting arrows a symbol of their initiative in challenging the darkness the architecture is also symbolic with the chariot s twelve pairs of wheels corresponding to the months of the hindu calendar each month paired into two cycles shukla and krishna the konark temple presents this iconography on a grand scale it has elaborately carved stone wheels which are nearly feet m in diameter and are pulled by a set of seven horses when viewed from inland during the dawn and sunrise the chariot shaped temple appears to emerge from the depths of the blue sea carrying the sun the temple plan includes all the traditional elements of a hindu temple set on a square plan according to kapila vatsyayan the ground plan as well the layout of sculptures and reliefs follow the square and circle geometry forms found in odisha temple design texts such as the silpasarini this mandala structure informs the plans of other hindu temples in odisha and elsewhere the main temple at konark locally called the deul no longer exists it was surrounded by subsidiary shrines containing niches depicting hindu deities particularly surya in many of his aspects the deul was built on a high terrace the temple was originally a complex consisting of the main sanctuary called the rekha deul or bada deul lit big sanctum in front of it was the bhadra deul lit small sanctum or jagamohana lit assembly hall of the people called a mandapa in other parts of india the attached platform was called the pida deul which consisted of a square mandapa with a pyramidal roof all of these structures were square at their core and each was overlain with the pancharatha plan containing a variegated exterior the central projection called the raha is more pronounced than the side projections called kanika paga a style that aims for an interplay of sunlight and shade and adds to the visual appeal of the structure throughout the day the design manual for this style is found in the silpa sastra of ancient odisha twice as wide as they were high the walls of the jagamohana are feet m tall the surviving structure has three tiers of six pidas each these diminish incrementally and repeat the lower patterns the pidas are divided into terraces on each of these terraces stand statues of musician figures the main temple and the jagamohana porch consist of four main zones the platform the wall the trunk and the crowning head called a mastaka the first three are square while the mastaka is circular the main temple and the jagamohana differed in size decorative themes and design it was the main temple s trunk called the gandhi in medieval hindu architecture texts that was ruined long ago the sanctum of the main temple is now without a roof and most of the original parts on the east side of the main temple is the nata mandira lit dance temple it stands on a high intricately carved platform the relief on the platform is similar in style to that found on the surviving walls of the temple according to historical texts there was an aruna stambha lit aruna s pillar between the main temple and the nata mandira but it is no longer there because it was moved to the jagannatha at puri sometime during the troubled history of this temple according to harle the texts suggest that originally the complex was enclosed within a wall feet m by feet m with gateways on three sides the sun temple was made from three types of stone chlorite was used for the door lintel and frames as well as some sculptures laterite was used for the core of the platform and staircases near the foundation khondalite was used for other parts of the temple according to mitra the khondalite stone weathers faster over time and this may have contributed to erosion and accelerated the damage when parts of the temples were destroyed none of these stones occur naturally nearby and the architects and artisans must have procured and moved the stones from distant sources probably using the rivers and water channels near the site the masons then created ashlar wherein the stones were polished and finished so as to make joints hardly visible the original temple had a main sanctum sanctorum vimana which is estimated to have been feet m tall the main vimana fell in the main mandapa audience hall jagamohana which is about feet m tall still stands and is the principal structure in the surviving ruins among the structures that have survived to the current day are the dance hall nata mandira and the dining hall bhoga mandapa the walls of the temple from the temple s base through the crowning elements are ornamented with reliefs many finished to jewelry quality miniature details the terraces contain stone statues of male and female musicians holding various musical instruments including the vina mardala gini other major works of art include sculptures of hindu deities apsaras and images from the daily life and culture of the people artha and dharma scenes various animals aquatic creatures birds legendary creatures and friezes narrating the hindu texts the carvings include purely decorative geometric patterns and plant motifs some panels show images from the life of the king such as one showing him receiving counsel from a guru where the artists symbolically portrayed the king as much smaller than the guru with the king s sword resting on the ground next to him the upana moulding layer at the bottom of the platform contains friezes of elephants marching soldiers musicians and images depicting the secular life of the people including hunting scenes a caravan of domesticated animals people carrying supplies on their head or with the help of a bullock cart travelers preparing a meal along the roadside and festive processions on other walls are found images depicting the daily life of the elite as well as the common people for example girls are shown wringing their wet hair standing by a tree looking from a window playing with pets putting on makeup while looking into a mirror playing musical instruments such as the vina chasing away a monkey who is trying to snatch items a family taking leave of their elderly grandmother who seems dressed for a pilgrimage a mother blessing her son a teacher with students a yogi during a standing asana a warrior being greeted with a namaste a mother with her child an old woman with a walking stick and a bowl in her hands comical characters among others the konark temple is also known for its erotic sculptures of maithunas these show couples in various stages of courtship and intimacy and in some cases coital themes notorious in the colonial era for their uninhibited celebration of sexuality these images are included with other aspects of human life as well as deities that are typically associated with tantra this led some to propose that the erotic sculptures are linked to the vama marga left hand tantra tradition however this is not supported by local literary sources and these images may be the same kama and mithuna scenes found integrated into the art of many hindu temples the erotic sculptures are found on the temple s shikhara and these illustrate all the bandhas mudra forms described in the kamasutra other large sculptures were a part of the gateways of the temple complex these include life size lions subduing elephants elephants subduing demons and horses a major pillar dedicated to aruna called the aruna stambha used to stand in front of the eastern stairs of the porch this too was intricately carved with horizontal friezes and motifs it now stands in front of the jagannatha temple at puri the upper levels and terrace of the konark sun temple contain larger and more significant works of art than the lower level these include images of musicians and mythological narratives as well as sculptures of hindu deities including durga in her mahishasuramardini aspect killing the shape shifting buffalo demon shaktism vishnu in his jagannatha form vaishnavism and shiva as a largely damaged linga shaivism some of the better preserved friezes and sculptures were removed and relocated to museums in europe and major cities of india before the hindu deities are also depicted in other parts of the temple for example the medallions of the chariot wheels of the surya temple as well as the anuratha artwork of the jagamohana show vishnu shiva gajalakshmi parvati krishna narasimha and other divinities also found on the jagamohana are sculptures of vedic deities such as indra agni kubera varuna and dityas the temple follows the traditional style of kalinga architecture it is oriented towards the east so that the first rays of the sunrise strike the main entrance the temple built from khondalite rocks was originally constructed at the mouth of the river chandrabhaga but the waterline has receded since then citation needed the wheels of the temple are sundials which can be used to calculate time accurately to a minute the konark sun temple complex has ruins of many subsidiary shrines and monuments around the main temple some of these include a collection of fallen sculptures can be viewed at the konark archaeological museum which is maintained by the archaeological survey of india the fallen upper portion of the temple is believed to have been studded with many inscriptions konark also referred to in indian texts by the name kainapara was a significant trading port by the early centuries of the common era the current konark temple dates to the th century though evidence suggests that a sun temple was built in the konark area by at least the th century several puranas mention surya worship centers in mundira which may have been the earlier name for konark kalapriya mathura and multan now in pakistan the chinese buddhist pilgrim and traveler hiuen tsang also referred to as xuanzang mentions a port city in odisha named charitra he describes the city as prosperous with five convents and storeyed towers that are very high and carved with saintly figures exquisitely done since he visited india in the th century he could not have been referring to the th century temple but his description suggests either konark or another odisha port city already featuring towering structures with sculptures according to the madala panji there was at one time another temple in the region built by pundara kesari he may have been puranjaya the th century ruler of the somavamshi dynasty the current temple is attributed to narasimhadeva i of the eastern ganga dynasty r ce it is one of the few hindu temples whose planning and construction records written in sanskrit in the odia script have been preserved in the form of palm leaf manuscripts that were discovered in a village in the s and subsequently translated the temple was sponsored by the king and its construction was overseen by shiva samantaraya mahapatra it was built near an old surya temple the sculpture in the older temple s sanctum was re consecrated and incorporated into the newer larger temple this chronology of temple site s evolution is supported by many copper plate inscriptions of the era in which the konark temple is referred to as the great cottage according to james harle the temple as built in the th century consisted of two main structures the dance mandapa and the great temple deul the smaller mandapa is the structure that survives the great deul collapsed sometime in the late th century or after according to harle the original temple must originally have stood to a height of some feet m but only parts of its walls and decorative mouldings remain the temple was in ruins before its restoration speculation continues as to the cause of the destruction of the temple early theories stated that the temple was never completed and collapsed during construction this is contradicted by textual evidence and evidence from inscriptions the kenduli copper plate inscription of ce from the reign of narasimha iv seems to indicate that the temple was not only completed but an active site of worship another inscription states that various deities in the temple were consecrated also suggesting that construction of the temple had been completed a non hindu textual source the akbar era text ain i akbari by abul fazl dated to the th century mentions the konark temple describing it as a prosperous site with a temple that made visitors astonished at its sight with no mention of ruins years later during the reign of the marathas in odisha in the th century a maratha holy man found the temple abandoned and covered in overgrowth the marathas relocated the temple s aruna stambha pillar with aruna the charioteer seated atop it to the lion s gate entrance of the jagannath temple in puri texts from the th century do mention ruins which means the temple was damaged either intentionally or through natural causes sometime between and ce after the sun temple ceased to attract faithful konark became deserted left to disappear in dense forests for years according to thomas donaldson evidence suggests that the damage and the temple s ruined condition can be dated to between the late th century and the early th century from the records of various surveys and repairs found in early th century texts these also record that the temple remained a site of worship in the early th century these records do not state whether the ruins were being used by devotees to gather and worship or part of the damaged temple was still in use for some other purpose in the last quarter of the th century the aruna stambha aruna pillar was removed from the entrance of konark temple and placed at the singha dwara lion s gate of the jagannath temple in puri by a maratha brahmachari named goswain or goswami the pillar made of monolithic chlorite is feet inches m tall and is dedicated to aruna the charioteer of the sun god in the east india marine board requested the governor general of bengal that conservation efforts be undertaken however the only conservation measure put in place at the time was to prohibit further removal of stones from the site lacking structural support the last part of the main temple still standing a small broken curved section collapsed in the main temple is completely lost now the then raja of khurda who had jurisdiction over this region in the early th century removed some stones and sculptures to use in a temple he was building in puri a few gateways and some sculptures were destroyed in the process in the asiatic society of bengal requested that conservation efforts be undertaken but the requests were denied and only measures to prevent vandalism were put in place in the asiatic society of bengal proposed and in attempted to relocate an architrave of the konark temple depicting the navagraha to the indian museum in calcutta this attempt was abandoned as funds had run out in thirteen sculptures were moved to the indian museum local hindu population objected to further damage and removal of temple ruins the government issued orders to respect the local sentiments in when a major excavation was attempted nearby the then lieutenant governor of bengal j a bourdillon ordered the temple to be sealed and filled with sand to prevent the collapse of the jagamohana the mukhasala and nata mandir were repaired by in casuarina and punnang trees were planted facing the sea to provide a buffer against sand laden winds in the mayadevi temple was discovered while removing sand and debris the temple was granted world heritage site status by the unesco in on september the asi started removing the sand from jagamohana which will be completed in three years the necessary support of stainless steel beams will be installed inside the temple and repairs will be carried out sun temple marks the high point of the odisha style of nagara architecture the nobel laureate tagore wrote here the language of stone surpasses the language of human the colonial era reception of the temple ranged from praise to derision andrew sterling the early colonial era administrator and commissioner of cuttack questioned the skill of the th century architects but also wrote that the temple had an air of elegance combined with massiveness in the whole structure which entitles it to no small share of admiration adding that the sculpture had a degree of taste propriety and freedom which would stand a comparison with some of our best specimens of gothic architectural ornament the victorian mindset saw pornography in the artwork of konark and wondered why there was no shame and guilt in this pleasure in filth while alan watts stated that there was no comprehensible reason to separate spirituality from love sex and religious arts according to ernest binfield havell the konark temple is one of the grandest examples of indian sculpture extant adding that they express as much fire and passion as the greatest european art such as that found in venice religion is frequently at the centre of the odia previously orissan cultural expression and konark occupies an important space in it as part of the golden triangle jagannath temple puri and the lingaraja temple of bhubaneswar completing it which represents the pinnacle of odia previously orissan masonry and temple architecture numerous poems stories and novels have been written about konark most of which explore or expand or reinterpret the tragedies inherent in the legends and stories about the temple most recently mohanjit s book of poems kone da suraj which revolves around konark won the kendra sahitya academy award one of the top awards for literature in india for punjabi language the following is a list of notable odia literary works based

 westminster abbey formally titled the collegiate church of saint peter at westminster is a large mainly gothic abbey church in the city of westminster london england just to the west of the palace of westminster it is one of the united kingdom s most notable religious buildings and a burial site for english and later british monarchs since the coronation of william the conqueror in all coronations of english and british monarchs have occurred in westminster abbey sixteen royal weddings have occurred at the abbey since according to a tradition first reported by sulcard in about a church was founded at the site then known as thorney island in the seventh century at the time of mellitus bishop of london construction of the present church began in on the orders of henry iii the church was originally part of a catholic benedictine abbey which was dissolved in it then served as the cathedral of the diocese of westminster until then as a second cathedral of the diocese of london until the abbey was restored to the benedictines by mary i in then in made a royal peculiar a church responsible directly to the sovereign by elizabeth i the abbey is the burial site of more than people usually of prominence in british history at least monarchs eight prime ministers poets laureate actors scientists military leaders and the unknown warrior a late tradition claims that aldrich a young fisherman on the river thames had a vision of saint peter near the site this seems to have been quoted as the origin of the salmon that thames fishermen offered to the abbey in later years a custom still observed annually by the fishmongers company the recorded origins of the abbey date to the s or early s when saint dunstan and king edgar installed a community of benedictine monks on the site between and edward the confessor began rebuilding st peter s abbey to provide himself with a royal burial church it was the first church in england built in the romanesque style the building was completed around and was consecrated on december only a week before edward s death on january a week later he was buried in the church nine years later his wife edith was buried alongside him his successor harold godwinson was probably crowned here although the first documented coronation is that of william the conqueror later the same year the only extant depiction of edward s abbey together with the adjacent palace of westminster is in the bayeux tapestry some of the lower parts of the monastic dormitory an extension of the south transept survive in the norman undercroft of the great school including a door said to come from the previous saxon abbey increased endowments supported a community that increased from a dozen monks during dunstan s time up to as many as eighty monks released from the burdens of spiritual leadership which passed to the reformed cluniac movement after the mid th century and occupied with the administration of great landed properties some of which lay far from westminster the benedictines achieved a remarkable degree of identification with the secular life of their times and particularly with upper class life barbara harvey concludes to the extent that her depiction of daily life provides a wider view of the concerns of the english gentry in the high and late middle ages the abbot and monks being adjacent to the palace of westminster the seat of government from the late th century became a powerful force in the centuries after the norman conquest with the abbot of westminster taking his place in the house of lords in due course the proximity to the palace did not however extend to providing them with high royal connections in social origin the benedictines of westminster were as modest as most of the order the abbot remained lord of the manor of westminster as a town of two to three thousand people grew around it as a consumer and employer on a grand scale the monastery helped fuel the town s economy and relations with the town remained unusually cordial but no enfranchising charter was issued during the middle ages westminster abbey became the coronation site of norman kings but none were buried there until henry iii rebuilt it in the anglo french gothic style as a shrine to venerate king edward the confessor and as a suitably regal setting for his own tomb under the highest gothic nave in england the confessor s shrine subsequently played a great part in his canonization construction began in the first building stage included the entire eastern end the transepts and the easternmost bay of the nave the lady chapel built from around at the extreme eastern end was incorporated into the chevet of the new building but was later replaced this work must have been largely completed by when the second stage began this carried the nave on an additional five bays bringing it to one bay beyond the ritual choir here construction stopped in about a consecration ceremony being held on october of that year but because of henry s death construction did not resume the old romanesque nave remained attached to the new building for over a century until it was pulled down and rebuilt from closely following the original and by now outdated design construction was largely finished by the architect henry yevele in the reign of richard ii henry iii also commissioned the unique cosmati pavement in front of the high altar the pavement was re dedicated by the dean at a service on may after undergoing a major cleaning and conservation programme henry vii added a perpendicular style chapel dedicated to the blessed virgin mary in known as the henry vii chapel or the lady chapel much of the stone came from caen in france caen stone the isle of portland portland stone and the loire valley region of france tuffeau limestone the chapel was finished circa in during the assessment attendant on the dissolution of the monasteries the abbey s annual income was equivalent to in henry viii assumed direct control in and granted the abbey the status of a cathedral by charter in simultaneously issuing letters patent establishing the diocese of westminster by granting the abbey cathedral status henry viii gained an excuse to spare it from the destruction or dissolution which he inflicted on most english abbeys during this period the abbot william benson became dean of the cathedral while the prior and five of the monks were among the twelve canons the westminster diocese was dissolved in but the abbey was recognised in retroactively to as a second cathedral of the diocese of london until the already old expression robbing peter to pay paul may have been given a new lease of life when money meant for the abbey which is dedicated to saint peter was diverted to the treasury of st paul s cathedral the abbey was restored to the benedictines under the catholic mary i but they were again ejected under elizabeth i in in elizabeth re established westminster as a royal peculiar a church of the church of england responsible directly to the sovereign rather than to a diocesan bishop and made it the collegiate church of st peter that is a non cathedral church with an attached chapter of canons headed by a dean in the early th century the abbey hosted two of the six companies of churchmen led by lancelot andrewes dean of westminster who translated the king james version of the bible it suffered damage during the turbulent s when it was attacked by puritan iconoclasts but was again protected by its close ties to the state during the commonwealth period oliver cromwell was given an elaborate funeral there in only to be disinterred in january and posthumously hanged from a gibbet at tyburn the abbey s two western towers were built between and by nicholas hawksmoor constructed from portland stone to an early example of a gothic revival design purbeck marble was used for the walls and the floors although the various tombstones are made of different types of marble images of the abbey prior to the construction of the towers are scarce though the abbey s official website states that the building had towers which had been left unfinished in the medieval period after an earthquake in the top of one of the piers on the north side fell down with the iron and lead that had fastened it several houses fell in and many chimneys were damaged another shock had been felt during the preceding month on november the funeral of george ii was held at the abbey and the king was interred next to his late wife caroline of ansbach he left instructions for the sides of his and his wife s coffins to be removed so that their remains could mingle further rebuilding and restoration occurred in the th century under sir george gilbert scott a narthex a portico or entrance hall for the west front was designed by sir edwin lutyens in the mid th century but was not built on june a bomb planted by suffragettes of the women s social and political union exploded inside the abbey the abbey was busy with visitors with around people in the building at the time of the explosion some were as close as yards m from the bomb and the explosion caused a panic for the exits but no serious injuries were reported the bomb had been packed with nuts and bolts to act as shrapnel the event was part of a campaign of bombing and arson attacks carried out by suffragettes nationwide between and churches were a particular target as it was believed that the church of england was complicit in reinforcing opposition to women s suffrage churches were attacked nationwide between and coincidentally at the time of the explosion the house of commons only yards m away was debating how to deal with the violent tactics of the suffragettes many in the commons heard the explosion and rushed to the scene two days after the westminster abbey bombing a second suffragette bomb was discovered before it could explode in st paul s cathedral the bomb blew off a corner of the coronation chair it also caused the stone of scone to break in half although this was not discovered until when four scottish nationalists broke into the church to steal the stone and return it to scotland westminster suffered minor damage during the blitz on november then on may the westminster abbey precincts and roof were hit by incendiary bombs all the bombs were extinguished by arp wardens except for one bomb which ignited out of reach among the wooden beams and plaster vault of the lantern roof of over the north transept flames rapidly spread and burning beams and molten lead began to fall on the wooden stalls pews and other ecclesiastical fixtures feet m below despite the falling debris the staff dragged away as much furniture as possible before withdrawing finally the lantern

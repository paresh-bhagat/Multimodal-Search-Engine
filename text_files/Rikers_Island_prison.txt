was followed by the anderson zouaves on july the anderson zouaves were commanded by john lafayette riker who was related to the owners of the island the camp of the anderson zouaves was named camp astor in compliment to millionaire john jacob astor jr who provided funding for the army and who appears to have made a significant contribution to the raising of the anderson zouaves in particular with the astor ladies being credited with the manufacture of the zouave uniforms worn by the recruits of this regiment rikers island was subsequently used by numerous other civil war regiments but the name camp astor was specific to the anderson zouaves and did not become a general name for the military encampment on the island in new york city s commission of charities and corrections expressed an interest in purchasing the island for use as a work house any such purchase would have to be approved by the state in january state senator frederick s gibbs introduced a bill in the state senate authorizing the commission to purchase the island in may governor grover cleveland signed a bill authorizing the commissioner of charities and corrections to purchase the island for a sum no greater than at the time the island was within the boundaries of long island city which was located in queens county which was not yet part of new york city and this potential transfer set off squabbling

island city and to queens county on august the commissioner of charities and corrections jacob hess signed a contract purchasing the island from john t wilson a descendant of the ryker family for to wilson and for a title search the city expressed a desire to open a jail for men on rikers island as early as in order to replace their overburdened and dilapidated jail on welfare island now roosevelt island the jail was opened in landfill continued to be added to the island until eventually enlarging the original acre ha island to acres ha this required the permission of the federal government since the expansion extended the island s pier line also acres ha were stripped from rikers to help fill in the new north beach airport which opened in and was later renamed laguardia airport the net expansion of the island enabled the jail facilities to also expand the original penitentiary building completed in was called hdm or the house of detention for men it became a maximum security facility called the james a thomas center and closed due to structural issues in after new york city was banned by the courts in from ocean dumping of garbage much of it ended up on rikers island even though the island already had mountains of garbage to feet tall still it took in million cubic yards of additional refuse more than the amount of dirt displaced by the building of the world trade center since much of the garbage was composed of ash from coal heating and incinerators there were frequent spontaneous phosphorescent fires even in the wintertime in the snow one warden described it in at night it is like a forest of christmas trees first one little light then another until the whole hillside is lit up with little fires it was beautiful the island was also plagued with rats which at one point were so prevalent that after poison gas poison bait ferocious dogs and pigs failed to control them one new yorker tried to organize a hunting party to kill them off it was the efforts of master builder robert moses who did not want the unsightly island to be the backdrop for his carefully landscaped world s fair to get the island cleaned up and have the city s garbage sent elsewhere ultimately to the fresh kills landfill on staten island during mayor david dinkins term as mayor of new york the jail filled to overflowing and an bed barge was installed on the east river to accommodate the extra inmates the barge is called the vernon c bain correctional center vcbc and is also known simply as the boat vcbc is located at halleck st bronx ny at the end of hunts point near the recently relocated fulton fish market the keel for the vernon c bain was laid in at the avondale shipyard in new orleans upon completion vcbc was towed up from louisiana to its current mooring and attached to two crandall arms it opened for use as a facility in originally it had been leased to the nyc department of juvenile justice while spofford juvenile center was under reconstruction vcbc was formerly known as maritime facility mtf facilities and were reconstructed british military transport barges or bibbys british industries boat building yard used during the falklands war both of which could house soldiers but only inmates after their conversion mtfs and were anchored on either side of manhattan at east river pier near th street in the hudson river in addition there were two smaller s era staten island ferry boats both converted to house inmates each the ferry boats were sold for salvage around and the owner of the shipyard that built vcbc avondale shipyard bought the two bibbys vcbc is the only vessel of its type in the world prior to modification for use by new york city it cost million to construct the initial plan for acquiring the vessel because of the way new york city makes capital purchases had to begin at least five years before the keel was laid during the tenure of ed koch rikers is close to the runways of laguardia airport on february northeast airlines flight crashed onto rikers island shortly after departing laguardia airport killing and injuring out of a total of passengers and crew after the crash department personnel

adapt and the executive director yolanda serrano the prison granted early release to terminal hiv positive inmates so that they could die peacefully in their own homes the prison housed juvenile inmates until the move was prompted by a law passed by new york state in requiring that juvenile inmates under be housed separately from adults in february the independent commission on new york city criminal justice and incarceration reform also known as the lippman commission since it is chaired by former chief judge of the state of new york jonathan lippman was convened by new york city council speaker melissa mark viverito to review the entirety of the city s criminal justice system in april of that year glenn e martin launched a campaign that called for the closure of the rikers island jail complex in september the campaign organized a march from queens plaza to the rikers island bridge to send a message to former mayor bill de blasio that new york city is united in demanding the jail complex be closed in the months following there had been plans to build an additional facility on the island that consisted of beds in november new york city department of correction commissioner joseph ponte said as we look at construction and now with the kind of the movement to close rikers all those things politically have to be taken into consideration so the bed facility on rikers is still at at a kind of pause right now after a year of consideration the lippmann commission released a report of recommendations for closing the jail complex de blasio did not specifically endorse the findings of the commission and it is expected to provide the broad outline of the plan to close rikers when it was announced the lippman commission proposed a year plan to close the ten jails currently on the island and replace them with smaller jails one in each borough closer to the courthouses the population at rikers island would have to decrease from current average of to approximately according to the mayor s office of criminal justice key strategies in shrinking the rikers population has included addressing causes of case delays identifying individuals that could be granted alternatives to jail time and improving programming and discharge services since the rikers population has dropped by more than when the average daily population was the intention to close the prison complex within years was endorsed by former mayor bill de blasio on march after the new york post leaked the findings of the lippman commission one possible reuse proposal was to build a low rise residential development although the island s distance from mass transit proximity to laguardia airport and leakage of toxic methane gas from its landfill base would pose problems for the proposed development it would also mean that each residential unit would cost about twice as much to construct as a normal unit in new york city the residential development would connect the island to the mainland for the expansion of the airport using it as a park for solid waste management or for manufacturing however the commission specifically ruled out its use for private residences in light of possible closure of the jail complex new york city public advocate letitia james suggested renaming the island after kalief browder an inmate who committed suicide after being jailed at rikers on june former mayor de blasio released his plan for a year shutdown of the facility saying that it was not a quick fix this will be a long a difficult path he wrote the city will reduce the inmate population of rikers through the use of alternative facilities and reforms such as making the payment of bail easier and improving mental health facilities and programs two diversion centers will assist people with mental health problems and will work with police to find options other than incarceration smaller jail facilities will be open throughout the city but the plan does not fully describe how where and when that will occur the new york state commission of correction which oversees new york city s jails issued a report in february citing numerous violations in the facility on the part of the city and a significant increase in violent incidents from to it suggested that the state might move to close rikers island before the city s year deadline which is not legally binding on october the city council voted for an over billion plan to close the rikers island prisons and other new york city jails by and replace them with four borough based jails new prisons are planned but council members said that a move from arrests to tickets not prosecuting misdemeanors and a state law set to eliminate cash bail for misdemeanors would reduce the need for jails rikers island has become notorious in recent years for a culture of abuse and has been subject to a number of investigations and rulings in a federal appeals court ruled that strip searches could not be performed on people arrested on misdemeanor charges like fare evasion on the subway or marijuana smoking the case itself was brought by ann weber who was arrested for making an inflated claim on a call after her son was attacked while leaving her daughter s wedding she was brought to jail still dressed in formal wedding attire locked in a cell and forced to strip and expose her cavities for search in the hour it took for her daughter to arrive and post bail prior to this decision all prisoners taken to rikers no matter the level of their accusation were strip searched these searches often took place in groups of to and involved genital and anal searches despite the court s ruling the practice lived on costing new york city taxpayers a total of million in settlements to the victims of these illegal searches in a ruling was reached in new york reinforcing the illegality of strip searches for misdemeanor detainees and demanding that the city pay up to million to the tens of thousands of people who were illegally searched over the years however the practice did not die another suit was filed against the city in for performing strip searches on inmates taken to rikers on misdemeanor charges on october the new york city department of corrections conceded that tens of thousands of nonviolent inmates taken to rikers island on misdemeanor charges had been wrongly strip searched in violation of a court settlement and were entitled to payment for damages the policy was kept in place despite a united states court of appeals for the second circuit ruling in that strip searches of misdemeanor suspects were illegal unless officials suspected that they were carrying contraband lead lawyer richard d emery charged in his papers that department officials repeatedly resorted to lying to cover up deliberate indifference to the continued practice of humiliating detainees by forcing them to strip naked in groups this class action suit won million in damages in february correctional officer lloyd nicholson was indicted after he allegedly used a select group of teenage inmates as enforcers under a regime called the program as well as allegedly beating inmates himself however the program has been known to exist for well over a decade and is unique to the adolescents the inmates use it as a test for other inmates and a system of control amongst themselves a village voice article lists a roll call of scandals at rikers including the case of officers who allegedly passed accused cop killer lee woods marijuana cigarettes and alcohol the february indictment of correctional officer lloyd nicholson who used inmates as enforcers and the april suicide of year old steven morales who allegedly killed his infant daughter in the high security closed custody unit on february the new york times reported that the pattern of cases suggests that city correctional officials have been aware of a problem in which rikers guards have acquiesced or encouraged violence among inmates the times added that there have been at least seven lawsuits filed in federal district court in manhattan accusing guards of complicity or acquiescence in inmate violence at rikers a complex of detention facilities which along with several other jails around the city hold about prisoners most of whom are pretrial detainees none of the seven suits has gone to trial in the three that were settled the city admitted no liability or wrongdoing in an alleged july rape case reported by the village voice on august the alleged victim claimed that someone entered her cell in the bed rose m singer center while she was asleep sometime before a m on july she says the intruder or intruders bound and gagged her with bedsheets and then used a dildo like object to sexually assault her other inmates may have acted as lookouts during the alleged assault the woman who was being held on grand larceny charges for the past three months was discovered at about a m by an officer and a captain who were touring the building the officer saw her lying on her back on the floor of her cell with bedsheets wrapped around her neck mouth and legs she had also been blindfolded the incident was reported to central command at a m and the woman was transported to the elmhurst hospital center because she didn t share a cell with anyone a major question is how the alleged assault happened in the first place officials won t talk about the investigation and there s no word on whether any arrests have been made on june captain sherman graham and assistant deputy warden gail lewis were arrested by the new york city department of investigation doi for covering up an assault on an inmate the arrest came after both were indicted by a bronx grand jury it is alleged that on october graham assaulted an inmate after he refused to comply with strip searching procedures at the robert n davoren center rndc c the assault occurred in front of correctional academy recruits in training after the assault graham ordered the recruits to write on their use of force witness reports that graham assaulted the inmate in self defense after the inmate punched graham lewis who was graham s supervisor did not intervene to stop the attack lewis also submitted a false use of force witness report charges against graham include counts of falsifying business records counts of offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree counts of official misconduct a class a misdemeanor and one count of attempted assault in the third degree lewis was charged with falsifying business records offering a

in october for being held for three years on rikers island without a trial in june browder died by suicide by hanging the conditions of his detention were widely seen as having caused his mental condition he had multiple prior suicide attempts while incarcerated days after his death u s supreme court justice anthony kennedy invoked browder s experience in his opinion on davis v ayala on january president barack obama wrote an article in the washington post criticizing the overuse of solitary confinement in american jails basing his arguments largely on browder s case he signed an executive order banning solitary confinement of juveniles in federal prisons since mayor de blasio has begun to take action against the abuse by adding surveillance cameras and improving care for mentally ill prisoners on september judge tynia richard offered a sharp rebuke to the department of corrections recommending that six correctional officers be fired this group led by captain budnarine behari had participated in the brutal beating of robert hinton a mentally ill inmate while he was hog tied because he had protested being moved from his cell by sitting down hinton s fellow inmates watched as he was dragged down the hallways while hog tied to a solitary confinement cell where he was beaten while this ruling was one of the most severe against the department of corrections in many

segregated unit at rikers for lgbt prisoners known as gay housing was closed in december citing a need to improve security the unit had opened in the s due to concerns about abuse of lgbt prisoners in pretrial detention the new york city department of correction s widely criticized plan was to restructure the classification of prisoners and create a new protective custody system which would include

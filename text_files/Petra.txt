petra arabic romanized al batr ancient greek rock nabataean originally known to its inhabitants as raqmu or raq m is an historic and archaeological city in southern jordan it is adjacent to the mountain of jabal al madbah in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the arabah valley running from the dead sea to the gulf of aqaba the area around petra has been inhabited from as early as bc and the nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the th century bc archaeological work has only discovered evidence of nabataean presence dating back to the second century bc by which time petra had become their capital the nabataeans were nomadic arabs who invested in petra s proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub the trading business gained the nabataeans considerable revenue and petra became the focus of their wealth the nabataeans were accustomed to living in the barren deserts unlike their enemies and were able to repel attacks by taking advantage of the area s mountainous terrain they were particularly skillful in harvesting rainwater agriculture and stone carving petra flourished in the st century ad when its al khazneh structure believed to be the mausoleum of nabataean king aretas iv was constructed and its population peaked at an estimated inhabitants although the nabataean kingdom became a client state of the roman empire in the first century bc it was only in ad that it lost its independence petra fell to the romans who annexed nabataea and renamed it as arabia petraea petra s importance declined as sea trade routes emerged and after an earthquake in destroyed many structures in the byzantine era several christian churches were built but the city continued to decline and by the early islamic era it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads it remained unknown until it was rediscovered in by johann ludwig burckhardt access to the city is through a kilometre long mi gorge called the siq which leads directly to the khazneh famous for its rock cut architecture and water conduit system petra is also called the rose city because of the colour of the stone from which it is carved it has been a unesco world heritage site since unesco has described petra as one of the most precious cultural properties of man s cultural heritage in al khazneh was voted one of the new wonders of the world petra is a symbol of jordan as well as jordan s most visited tourist attraction tourist numbers peaked at million in marking the first time that the figure rose above the million mark tourism in the city was crippled by the covid pandemic but soon after started to pick up again reaching visitors in pliny the elder and other writers identify petra as the capital of the nabataean kingdom and the centre of their caravan trade enclosed by towering rocks and watered by a perennial stream petra not only possessed the advantages of a fortress but controlled the main commercial routes which passed through it to gaza in the west to bosra and damascus in the north to aqaba and leuce come on the red sea and across the desert to the persian gulf excavations have demonstrated that it was the ability of the nabataeans to control the water supply that led to the rise of the desert city creating an artificial oasis the area is visited by flash floods but archaeological evidence shows that the nabataeans controlled these floods by the use of dams cisterns and water conduits these innovations stored water for prolonged periods of drought and enabled the city to prosper from its sale in ancient times petra might have been approached from the south on a track leading across the plain of petra around jabal haroun aaron s mountain the location of the tomb of aaron said to be the burial place of aaron brother of moses another approach was possibly from the high plateau to the north today most modern visitors approach the site from the east the impressive eastern entrance leads steeply down through a dark narrow gorge in places only m ft wide called the siq shaft a natural geological feature formed from a deep split in the sandstone rocks and serving as a waterway flowing into wadi musa one of the main things that petra is known for is its hellenistic architecture the facades of the tombs in petra display this type of architecture and it also grants reflection on the different types of cultures that the nabataens traded with most of these contain small burials and niches that are carved into the stone perhaps a more prominent resemblance to the hellenistic style comes with its treasury which is meters ft wide and meters ft tall and gives reference to the architecture of alexandria the facade of the treasury features a broken pediment with a central tholos inside and two obelisks appear to form into the rock at the top near the bottom of the treasury there are twin greek gods castor and pollux who protect travellers on their journeys near the top of the treasury two victories are seen standing on each side of a female figure on the tholos this female figure is believed to be the isis tyche isis being the egyptian goddess and tyche being the greek goddess of good fortune another prime example of the hellenistic architecture featured in petra is in its monastery which stands at meters ft tall and meters ft wide this is petra s largest monument and is another building carved into the rocks of petra the facade of this again features a broken pediment similar to the treasury as well as another central tholos the monastery displays more of a nabataen touch while at the same time incorporating elements from greek architecture its only source of light is its entrance standing at meters ft high there is a large space outside of the monastery which is purposefully flattened for worship purposes formerly in the byzantine period this was a place for christian worship but is now a holy site for pilgrims to visit at the end of the narrow gorge the siq stands petra s most elaborate ruin popularly known as al khazneh the treasury hewn into the sandstone cliff while remaining in remarkably preserved condition the face of the structure is marked by hundreds of bullet holes made by the local bedouin tribes that hoped to dislodge riches that were once rumoured to be hidden within it a little farther from the treasury at the foot of the mountain called en nejr is a massive theatre positioned so as to bring the greatest number of tombs within view at the point where the valley opens out into the plain the site of the city is revealed with striking effect the theatre was cut into the hillside and into several of the tombs during its construction rectangular gaps in the seating are still visible almost enclosing it on three sides are rose coloured mountain walls divided into groups by deep fissures and lined with knobs cut from the rock in the form of towers the theatre was said to hold around people the performances that audiences were able to attend here were poetry readings and dramas gladiator fights were also said to be held here and attracted the most audience although no gladiator was able to gain any momentum or fame due to the heavy mortality rate that came with it the theatre was one of many structures in petra that took significant damage due to the galilee earthquake the petra pool and garden complex is a series of structures within the city center originally said to be a market area excavations at the site have allowed scholars to identify it as an elaborate nabataean garden which included a large swimming pool an island pavilion and an intricate hydraulic system ahead of the petra pool and garden complex lies colonnaded street which is among few artifacts of petra that was constructed rather than natural this street used to hold a semi circle nymphaeum which is now in ruins due to flash flooding and used to hold petra s only tree this was intended to be a symbol for the peaceful atmosphere that the nabataens were able to construct in petra once the romans took control of the city colonnaded street was narrowed to make room for a side walk and columns were added to each side the high place of sacrifice is located at the top of jebel madbah mountain the beginning of the hike is near petra s theatre from there the site of the high place of sacrifice is around an step hike one commonly believed sacrifice that took place there was libation another common form of sacrifice that took place there was animal sacrifice this is due to the belief that the tomb of the prophet aaron is located in petra which is a sacred site for muslims in honor of this a goat was sacrificed annually other rituals also took place there including the smoking of frankincense the royal tombs of petra embody the unique artistry of the nabateans while also giving display to hellenistic architecture but the fa ades of these tombs have worn due to natural decay one of these tombs the palace tomb is speculated to be the tomb for the kings of petra the corinthian tomb which is right next to the palace tomb has the same hellenistic architecture featured on the treasury the two other royal tombs are the silk tomb and the urn tomb the silk tomb does not stand out as much as the urn tomb the urn tomb features a large yard in its front and was turned into a church after the expansion of christianity in ad in archaeologists using satellite imagery and drones discovered a very large previously unknown monumental structure whose beginnings were tentatively dated to about bc the time when the nabataeans initiated their public building programme it is located outside the main area of the city at the foot of jabal an nmayr and about mi km south of the city centre but is facing east not towards the city and has no visible relationship to it the structure consists of a huge by ft by m platform with a monumental staircase along its eastern side the large platform enclosed a slightly smaller one topped with a comparatively small building by ft by m which was facing east toward the staircase the structure second in size only to the monastery complex probably had a ceremonial function of which not even a speculative explanation has yet been offered by the researchers in petra there is a semi arid climate most rain falls in the winter the k ppen geiger climate classification is bsk the average annual temperature in petra is c f about mm in of precipitation falls annually by bc some of the earliest recorded farmers had settled in beidha a pre pottery neolithic settlement just north of petra petra is listed in egyptian campaign accounts and the amarna letters as pel sela or seir citation needed the iron age lasted between and bc in that time the petra area was occupied by the edomites this came when the edomites rebelled after the death of king solomon in bc when israel split into two kingdoms for israel to be in the north and judah in the south the edomites were known as descendents of esau and this was referenced in the old testament of the bible the configuration of mountains in petra allowed for a reservoir of water for the edomites this made petra a stopping ground for merchants making it an outstanding area for trade things that were traded here included wines olive oil and wood initially the edomites were accompanied by nomads who eventually left but the edomites stayed and made their mark on petra before the emergence of the nabataens they were then engaged in battle with king amaziah of judah and chased back into their own lands it is said that men were thrown off of the mountain umm el biyara this story has been debated by scholars the edomite site excavated at the top of the umm el biyara mountain at petra was established no earlier than the seventh century bc iron ii the nabataeans were one among several nomadic bedouin tribes that roamed the arabian desert and moved with their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water although the nabataeans were initially embedded in aramaic culture theories about them having aramean roots are rejected by many modern scholars instead archaeological religious and linguistic evidence confirm that they are a northern arabian tribe current evidence suggests that the nabataean name for petra was raq m variously spelled in inscriptions as rqmw or rqm the jewish historian josephus ca ad writes that the region was inhabited by the midianites during the time of moses and that they were ruled by five kings one of whom was rekem josephus mentions that the city called petra by the greeks ranks highest in the land of the arabs and was still called rekeme by all the arabs of his time after its royal founder antiquities iv the onomasticon of eusebius also identified rekem as petra arabic raqama means to mark to decorate so rekeme could be a nabataean word referring to the famous carved rock fa ades in workmen clearing rubble away from the cliff at the entrance to the gorge found several funerary inscriptions in nabatean script one of them was to a certain petraios who was born in raqmu rekem and buried in garshu jerash an old theory held that petra might be identified with a place called sela in the hebrew bible encyclop dia britannica states that the semitic name of the city if not sela would remain unknown it nevertheless cautioned that sela simply means rock in hebrew and thence might not be identified with a city where it occurs in the biblical text in the book of obadiah it is possible that the city was part of the nation of edom the passage in diodorus siculus xix which describes the expeditions which antigonus sent against the nabataeans in bc was understood by some researchers and not so by others to throw some light upon the history of petra but the petra greek for rock referred to as a natural fortress and place of refuge cannot be a proper name and the description implies that there was no town in existence there at the time in ad when cornelius palma was governor of syria the part of arabia under the rule of petra was absorbed into the roman empire as part of arabia petraea and petra became its capital the native dynasty came to an end but the city continued to flourish under roman rule it was around this time that the petra roman road was built a century later in the time of alexander severus when the city was at the height of its splendor the issue of coinage came to an end there was no more building of sumptuous tombs owing apparently to some sudden catastrophe such as an invasion by the neo persian power under the sassanid empire meanwhile as palmyra fl grew in importance and attracted the arabian trade away from petra the latter declined it appears however to have lingered on as a religious centre another roman road was constructed at the site epiphanius of salamis c writes that in his time a feast was held there on december in honour of the virgin khaabou chaabou and her offspring dushara dushara and al uzza were two of the main deities of the city which otherwise included many idols from other nabataean deities such as allat and manat between and trajan built the via traiana nova running from the syrian border to the red sea through petra this road followed the old routes of nabataean caravans in the shadow of the pax romana this route revived trade between arabia syria and mediterranean harbors in ad one of emperor hadrian s administrators left marks dubious discuss in petra pointed out by documents found at the dead sea in ad hadrian visited the former nabataean capital giving it the name of hadri n petra metropolis imprinted on his coins his visit however did not lead to any boom in development and new buildings as it did in jerash the province s governor sextius florentinus erected a monumental mausoleum for his son near the end of the al hubta king s wall tombs which had been generally reserved during the nabataean period for the royal family the interest that roman emperors showed for the city in the rd century suggests that petra and its environs remained highly esteemed for a long time an inscription to liber pater a god revered by emperor septimius severus was found in the temenos of the temple known as qasr al bint and nabataean tombs contained silver coins with the emperor s portrait as well as pottery from his reign emperor elagabalus declared petra to be a roman colony when he reorganised the roman empire towards the end of the rd century the area from petra to wadi mujib the negev and the sinai peninsula were annexed into the province of palaestina salutaris petra may be seen on the madaba mosaic map from the reign of emperor justinian petra declined rapidly under roman rule in large part from the revision of sea based trade routes in an earthquake destroyed many buildings and crippled the vital water management system the old city of petra was the capital of the byzantine province of palaestina iii and many churches from the byzantine period were excavated in and around petra in one of them the byzantine church papyri were discovered which contained mainly contracts dated from s to s establishing that the city was still flourishing in the th century the byzantine church is a prime example of monumental architecture in byzantine petra the last reference to byzantine petra comes from the spiritual meadow of john moschus written in the first decades of the th century he gives an anecdote about its bishop athenogenes it ceased to be a metropolitan bishopric sometime before when that function had been transferred to areopolis petra is not mentioned in the narratives of the muslim conquest of the levant nor does it appear in any early islamic records in the th century the crusaders built fortresses such as the alwaeira castle but were forced to abandon petra after a while as a result the location of petra was lost until the th century two further crusader period castles are known in and around petra the first is al wu ayra situated just north of wadi musa it can be viewed from the road to little petra it is the castle which was seized by a band of turks with the help of local muslims and only recovered by the crusaders after they began to destroy the olive trees of wadi musa the potential loss of livelihood led the locals to negotiate surrender the second is on the summit of el habis in the heart of petra and can be accessed from the west side of the qasr al bint the ruins of petra were an object of curiosity during the middle ages and were visited by baibars one of the first mamluk sultans of egypt towards the end of the th century the first european to describe them was the swiss traveller johann ludwig burckhardt during his travels in at that time the greek church of jerusalem operated a diocese in al karak named battra in arabic and in greek and it was the opinion among the clergy of jerusalem that kerak was the ancient city of petra burckhardt already spoke arabic fluently and was on his way to explore the niger river when he heard stories of a dead city that held the tomb of the prophet aaron he then became fascinated with finding the city he then dressed himself up as a local and only spoke in arabic bringing a goat with him with the intent of sacrificing it in honor of aaron s tomb after one day of exploring he was convinced that he had found the lost city of petra l on de laborde and louis maurice adolphe linant de bellefonds made the first accurate drawings of petra in the scottish painter david roberts visited petra in and returned to england with sketches and stories of the encounter with local tribes published in the holy land syria idumea arabia egypt and nubia frederic edwin church the leading american landscape painter of the th century visited petra in and the resulting painting el khasn petra is among his most important and well documented missionary archibald forder published photographs of petra in the december issue of national geographic because the structures weakened with age many of the tombs became vulnerable to thieves and many treasures were stolen in a four person team consisting of british archaeologists agnes conway and george horsfield palestinian physician and folklore expert dr tawfiq canaan and dr ditlef nielsen a danish scholar excavated and surveyed petra the archaeologist philip hammond from the university of utah visited petra for nearly years he explained that the local folklore says it was created by the wand of moses when he struck the rock to bring forth water for the israelites hammond believed the carved channels deep within the walls and ground were made from ceramic pipes that once fed water for the city from rock cut systems on the canyon rim numerous scrolls in greek and dating to the byzantine period were discovered in an excavated church near the temple of the winged lions in petra in december the nabataeans worshipped arab gods and goddesses during the pre islamic era as well as a few of their deified kings one obodas i was deified after his death dushara was the primary male god accompanied by his three female deities al uzz allat and man t many statues carved in the rock depict these gods and goddesses new evidence indicates that broader edomite and nabataean theology had strong links to earth sun relationships often manifested in the orientation of prominent petra structures to equinox and solstice sunrises and sunsets a stele dedicated to qos allah qos is allah or qos the god by qosmilk melech king is found at petra glueck qos is identifiable with kaush qaush the god of the older edomites the stele is horned and the seal from the edomite tawilan near petra identified with kaush displays a star and crescent browning both consistent with a moon deity it is conceivable that the latter could have resulted from trade with harran bartlett there is continuing debate about the nature of qos qaus bow who has been identified both with a hunting bow hunting god and a rainbow weather god although the crescent above the stele is also a bow citation needed nabataean inscriptions in sinai and other places display widespread references to names including allah el and allat god and goddess with regional references to al uzza baal and manutu manat negev allat is also found in sinai in south arabian language allah occurs particularly as garm allahi god decided greek garamelos and aush allahi gods covenant greek ausallos we find both shalm lahi allah is peace and shalm allat the peace of the goddess we also find amat allahi she servant of god and halaf llahi the successor of allah recently petra has been put forward as the original mecca by some in the revisionist school of islamic studies owing to claims of large numbers of independent pieces of evidence citation needed namely that the early original mosques faced petra not jerusalem or mecca as the direction of muslim prayer the qibla however others have challenged the notion of comparing modern readings of qiblah directions to early mosques qiblahs as they claim early muslims could not accurately calculate the direction of the qiblah to mecca and so the apparent pinpointing of petra by some early mosques may well be coincidental the monastery petra s largest monument dates from the st century bc it was dedicated to obodas i and is believed to be the symposium of obodas the god this information is inscribed on the ruins of the monastery the name is the translation of the arabic ad deir citation needed the temple of the winged lions is a large temple complex dated to the reign of king aretas iv bc ad the temple is located in petra s so called sacred quarter an area situated at the end of petra s main colonnaded street consisting of two majestic temples the qasr al bint and opposite the temple of the winged lions on the northern bank of wadi musa christianity found its way to petra in the th century ad nearly years after the establishment of petra as a trade centre the start of christianity in petra started primarily in ad when the first christian emperor of rome took over constantine i otherwise known as constantine the great he began the initial spread of christianity throughout the roman empire athanasius mentions a bishop of petra anhioch named asterius at least one of the tombs the tomb with the urn was used as a church an inscription in red paint records its consecration in the time of the most holy bishop jason after the islamic conquest of christianity in petra as of most of arabia gave way to islam during the first crusade petra was occupied by baldwin i of the kingdom of jerusalem and formed the second fief of the barony of al karak in the lordship of oultrejordain with the title ch teau de la val e de moyse or sela it remained in the hands of the franks until it is still a titular see of the catholic church according to arab tradition petra is the spot where musa moses struck a rock with his staff and water came forth and where moses brother harun aaron is buried at mount hor known today as jabal haroun or mount aaron the wadi musa or wadi of moses is the arab name for the narrow valley at the head of which petra is sited a mountaintop shrine of moses sister miriam was still shown to pilgrims at the time of jerome in the th century but its location has not been identified since the bidoul bidul petra bedouin were forcibly resettled from their cave dwellings in petra to umm sayhoun um seihun by the jordanian government in prior to the unesco designation process citation needed they were provided with block built housing with some infrastructure including in particular a sewage and drainage system among the six communities in the petra region umm sayhoun is one of the smaller communities the village of wadi musa is the largest in the area inhabited largely by the layathnah bedouin and is now the closest settlement to the visitor centre the main entrance via the siq and the archaeological site generally umm sayhoun gives access to the back route into the site the wadi turkmaniyeh pedestrian route on december petra was designated a world heritage site in a popular poll in it was also named one of the new wonders of the world the petra archaeological park pap became an autonomous legal entity over the management of this site in august the bidouls belong to one of the bedouin tribes whose cultural heritage and traditional skills were proclaimed by unesco on the intangible cultural heritage list in and inscribed in in following an month project planning phase the petra development and tourism region authority in association with designworkshop and jcp s r l published a strategic master plan that guides planned development of the petra region this is intended to guide planned development of the petra region in an efficient balanced and sustainable way over the next years for the benefit of the local population and of jordan in general as part of this a strategic plan was developed for umm sayhoun and surrounding areas the process of developing the strategic plan considered the area s needs from five points of view the site suffers from a host of threats including collapse of ancient structures erosion from flooding and improper rainwater drainage weathering from salt upwelling improper restoration of ancient structures and unsustainable tourism the last has increased substantially especially since the site received widespread media coverage in during the new wonders of the world internet and cellphone campaign in an attempt to reduce the impact of these threats the petra national trust pnt was established in it has worked with numerous local and international organisations on projects that promote the protection conservation and preservation of the petra site moreover unesco and icomos recently collaborated to publish their first book on human and natural threats to the sensitive world heritage sites they chose petra as its first and the most important example of threatened landscapes the presentation tourism and archaeological heritage management at petra driver to development or destruction was the first in a series to address the very nature of these deteriorating buildings cities sites and regions people for the ethical treatment of animals peta released a video in highlighting abuse against working animals in petra peta claimed that animals are forced to carry tourists or pull carriages every day the video showed handlers beating and whipping working animals with beatings intensifying when animals faltered peta also revealed some wounded animals including camels with fly infested open wounds the jordanian authority running the site responded by proposing a veterinarian clinic and by spreading awareness among animal handlers in more video released by peta indicated that conditions for the animals had not improved and in the organization was running what appeared to be the only veterinary clinic in the area petra is a site at the intersection of natural and cultural heritage forming a unique cultural landscape ever since johann ludwig burckhardt aka sheikh ibrahim had re discovered the ruin city in petra jordan in the cultural heritage site has attracted different people who shared an interest in the ancient history and culture of the nabataeans such as travellers pilgrims painters and savants however it was not until the late th century that the ruins were systematically approached by archaeological researchers since then regular archaeological excavations and ongoing research on the nabataean culture have been part of today s unesco world cultural heritage site petra through the excavations in the petra archaeological park an increasing number of nabataean cultural heritage is being exposed to environmental impact a central issue is the management of water impacting the built heritage and the rock hewn facades the large number of discoveries and the exposure of structures and findings demand conservation measures respecting the interlinkage between the natural landscape and cultural heritage as especially this connection is a central challenge at the unecso world heritage site in recent years different conservation campaigns and projects were established at the cultural heritage site of petra the main works first focussed on the entrance situation of the siq to protect tourists and to facilitate access also different projects for conservation and conservation research were conducted following is a list of projects to be continued some of the structures in the petra archaeological

 laguardia airport iata lga icao klga faa lid lga l w rdi is a civil airport in east elmhurst queens new york city covering acres hectares as of august update the facility was established in and began operating as a public airport in it is named after former new york city mayor fiorello la guardia the airport primarily accommodates airline service to domestic and limited international destinations as of update it was the third busiest airport in the new york metropolitan area behind kennedy and newark airports and the twenty first busiest in the united states by passenger volume the airport is located directly to the north of the grand central parkway the airport s primary access highway while the airport is a hub for both american airlines and delta air lines commercial service is strictly governed by unique regulations including a curfew a slot system and a perimeter rule prohibiting most nonstop flights to or from destinations greater than miles km throughout the s and s laguardia was notable for having obsolete and dirty facilities inefficient air operations and poor customer service metrics responding to these criticisms the port authority of new york and new jersey panynj in announced a multibillion dollar reconstruction of the airport s passenger infrastructure which is expected to be complete by prior to human development the coastlines of bowery bay and flushing bay converged at a natural point that comprised the eventual northern shoreline of newtown queens by the area partially contained the estate of benjamin pike jr which was soon purchased and consolidated with other property by william steinway in june steinway opened a summer resort development known as bowery bay beach on the peninsula originally featuring a bathing pavilion beach lawns and boathouse the resort was renamed north beach and later expanded with the addition of gala amusement park by the turn of the century north beach s german influenced development drew comparisons to brooklyn s coney island its fortunes would soon turn however as prohibition in the united states and war related anti german sentiment presented significant challenges to the resort s profitability these factors combined with increased industrialization and pollution of the queens waterfront made the area untenable as a leisure destination and it was abandoned at some point in the s in april new york air terminals inc announced plans to open a private seaplane base at north beach later that summer the acre ha facility was christened on june and initially featured a acre ha concrete plateau connected to the water by a ft m amphibious aircraft ramp with the former resort converted to a passenger terminal opening day festivities for the new airport were attended by a crowd of and included air races with curtiss seagulls and sikorsky flying boats a dedication address by borough president george u harvey and the commencement of airline service to albany and atlantic city by coastal airways and curtiss flying service one month later service to boston was launched using savoia marchetti s aircraft operated by airvia by the airport had been improved with hangars and night illuminated runways and it housed seaplanes of the recently reorganized new york city police department aviation unit on september the site was renamed glenn h curtiss airport in honor of the new york aviation pioneer who had died one month earlier not to be confused with the preexisting curtiss field in nearby garden city nor a similarly renamed airport in valley stream in a ceremony that same day representatives from the forerunner to trans world airlines announced their bid to establish the nation s first transcontinental airmail route to the airport using ford trimotors in attendance were eleanor roosevelt and charles lindbergh on august the airport welcomed the arrival of the world s then largest airplane the dornier do x after a month transatlantic journey over people visited the huge flying boat on its first day of static display and it remained in the city for nine months while the do x was ultimately a commercial failure its presence demonstrated the viability of long distance air travel terminating a mere minute drive from manhattan likewise this centralized location also enabled the airport to host hourly air taxi services between newark and brooklyn s floyd bennett field that september while curtiss field was quickly becoming a magnet of aviation newark airport remained the primary terminal for new york city bound passengers and mail the city s lack of its own central airport lingered as the s wore on especially as discussion grew regarding the commercial viability of privately operated fields the election of mayor fiorello la guardia ushered in a new era of public investment in new york city s airports mayor laguardia had been a long time aviation advocate in a editorial penned while serving as a us representative of new york he criticized both the federal and state governments slow progress in establishing municipal airports in the city although several potential sites had been identified laguardia mainly pushed for the transformation of governors island into a combined airport and seaplane base no greater monument to the life and activity of the republic can be imagined he wrote painting it as a teeming transportation hub at the extreme center of the city military and shipping concerns eventually shut down the proposal but laguardia and industry leaders maintained consensus that new york city needed a central express airport to complement the farther flung floyd bennett field which it completed in while the governors island proposal was being litigated laguardia also saw development potential in curtiss airport under his administration the city entered a year contract with its owners agreeing to lease the field for per year with an option to purchase the property for equivalent to in the airport was officially dedicated municipal airport on january at a key ceremony that day laguardia also received a signed lease from twa for hangar space at floyd bennett field making it the first major us airline to serve new york city directly while it would still be years before twa arrived at north beach laguardia had begun fulfilling one of his ultimate goals extracting new york city from the humiliating position of seeing all its passengers and mail traffic go to a nearby state the initiative to develop the airport for commercial flights began with an outburst by new york mayor fiorello la guardia in office from to upon the arrival of his twa flight at newark airport the only commercial airport serving the new york city region at the time as his ticket said new york he demanded to be taken to new york and ordered the plane to be flown to brooklyn s floyd bennett field giving an impromptu press conference to reporters along the way he urged new yorkers to support a new airport within their city american airlines accepted laguardia s offer to start a trial program of scheduled flights to floyd bennett although the program failed after several months because newark s airport was closer to manhattan la guardia went as far as to offer police escorts to airport limousines in an attempt to get american airlines to continue operating the trial program during the floyd bennett experiment laguardia and american executives began an alternative plan to build a new airport in queens where it could take advantage of the new queens midtown tunnel to manhattan the existing north beach airport was an obvious location but much too small for the sort of airport that was being planned with backing and assistance from the works progress administration construction began in it is on the waterfront of flushing and bowery bays in east elmhurst and borders the neighborhoods of astoria and jackson heights building on the site required moving landfill from rikers island then a garbage dump onto a metal reinforcing framework the framework below the airport still causes magnetic interference on the compasses of outgoing aircraft signs on the airfield warn pilots about the problem because of american s pivotal role in the development of the airport laguardia gave the airline extra real estate during the airport s first year of operation including four hangars which was an unprecedented amount of space at the time american opened its first admirals club and the first private airline club in the world at the airport in the club took over a large office space that had previously been reserved for the mayor but he offered it for lease following criticism from the press and american vice president red mosier immediately accepted the offer the airport was dedicated on october as the new york municipal airport and opened for business on december of that year it cost new york city million to turn the tiny north beach airport into a acre ha modern facility not everyone was as enthusiastic as la guardia about the project some critics regarded it as a million boondoggle but the public was fascinated by the very idea of air travel and thousands traveled to the airport paid the dime fee and watched the airliners take off and land two years later these fees and their associated parking had already provided and other non travel related incomes food etc were another a year the airport was soon a financial success a smaller airport in nearby jackson heights holmes airport was unable to prevent the expansion of the larger airport and closed in citation needed newark airport began renovations but could not keep up with the new queens airport which time called the most pretentious land and seaplane base in the world even before the project was completed laguardia had won commitments from the five largest airlines pan american airways american united eastern air lines and transcontinental and western air to begin using the new field as soon as it opened pan am s transatlantic boeing flying boats moved to la guardia from port washington in during world war ii the airport was used to train aviation technicians and as a logistics field transatlantic landplane airline flights started in late some continued after idlewild now john f kennedy international opened in july but the last ones shifted to idlewild in april newspaper accounts alternately referred to the airfield as new york municipal airport and laguardia field until the modern name was officially applied when the airport moved to port of new york authority control under a lease with new york city on june laguardia opened with four runways at degree angles to each other the longest being ft m runway was closed soon after a united dc ran off the south end in runway ft was closed around allowing laguardia s terminal to expand northward after circa runway was shifted northeastward to allow construction of a parallel taxiway such amenities being unknown when lga was built and in both remaining runways were extended to their present ft m the april official airline guide shows weekday fixed wing departures from laguardia american eastern northeast twa capital and united american s flights included nonstops to boston and to washington national mostly convair s jet flights united s to cleveland and chicago started on june although laguardia was a large airport for the era in which it was built it soon became too small starting in general aviation aircraft were charged heavy fees to operate from laguardia during peak hours driving many lga operators to airports such as teterboro airport in teterboro new jersey the increase in traffic at laguardia and safety concerns prompted the closure of nearby flushing airport in also in to further combat overcrowding at lga the port authority instituted a sunday thru friday perimeter rule banning nonstop flights from laguardia to cities more than miles km away at the time denver was the only such city with nonstop flights and it became the only exception to the rule in western airlines hoped to fly s nonstop to salt lake city and unsuccessfully challenged the rule in federal court later the port authority also moved to connect jfk and newark airport to regional rail networks with the airtrain newark and airtrain jfk in an attempt to make these more distant airports competitive with laguardia in addition to these local regulations the faa also limited the number of flights and types of aircraft that could operate at laguardia laguardia s traffic continued to grow by the airport routinely experienced overcrowding delays many more than an hour long that year congress passed legislation to revoke the federal traffic limits on laguardia by the reduced demand for air travel following the september terrorist attacks on new york city quickly slowed laguardia s traffic growth helping to mitigate the airport s delays ongoing port authority investments to renovate the central terminal building and improve the airfield layout have also made the airport s operations more efficient in recent years faa approved instrument departure procedure whitestone climb and the expressway visual approach to runway when when adopting the expressway approach when the aircraft crosses the intersection of i and the long island expressway in long island city it turns northeast on and follows the long island expressway after reaching flushing meadow park the aircraft executes a left turn over the flushing bay and joins the final approach to the runway when adopting whitestone climb aircraft will circle over flushing and head to whitestone bridge on the north upon takeoff from runway such patterns aim to reduce the noise avoid the traffic of the jfk airport and maximize the air traffic capacity in the new york tracon in late construction began to replace the wallace harrison designed air traffic control tower built in with a more modern one the tower began operations on october on august delta air lines and us airways announced a landing slot and terminal swap in separate press releases under the swap plan us airways would have given delta operating slot pairs at laguardia us airways in return would have received operating slot pairs at ronald reagan national airport in washington d c and be granted the authority to begin service from the us to s o paulo brazil and tokyo japan when the swap plan was complete delta shuttle operations would have moved from the marine air terminal to terminal c the present us airways terminal and terminals c and d would have been connected together us airways shuttle flights would have moved to the marine air terminal and mainline us airways flights would have moved to terminal d the present delta terminal the united states department of transportation announced that they would approve the delta us airways transaction under the condition that they sell slots to other airlines delta and us airways dropped the slot swap deal in early july and both airlines filed a court appeal in may both airlines announced that they would resubmit their proposal of the slot swap to the us dot it was tentatively approved by the us dot on july the slot swap received final approval from the us dot on october on december delta air lines announced plans to open a new domestic hub at laguardia airport the investment was the largest single expansion by any carrier at laguardia in decades with flights increasing by more than percent and destinations by more than percent by summer delta increased operations to daily flights between laguardia and more than cities more than any other airline at laguardia in november southwest airlines ended service to newark primarily due to the boeing max groundings poor performance and inadequate facilities and consolidated its new york area operations to laguardia and islip in april port authority director christopher ward announced that the agency had hired consultants to explore a full demolition and rebuilding of laguardia s central terminal the project would create a unified modern and efficient plan for the airport currently an amalgam of decades of additions and modifications the project expected to cost billion will include the demolition of the existing central terminal building and its four concourses garage hangar and frontage roads building temporary facilities and designing and building a new central terminal building the rebuilding would be staged in phases in order to maintain operations throughout the project proposals were due on january patrick foye executive director of the port authority said it s got a quaint nostalgic but unacceptable kind of the s s feel that s just not acceptable the port authority was seeking a private company to develop and operate the replacement terminal with private funds similar to how delta operates the other terminals at the airport however in january governor andrew cuomo announced a plan for the state to oversee the construction of the long stalled new terminal project instead of the proposed public private partnership on july governor andrew cuomo joined by then vice president joe biden announced a billion plan to rebuild the terminals as one contiguous building with terminal bridges connecting buildings airport officials and planners had concluded that the airport essentially had to be torn down and rebuilt under the airport reconstruction plan disclosed in a single terminal building is to be constructed in stages with a people mover retail space and a new hotel some miles km of additional taxiways are to be built a people mover is to connect the new terminal sections the grand central parkway is to be reconfigured and airtrain laguardia previously announced will connect the airport to the mets willets point subway station and the mets willets point lirr station a proposed high speed ferry if introduced will service the marine air terminal a national historic landmark which will remain intact an onsite tram has also been proposed to move passengers more quickly within the central terminal the new airport is to be eco friendly and contain accommodations such as a hotel of approximately rooms and a business conference center the entire airport will move feet m closer to the grand central parkway new parking garages replaced parking facilities between the existing terminals and grand central parkway creating space for the new facilities by locating the terminals closer to the grand central parkway additional space for aircraft taxiways and hold areas was created reducing ground delays the runways themselves were not reconfigured construction of the project s first phase started in spring of once final plans were approved by the port authority board with the entire redevelopment scheduled to be completed by late terminal b will be demolished and delta will rebuild its terminals c and d in coordination with the plan the new airport will feature an island gate system with passengers connecting between the terminal building and the gates via bridges that will be high enough for aircraft to taxi under in late march the comprehensive plans for the redevelopment were approved unanimously between the port authority of new york new jersey and laguardia gateway partners for the terminal b project construction costs were estimated to range from billion to billion in august magic johnson enterprises and loop capital created a joint venture named jlc capital to invest in phase of laguardia airport s reconstruction the same month delta broke ground on the last phase of the airport s reconstruction on december six airlines moved at lga in anticipation of the new terminals alaska airlines and jetblue moved to the marine air terminal american consolidated in terminal b frontier and spirit depart from terminal c and arrive at terminal d since the move there have been further changes with alaska airlines ending service to laguardia jetblue moving all but boston flights to terminal b and spirit consolidating its operations in terminal a laguardia gateway partners which manages the construction of terminal b has completed most of the complex the first half of the seven level west parking garage opened in february with of parking spaces being made available and the rest of the garage was opened later that year eleven new gates at terminal b opened on december and were used by air canada american airlines and southwest airlines five additional gates opened on june when united relocated most of its operations to the new concourse the new space included a concourse with a foot tall m ceiling food concessions an fao schwarz toy store and an indoor play area the new headhouse at terminal b opened on june along with the new connector to the eastern concourse on august american opened the first seven gates of the western concourse with ten additional gates and the bridge connector scheduled to open at the end of the second bridge connecting to terminal b was later completed and opened to the public on january on the east side of the airport delta is consolidating its two terminals terminal c and d into a centralized terminal c headhouse which is located on the former terminal d parking site in addition delta is rebuilding its airside facilities into four finger concourses the first concourse to open was concourse g on the eastern end of the airport which opened on october delta shuttle flights moved to the concourse g on november on june delta unveiled its new terminal c headhouse to the public in tandem with concourse e which boasts narrow body gates the terminal c headhouse consolidates the former terminal c and d s security checkpoint into lanes which if necessary can be expanded to lanes other features include a dedicated drop off area for carry on only passengers biometric scanning technology a sensory room designed for those with autism and delta s largest sky club to date as of june delta is in the process of replacing terminal d s gates and will start construction of concourse d delta is fast tracking its remaining projects at terminal c due to the impacts from the covid pandemic which allowed the airline to use the decrease in passage traffic to speed up construction by two years while laguardia frequently accommodates general aviation the airport is primarily serviced by part scheduled air carriers providing passenger service to regional domestic and limited international destinations because of its congested nature and proximity to dense urban neighborhoods commercial flights to and from the airport are subject to several restrictions enacted by both the federal aviation administration faa and the port authority of new york and new jersey panynj the airport almost only ever handles narrow body aircraft and can handle airplane design group adg iv widebody aircraft such as the boeing and the airbus a however these aircraft in this group are rarely seen at laguardia the airport does not have u s customs and border protection cbp facilities as such international arrivals are only possible from airports serviced by united states border preclearance passengers and crewmembers on these flights clear customs at their departure airport and for immigration purposes are considered to be on the us territory during their entire journey allowing them to exit laguardia in the same manner as domestic travelers to mitigate the impact of aircraft noise pollution and facilitate airfield maintenance a seasonal curfew traditionally exists between the hours of am and am during the warm months of the year additionally a perimeter rule implemented by panynj bars airline flights to and from points farther than miles km except on saturdays or to denver colorado with long haul operations generally requiring heavier fuel loads and larger aircraft the regulation aims to eliminate excess perceived noise generated by such flights changes to the perimeter rule were considered as recently as but a new york state senate bill was introduced in with the intent of codifying the rule into law as one of the united states most dense and congested class b airports laguardia s ifr operations are governed by an faa slot system operators are granted time sensitive individual takeoff and landing rights in accordance with the international air transport association s worldwide airport slot guidelines wasg in the faa responded to drastic reductions in air traffic caused by the covid pandemic by suspending the expiration of unused slots at several us airports including laguardia laguardia has three active terminals a b and c with gates the terminals are all connected by buses and walkways signage throughout the terminals was designed by paul mijksenaar as with the other port authority airports some terminals at laguardia are managed and maintained by airlines themselves terminal b was under direct port authority operation however in operation of terminal b was transferred to a private company laguardia gateway partners laguardia is undergoing a multi billion dollar redesign that resulted in a new terminal b and a new terminal c encompassing the old terminals c and d terminal a remains unchanged except for minor updates the new layout will consist of new gate concourses as well the new terminal b has two gate concourses referred to as the western concourse gates and eastern concourse gates the new terminal c has four gate concourses numbered and terminal a known as the marine air terminal mat was the airport s original terminal for overseas flights the waterfront terminal was designed to serve the fleet of flying boats or clippers of pan american airways america s main international airline throughout the s and s when a clipper landed in long island sound it taxied to a dock where passengers could disembark into the terminal during world war ii new four engine land planes were developed and flying boats stopped carrying scheduled passengers out of new york after the last pan american flight left the terminal in february bound for bermuda inside the terminal hangs flight a mural measuring feet meters in height and feet m in length it was the largest mural created as part of the great depression era works progress administration wpa completed by james brooks in flight depicts the history of humanity s involvement with flight the mural was painted over without explanation by the port authority of new york and new jersey in the s possibly because some saw left wing symbolism in it after an extensive restoration project headed by aviation historian geoffrey arend the mural was rededicated in in pan am restarted flights at the mat with the purchase of new york air s shuttle service between boston new york city and washington d c in delta air lines bought the pan am shuttle and subsequently started service from the mat on september in the mat was designated as a historic landmark a million restoration was completed in time for the airport s th anniversary of commercial flights on december on december jetblue and alaska airlines relocated to the mat while delta consolidated all delta shuttle flights to terminal c on october alaska airlines ended all service from laguardia airport leaving jetblue as the terminal s only tenant on april spirit airlines started operating its fort lauderdale bound flights from terminal a on july jetblue announced that they will be relocating from the mat to terminal b a move they completed on july with the relocation of boston flights to terminal b on march all flights operated by spirit airlines now operate out of the mat on september of that year frontier airlines moved all of its flights to terminal a terminal b serves many airlines and it functions as a large hub for american airlines in work started on the first of two new concourses which replaced the old a b c and d concourses the new terminal was designed by hellmuth obata kassabaum in the new terminal b headhouse opened with a bridge connecting it to the completed eastern concourse on january a second bridge was completed connecting terminal b s headhouse to the western concourse in the old terminal b was demolished on october jetblue moved to terminal b except for flights to boston as the airline wanted to make connections easier with american airlines due to the northeast alliance between them jetblue s boston flights moved to terminal b on july headhouse floorplans western concourse gates in gates at terminal b s new western concourse opened an additional gates and were opened on december along with a new american airlines admirals lounge with the opening of these new gates the old concourse d the last of the old terminal b gates was closed to traffic an additional gates and were opened on april another gate gate came online as of may and on june two more gates gate and gate were opened on july the final two new gates gate and gate opened however gate has been taken out of service to move its jetway to the new gate american airlines now operates all flights in this concourse eastern concourse gates on december eleven gates at terminal b s new eastern concourse opened five additional gates opened on june allowing united airlines to move all of its operations at laguardia to the new concourse on may the jetway from gate was moved to western concourse gate for installation the new terminal c designed by corgan opened on june and connects to four concourses serving delta air lines and westjet d e f and g two of these concourses are new e and g and two d and f are part of the original terminal c and d and will be used while new concourses are completed while the old terminal c and terminal d buildings remain while its concourses are still active the ticketing and baggage operations of these gates have been consolidated into the new terminal c when completed the new terminal c will include access to gates in its four concourses the new terminal c also has a delta sky club the airline s largest as of june these renumbered gates are active the central terminal building was originally six blocks long and consisted of a four story central section two three story wings and four concourses a b c and d with aircraft gates the million facilities designed by harrison and abramovitz was dedicated on april delta and us airways left the ctb in and respectively for their own dedicated terminals on the east side of the airport the port authority and various airlines carried out a million improvement project in the s to expand and renovate the existing space the terminal was replaced by the new terminal b with the final gates concourse d and terminal already demolished in early terminal c formerly known as the east end terminal and usair terminal was a square foot m facility that opened september at a cost of million designed by william nicholas bodouva associates architects and planners it housed part of delta s operations at laguardia on june terminal c s check in and baggage claim areas were closed the building was initially conceived in a agreement between the port authority and texas air corporation then owner of continental airlines and eastern air lines when eastern was forcibly bankrupted by texas air its assets including the new terminal s leases were transferred to continental continental never moved in and in turn sold the leases along with most of its laguardia slots to us airways as part of a bankruptcy restructuring trump shuttle successor to the eastern air shuttle also occupied the terminal before becoming us airways shuttle as a result of a slot swap deal between delta and us airways as of july delta occupied the majority of the terminal gates c c american the former us airways flights operated some flights from gates c c until december the eastern concourse connected to terminal c has been closed and demolished gates c c and the construction of the new concourse e has been completed the new concourse opened to the public on june this new concourse is numbered for its gates terminal d opened on june at a cost of approximately million and was designed by william nicholas bodouva associates architects to accommodate delta s new boeing and boeing aircraft this terminal also housed northwest airlines and northwest airlink from its opening in until the merger into delta in as of january delta air lines and delta connection operate out of the new concourse g that was connected to terminal d terminal d was connected to terminal c by a foot walkway which opened in early as part of delta s effort to build a hub at laguardia as of september the walkway between terminals c and d were demolished and the construction of the new concourse f is currently underway as of june terminal d s check in and baggage claim areas were closed during the week of september the central and eastern sections of terminal d were demolished the west end of terminal d with a delta sky club and gates remain standing and are still in use this section is connected to the new terminal c via a walkway bridge the remaining gates will stay in operation until the new concourse f is complete which will use gate numbers although there is no separate terminal building for general aviation aircraft a pseudo terminal is operated within the marine air terminal terminal a which is currently run by sheltair aviation providing full fbo services to private and charter aircraft owners pilots including ll and jet a fueling computerized weather and flight planning as well as pilot and passenger lounges to access the general aviation terminal an on airport tenant must possess a sida security identification display area badge for unescorted access transient aircraft owners pilots and passengers must be escorted at all times into and out of the ga terminal and to the ramp and hangar areas by the fbo staff following the events of the terrorist attacks on september the federal aviation administration changed the rules for the landing and departure of general aviation aircraft at laguardia pilots operating a non scheduled ifr flight are now required to make a reservation via the faa s e cvrs system no more than hours prior to the flight s arrival or departure while public charter flights may make a reservation up to six months prior unscheduled ifr flights may only operate at laguardia with a reservation from the hours of am to pm local time monday thru friday and pm to pm local time on sundays
